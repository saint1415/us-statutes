Use of up to 10 percent of beds as nursing home beds by a medical care facility described in subsection A; or\n\n3. Use of up to 10 beds per day among its inpatient hospital beds as swing beds for the furnishing of services of the type that, if furnished by a nursing home or certified nursing facility, would constitute skilled care services by a medical care facility described in subdivision A 1 that is certified as a critical access hospital by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pursuant to Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.). For purposes of this subdivision, a critical access hospital may calculate the 10-swing-bed per day limitation as an average over the fiscal year of the hospital. The State Commissioner of Health shall collect data annually from critical access hospitals that elect to use fiscal year averaging and make it publicly available. In the event the calculation exceeds an average of 10 swing beds in any fiscal year, the critical access hospital shall have the following fiscal year to reduce the fiscal year average to 10 swing beds or below. Any critical access hospital that fails to reduce the fiscal year average to 10 swing beds or below during the second fiscal year shall no longer be able to calculate the 10-swing-bed limitation by averaging on a fiscal year basis and shall calculate the limitation on a daily basis until such time as it has met the 10-swing-bed per day limit for two consecutive fiscal years, at which time averaging may resume. The State Commissioner of Health shall collect data annually from critical access hospitals that elect to use fiscal year averaging and make it publicly available. However, no critical access hospital shall have more than 15 swing beds per day for more than five consecutive days. A critical access hospital shall make a good faith effort and so document the efforts made to place each additional patient in a certified nursing facility prior to exceeding the 10-swing-bed per day limit.\n\nE. The Department shall regularly review the types of medical care facilities subject to the provisions of this article and projects for which a certificate is required and provide to the Governor and the General Assembly, at least once every five years, a recommendation related to the continued appropriateness of requiring such types of medical care facilities to be subject to the provisions of this article and such types of projects to be subject to the requirement of a certificate. In developing such recommendations, the Department shall consider, for each type of medical care facility and project, the following criteria:\n\n1. The current and projected future availability of the specific type of medical care facility or project;\n\n2. The current and projected future demand for the specific type of medical care facility or project;\n\n3. The current and projected future rate of utilization of the specific type of medical care facility or project;\n\n4. The current and projected future capacity of existing medical care facilities or projects of that specific type;\n\n5. The anticipated impact of changes in population and demographics, reimbursement structures and rates, and technology on demand for and availability, utilization, and capacity of existing medical care facilities or projects of that specific type;\n\n6. Existing quality, utilization, and other controls applicable to the specific type of medical care facility or project; and\n\n7. Any risk to the health or well-being of the public resulting from inclusion of the specific type of medical care facility or project on such list.\n\n2020, c. 1271; 2025, cc. 114, 135, 325.",

Shall establish an exemption from the requirement for a certificate for a project involving a temporary increase in the total number of beds in an existing hospital or nursing home, including a temporary increase in the total number of beds resulting from the addition of beds at a temporary structure or satellite location operated by the hospital or nursing home, provided that the ability remains to safely staff services across the existing hospital or nursing home, (i) for a period of no more than the duration of the Commissioner's determination plus 30 days when the Commissioner has determined that a natural or man-made disaster has caused the evacuation of a hospital or nursing home and that a public health emergency exists due to a shortage of hospital or nursing home beds or (ii) for a period of no more than the duration of the emergency order entered pursuant to § 32.1-13 or 32.1-20 plus 30 days when the Board, pursuant to § 32.1-13, or the Commissioner, pursuant to § 32.1-20, has entered an emergency order for the purpose of suppressing a nuisance dangerous to public health or a communicable, contagious, or infectious disease or other danger to the public life and health; and\n\n7. Shall require every medical care facility subject to the requirements of this article, other than a nursing home, that is not a medical care facility for which a certificate with conditions imposed pursuant to subsection B of § 32.1-102.4 has been issued and that provides charity care, as defined in § 32.1-102.1, to annually report the amount of charity care provided.\n\nB. The Board shall promulgate regulations providing for time limitations for schedules for completion and limitations on the exceeding of the maximum capital expenditure amount for all reviewable projects. The Commissioner shall not approve any such extension or excess unless it complies with the Board's regulations. However, the Commissioner may approve a significant change in cost for an approved project that exceeds the authorized capital expenditure by more than 20 percent, provided the applicant has demonstrated that the cost increases are reasonable and necessary under all the circumstances and do not result from any material expansion of the project as approved.\n\nC. The Board shall also promulgate regulations authorizing the Commissioner to condition approval of a certificate on the agreement of the applicant to provide a level of charity care to indigent persons or accept patients requiring specialized care. Such regulations shall include a methodology and formulas for uniform application of, active measuring and monitoring of compliance with, and approval of alternative plans for satisfaction of such conditions. In addition, the Board's licensure regulations shall direct the Commissioner to condition the issuing or renewing of any license for any applicant whose certificate was approved upon such condition on whether such applicant has complied with any agreement to provide a level of charity care to indigent persons or accept patients requiring specialized care. Except in the case of nursing homes, the value of charity care provided to individuals pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the provider reimbursement methodology utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for reimbursement under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.\n\nD.

If it is determined that a public need exists for only a portion of a project, a certificate may be issued for that portion and any appeal may be limited to the part of the decision with which the appellant disagrees without affecting the remainder of the decision. Any decision to issue or approve the issuance of a certificate shall be consistent with the most recent applicable provisions of the State Health Services Plan; however, if the Commissioner finds, upon presentation of appropriate evidence, that the provisions of such plan are not relevant to a rural locality's needs, inaccurate, outdated, inadequate or otherwise inapplicable, the Commissioner, consistent with such finding, may issue or approve the issuance of a certificate and shall initiate procedures to make appropriate amendments to such plan. In cases in which a provision of the State Health Services Plan has been previously set aside by the Commissioner and relevant amendments to the Plan have not yet taken effect, the Commissioner's decision shall be consistent with the applicable portions of the State Health Services Plan that have not been set aside and the remaining considerations in subsection B.\n\nB. In determining whether a public need for a project has been demonstrated, the Commissioner shall consider:\n\n1. The extent to which the proposed project will provide or increase access to health care services for people in the area to be served and the effects that the proposed project will have on access to health care services in areas having distinct and unique geographic, socioeconomic, cultural, transportation, and other barriers to access to health care;\n\n2. The extent to which the proposed project will meet the needs of people in the area to be served, as demonstrated by each of the following: (i) the level of community support for the proposed project demonstrated by people, businesses, and governmental leaders representing the area to be served; (ii) the availability of reasonable alternatives to the proposed project that would meet the needs of people in the area to be served in a less costly, more efficient, or more effective manner; (iii) any recommendation or report of the regional health planning agency regarding an application for a certificate that is required to be submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to subsection B of § 32.1-102.6; (iv) any costs and benefits of the proposed project; (v) the financial accessibility of the proposed project to people in the area to be served, including indigent people; and (vi) at the discretion of the Commissioner, any other factors as may be relevant to the determination of public need for a proposed project;\n\n3. The extent to which the proposed project is consistent with the State Health Services Plan;\n\n4. The extent to which the proposed project fosters institutional competition that benefits the area to be served while improving access to essential health care services for all people in the area to be served;\n\n5. The relationship of the proposed project to the existing health care system of the area to be served, including the utilization and efficiency of existing services or facilities;\n\n6. The feasibility of the proposed project, including the financial benefits of the proposed project to the applicant, the cost of construction, the availability of financial and human resources, and the cost of capital;\n\n7. The extent to which the proposed project provides improvements or innovations in the financing and delivery of health care services, as demonstrated by (i) the introduction of new technology that promotes quality, cost effectiveness, or both in the delivery of health care services; (ii) the potential for provision of health care services on an outpatient basis; (iii) any cooperative efforts to meet regional health care needs; and (iv) at the discretion of the Commissioner, any other factors as may be appropriate; and\n\n8. In the case of a project proposed by or affecting a teaching hospital associated with a public institution of higher education or a medical school in the area to be served, (i) the unique research, training, and clinical mission of the teaching hospital or medical school and (ii) any contribution the teaching hospital or medical school may provide in the delivery, innovation, and improvement of health care services for citizens of the Commonwealth, including indigent or underserved populations.\n\n1982, c. 388; 1984, c. 740; 1993, c. 704; 1999, c. 926; 2000, c. 931; 2004, cc. 71, 95; 2008, c. 292; 2009, c. 175; 2020, cc. 227, 558, 1271.",

The Board shall adopt regulations establishing standards for the approval and issuance of Requests for Applications by the Commissioner. The standards shall include, but shall not be limited to, a requirement that determinations of need take into account any limitations on access to existing nursing home beds in the planning districts. The RFAs, which shall be published at least annually, shall be jointly developed by the Department and the Department of Medical Assistance Services. RFAs shall be based on analyses of the need, or lack thereof, for increases in the nursing home bed supply in each of the Commonwealth's planning districts in accordance with standards adopted by the Board by regulation. The Commissioner shall only accept for review applications in response to such RFAs which conform with the geographic and bed need determinations of the specific RFA.\n\nC. Sixty days prior to the Commissioner's approval and issuance of any RFA, the Board shall publish the proposed RFA in the Virginia Register for public comment together with an explanation of (i) the regulatory basis for the planning district bed needs set forth in the RFA and (ii) the rationale for the RFA's planning district designations. Any person objecting to the contents of the proposed RFA may notify, within 14 days of the publication, the Board and the Commissioner of his objection and the objection's regulatory basis. The Commissioner shall prepare, and deliver by registered mail, a written response to each such objection within two weeks of the date of receiving the objection. The objector may file a rebuttal to the Commissioner's response in writing within five days of receiving the Commissioner's response. If objections are received, the Board may, after considering the provisions of the RFA, any objections, the Commissioner's responses, and if filed, any written rebuttals of the Commissioner's responses, hold a public hearing to receive comments on the specific RFA. Prior to making a decision on the RFA, the Commissioner shall consider any recommendations made by the Board.\n\nD. Except for a continuing care retirement community applying for a certificate of public need pursuant to provisions of subsections A, B, and C, applications for continuing care retirement community nursing home bed projects shall be accepted by the Commissioner only if the following criteria are met: (i) the facility is registered with the State Corporation Commission as a continuing care provider pursuant to Chapter 49 (§ 38.2-4900 et seq.) of Title 38.2, (ii) the number of new nursing home beds requested in the initial application does not exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the continuing care retirement community's total number of beds that are not nursing home beds or 60 beds, (iii) the number of new nursing home beds requested in any subsequent application does not cause the continuing care retirement community's total number of nursing home beds to exceed 20 percent of its total number of beds that are not nursing home beds, and (iv) the continuing care retirement community has established a qualified resident assistance policy.\n\nE. The Commissioner may approve an initial certificate of public need for nursing home beds in a continuing care retirement community not to exceed the lesser of 60 beds or 20 percent of the total number of beds that are not nursing home beds which authorizes an initial one-time, three-year open admission period during which the continuing care retirement community may accept direct admissions into its nursing home beds. The Commissioner may approve a certificate of public need for nursing home beds in a continuing care retirement community in addition to those nursing home beds requested for the initial one-time, three-year open admission period if (i) the number of new nursing home beds requested in any subsequent application does not cause the continuing care retirement community's total number of nursing home beds to exceed 20 percent of its total number of beds that are not nursing beds, (ii) the number of licensed nursing home beds within the continuing care retirement community does not and will not exceed 20 percent of the number of occupied beds that are not nursing beds, and (iii) no open-admission period is allowed for these nursing home beds. Upon the expiration of any initial one-time, three-year open admission period, a continuing care retirement community which has obtained a certificate of public need for a nursing facility project pursuant to subsection D may admit into its nursing home beds (a) a standard contract holder who has been a bona fide resident of the non-nursing home portion of the continuing care retirement community for at least 30 days, (b) a person who is a standard contract holder who has lived in the non-nursing home portion of the continuing care retirement community for less than 30 days but who requires nursing home care due to change in health status since admission to the continuing care retirement community, (c) a person who is a family member of a standard contract holder residing in a non-nursing home portion of the continuing care retirement community, (d) a person who is an employee or a member of the board of trustees or board of directors of the continuing care retirement community, (e) a person who is a family member of an employee or a member of the board of trustees or board of directors of the continuing care retirement community, or (f) a person who is an accredited practitioner of the religious organization or denomination with which the continuing care retirement community is affiliated.\n\nF. Any continuing care retirement community applicant for a certificate of public need to increase the number of nursing home beds shall authorize the State Corporation Commission to disclose such information to the Commissioner as may be in the State Corporation Commission's possession concerning such continuing care retirement community in order to allow the Commissioner to enforce the provisions of this section. The State Corporation Commission shall provide the Commissioner with the requested information when so authorized.\n\nG.

The facility or a related facility on the same campus shall not be granted any open admissions period for any subsequent application or authorization for nursing home beds.\n\n\"Qualified resident assistance policy\" means a procedure, consistently followed by a facility, pursuant to which the facility endeavors to avoid requiring a resident to leave the facility because of inability to pay regular charges and which complies with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service for maintenance of status as a tax exempt charitable organization under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This policy shall be (i) generally made known to residents through the resident contract and (ii) supported by reasonable and consistent efforts to promote the availability of funds, either through a special fund, separate foundation or access to other available funds, to assist residents who are unable to pay regular charges in whole or in part.\n\nThis policy may (a) take into account the sound financial management of the facility, including existing reserves, and the reasonable requirements of lenders and (b) include requirements that residents seeking such assistance provide all requested financial information and abide by reasonable conditions, including seeking to qualify for other assistance and restrictions on the transfer of assets to third parties.\n\nA qualified resident assistance policy shall not constitute the business of insurance as defined in Chapter 1 (§ 38.2-100 et seq.) of Title 38.2.\n\n\"Standard contract\" means a contract requiring the same entrance fee, terms, and conditions as contracts executed with residents of the non-nursing home portion of the facility, if the entrance fee is no less than the amount defined in § 38.2-4900.\n\nH. This section shall not be construed to prohibit or prevent a continuing care retirement community from discharging a resident (i) for breach of nonfinancial contract provisions, (ii) if medically appropriate care can no longer be provided to the resident, or (iii) if the resident is a danger to himself or others while in the facility.\n\nI.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall prohibit the satisfaction of conditions of more than one certificate among various affiliated facilities or certificates subject to a system-wide or all-inclusive charity care condition established by the Commissioner.

      "text": "A. To obtain a certificate for a project, the applicant shall file a completed application for a certificate with the Department and the appropriate regional health planning agency if a regional health planning agency has been designated for that region. Such application shall be filed in accordance with procedures established by the Department. An application submitted for review shall be considered complete when all relevant sections of the application form have responses. The applicant shall provide sufficient information to prove public need for the requested project exists without the addition of supplemental or supporting material at a later date. The Department shall ensure that only data necessary for review of an application is required to be submitted and that the application reflects statutory requirements. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Department from seeking, at its discretion, additional information from the applicant or other sources.\n\nWithin 10 calendar days of the date on which the document is received, the Department and the appropriate regional health planning agency, if a regional health planning agency has been designated, shall determine whether the application is complete or not and the Department shall notify the applicant, if the application is not complete, of the information needed to complete the application. If no regional health planning agency is designated for the health planning region in which the project will be located, no filing with a regional health planning agency is required and the Department shall determine if the application is complete and notify the applicant, if the application is not complete, of the information needed to complete the application.\n\nAt least 30 calendar days before any person is contractually obligated to acquire an existing medical care facility, the cost of which is $600,000 or more, that person shall notify the Commissioner and the appropriate regional health planning agency, if a regional health planning agency has been designated, of the intent, the services to be offered in the facility, the bed capacity in the facility and the projected impact that the cost of the acquisition will have upon the charges for services to be provided. If clinical services or beds are proposed to be added as a result of the acquisition, the Commissioner may require the proposed new owner to obtain a certificate prior to the acquisition. If no regional health planning agency is designated for the health planning region in which the acquisition will take place, no notification to a regional health planning agency shall be required.\n\nB. For projects proposed in health planning regions with regional planning agencies, the appropriate regional health planning agency shall (i) review each completed application for a certificate within 60 calendar days of the day that begins the appropriate batch review cycle as established by the Board by regulation pursuant to subdivision A 1 of § 32.1-102.2, such cycle not to exceed 190 days in duration; (ii) within 10 calendar days following the start of the review cycle, solicit public comment on such application by posting notice of such application and a summary of the proposed project on a website maintained by the Department; such notice shall include information about how comments may be submitted to the regional health planning agency and the date on which the public comment period shall expire, which shall be no later than 45 calendar days following the date of the public notice; and (iii) in the case of competing applications or in response to a written request by an elected local government representative, a member of the General Assembly, the Commissioner, the applicant, or a member of the public, hold one public hearing on each application in a location in the county or city in which the project is proposed or a contiguous county or city. Prior to any required public hearing, the regional health planning agency shall notify the local governing bodies in the planning district. At least nine days prior to the public hearing, the regional health planning agency shall cause notice of the public hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the project is proposed to be located. The regional health planning agency shall consider the comments of the local governing bodies in the planning district and all other public comments in making its decision. Such comments shall be part of the record. In no case shall a regional health planning agency hold more than two meetings on any application, one of which shall be the public hearing required pursuant to clause (iii), if any, conducted by the board of the regional health planning agency or a subcommittee of the board. The applicant shall be given the opportunity, prior to the vote by the board of the regional health planning agency or a committee of the agency, if acting for the board, on its recommendation, to respond to any comments made about the project by the regional health planning agency staff, any information in a regional health planning agency staff report, or comments by those voting members of the regional health planning agency board; however, such opportunity shall not increase the 60-calendar-day period designated herein for the regional health planning agency's review unless the applicant or applicants request a specific extension of the regional health planning agency's review period.\n\nThe regional health planning agency shall submit its recommendations on each application and its reasons therefor to the Department within 10 calendar days after the completion of its 60-calendar-day review or such other period in accordance with the applicant's request for extension.\n\nIf the regional health planning agency has not completed its review within the specified 60 calendar days or such other period in accordance with the applicant's request for extension and submitted its recommendations on the application and the reasons therefor within 10 calendar days after the completion of its review, the Department shall, on the eleventh calendar day after the expiration of the regional health planning agency's review period, proceed as though the regional health planning agency has recommended project approval without conditions or revision.\n\nIf no regional health planning agency has been designated for a region, the Department shall (a) within 10 calendar days following the start of the review cycle, solicit public comment on such application by posting notice of such application and a summary of the proposed project on a website maintained by the Department; such notice shall include such information about how comments may be submitted to the Department and the date on which the public comment period shall expire, which shall be no later than 45 calendar days following the date of the public notice, and (b) in the case of competing applications or in response to a written request by an elected local government representative, a member of the General Assembly, the Commissioner, the applicant, or a member of the public, hold one hearing on each application in a location in the county or city in which the project is proposed or a contiguous county or city. Prior to any required hearing, the Department shall notify the local governing bodies in the planning district in which the project is proposed. At least nine days prior to the public hearing, the Department shall cause notice of the public hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the project is proposed to be located. The Department shall consider the comments of the local governing bodies in the planning district and all other public comments in making its decision. Such comments shall be part of the record.\n\nC. After commencement of any public hearing and before a decision is made there shall be no ex parte contacts concerning the subject certificate or its application between (i) any person acting on behalf of the applicant or holder of a certificate or any person opposed to the issuance or in favor of revocation of a certificate of public need and (ii) any person in the Department who has authority to make a determination respecting the issuance or revocation of a certificate of public need, unless the Department has provided advance notice to all parties referred to in clause (i) of the time and place of such proposed contact.\n\nD. The Department shall commence the review of each completed application upon the day which begins the appropriate batch review cycle and simultaneously with the review conducted by the regional health planning agency, if a regional health planning agency has been designated.\n\nA determination whether a public need exists for a project shall be made by the Commissioner within 190 calendar days of the day which begins the appropriate batch cycle.\n\nThe 190-calendar-day review period shall begin on the date upon which the application is determined to be complete within the batching process specified in subdivision A 1 of § 32.1-102.2.\n\nIf the application is not determined to be complete within 40 calendar days from submission, the application shall be refiled in the next batch for like projects.\n\nThe Commissioner shall make determinations in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) except for those parts of the determination process for which timelines and specifications are delineated in subsection E. Further, if an informal fact-finding conference is determined to be necessary by the Department or is requested by a person seeking good cause standing, the parties to the case shall include only the applicant, any person showing good cause, any third-party payor providing health care insurance or prepaid coverage to five percent or more of the patients in the applicant's service area, and the relevant health planning agency.\n\nE. Upon entry of each completed application or applications into the appropriate batch review cycle:\n\n1. The Department shall establish, for every application, a date between the eightieth and ninetieth calendar days within the 190-calendar-day review period for holding an informal fact-finding conference, if such conference is necessary.\n\n2. The Department shall review every application at or before the seventy-fifth calendar day within the 190-calendar-day review period to determine whether an informal fact-finding conference is necessary.\n\n3. Any person seeking to be made a party to the case for good cause, no later than four days after the Department has completed its review and submitted its recommendation on an application and has transmitted the same to the applicants and to persons who have, prior to the issuance of the report, requested a copy in writing, shall notify the Commissioner, all applicants, and the regional health planning agency, in writing and under oath, stating the grounds for good cause and providing the factual basis therefor.\n\n4. In any case in which an informal fact-finding conference is held, a date shall be established for the closing of the record which shall not be more than 30 calendar days after the date for holding the informal fact-finding conference.\n\n5. In any case in which an informal fact-finding conference is not held, the record shall be closed on the earlier of (i) the date established for holding the informal fact-finding conference or (ii) the date that the Department determines an informal fact-finding conference is not necessary.\n\n6. The provisions of subsection C of § 2.2-4021 notwithstanding, if a determination whether a public need exists for a project is not made by the Commissioner within 45 calendar days of the closing of the record, the Commissioner shall notify the applicant or applicants and any persons seeking to show good cause, in writing, that the application or the application of each shall be deemed approved 25 calendar days after expiration of such 45-calendar-day period, unless the receipt of recommendations from the person performing the hearing officer functions permits the Commissioner to issue his case decision within that 25-calendar-day period. The validity or timeliness of the aforementioned notice shall not, in any event, prevent, delay or otherwise impact the effectiveness of this section.\n\n7. In any case when a determination whether a public need exists for a project is not made by the Commissioner within 70 calendar days after the closing of the record, the application shall be deemed to be approved and the certificate shall be granted.\n\n8. If a determination whether a public need exists for a project is not made by the Commissioner within 45 calendar days of the closing of the record, any applicant who is competing in the relevant batch or who has filed an application in response to the relevant Request For Applications issued pursuant to § 32.1-102.3:2 may, prior to the application being deemed approved, petition for immediate injunctive relief pursuant to § 2.2-4030, naming as respondents the Commissioner and all parties to the case. During the pendency of the proceeding, no applications shall be deemed to be approved. In such a proceeding, the provisions of § 2.2-4030 shall apply.\n\nF. Deemed approvals shall be construed as the Commissioner's case decision on the application pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) and shall be subject to judicial review on appeal as the Commissioner's case decision in accordance with such act.\n\nAny person who has sought to participate in the Department's review of such deemed-to-be-approved application as a person showing good cause who has not received a final determination from the Commissioner concerning such attempt to show good cause shall be deemed to be a person showing good cause for purposes of appeal of the deemed approval of the certificate.\n\nIn any appeal of the Commissioner's case decision granting a certificate of public need pursuant to a Request for Applications issued pursuant to § 32.1-102.3:2, the court may require the appellant to file a bond pursuant to § 8.01-676.1, in such sum as shall be fixed by the court for protection of all parties interested in the case decision, conditioned on the payment of all damages and costs incurred in consequence of such appeal.\n\nG. For purposes of this section, \"good cause\" means that (i) there is significant relevant information not previously presented at and not available at the time of the public hearing, (ii) there have been significant changes in factors or circumstances relating to the application subsequent to the public hearing, or (iii) there is a substantial material mistake of fact or law in the Department staff's report on the application or in the report submitted by the health planning agency.\n\nH. The project review procedures shall provide for separation of the project review manager functions from the hearing officer functions. No person serving in the role of project review manager shall serve as a hearing officer.\n\nI. The applicants, and only the applicants, shall have the authority to extend any of the time periods specified in this section. If all applicants consent to extending any time period in this section, the Commissioner, with the concurrence of the applicants, shall establish a new schedule for the remaining time periods.\n\nJ. This section shall not apply to applications for certificates for projects that meet the criteria for the expedited application and review process established in subdivision A 5 of § 32.1-102.2. Such projects shall be subject to an expedited application and review process developed by the Board in regulation pursuant to subdivisions A 2 and 5 of § 32.1-102.2.\n\n1982, c. 388; 1984, c. 740; 1991, c. 561; 1999, cc. 899, 922; 2000, c. 931; 2004, cc. 71, 95; 2005, c. 404; 2009, c. 175; 2010, c. 646; 2020, c. 1271; 2025, c. 325.",

Every project of an existing or proposed medical care facility described in subsection A of § 32.1-102.1:3 shall be subject to all provisions of this article unless, with respect to such project, the owner or operator of an existing medical care facility or the developer of a proposed medical care facility (i) has, by February 1, 1992, purchased or leased equipment subject to registration pursuant to former § 32.1-102.3:4, (ii) has, by February 1, 1992, initiated construction requiring a capital expenditure exceeding one million dollars, or (iii) has made or contracted to make or otherwise legally obligated to make, during the three years ending February 1, 1992, preliminary expenditures of $350,000 or more for a formal plan of construction of the specific project, including expenditures for site acquisition, designs, preliminary or working drawings, construction documents, or other items essential to the construction of the specific project.\n\nAny project exempted pursuant to subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subsection shall be limited to such construction, services, and equipment as specifically identified in the formal plan of construction which shall have existed and been formally committed to by February 1, 1992. Further, the equipment to be exempted pursuant to subdivisions (ii) and (iii) shall be limited to the number of units and any types of medical equipment, in the case of medical equipment intended to provide any services included in subdivision B 6 of § 32.1-102.1:3, as are specifically identified in such plan and, in the case of all other equipment, such equipment as is appropriate for the construction and services included in such plan.\n\nNone of the exemptions provided in this subsection shall be applicable to projects which required a certificate of public need pursuant to this article on January 1, 1992.\n\nB. Any medical care facility or entity claiming to meet one of the conditions set forth in subsection A of this section shall file a completed application for an exemption from the provisions of this article with the Commissioner by August 1, 1992. Forms for such application shall be made available by the Commissioner no later than April 1, 1992. The Commissioner may deny an exemption if the application is not complete on August 1, 1992, and the medical care facility or entity has not filed a completed application within forty-five days after notice of deficiency in the filing of the completed application. After receiving a completed application, the Commissioner shall determine whether the project has met one of the criteria for an exemption and is, therefore, exempt or has not met any of the criteria for an exemption and is, therefore, subject to all provisions of this article and shall notify the medical care facility or entity of his determination within sixty days of the date of filing of the completed application. If it is determined that an exemption exists for only a portion of a project, the Commissioner may approve an exemption for that portion and any appeal may be limited to the part of the decision with which the appellant disagrees without affecting the remainder of the decision. The Commissioner's determination shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), except that parties to the case shall include only those parties specified in § 32.1-102.6.\n\nC. For the purposes of this section:\n\n\"Formal plan of construction\" means documentary evidence indicating that the facility, the owner or operator of the facility, or the developer of a proposed facility was formally committed to the project by February 1, 1992, and describing the specific project in sufficient detail to reasonably define and confirm the scope of the project including estimated cost, intended location, any clinical health services to be involved and any types of equipment to be purchased. Such documentary evidence shall include designs, preliminary or working drawings, construction documents or other documents which have been used to explicitly define and confirm the scope of the project for the purposes of seeking architectural or construction plans or capital to the extent that such capital was committed or agreed to be provided for such project prior to February 1, 1992.\n\n\"Initiated construction\" means an owner or operator of an existing facility or the developer of a proposed facility can present evidence for a specific project that (i) a construction contract has been executed; (ii) if applicable, short-term financing has been completed; (iii) if applicable, a commitment for long-term financing has been obtained; and (iv) if the project is for construction of a new facility or expansion of an existing facility, predevelopment site work and building foundations have been completed.\n\n\"Leased\" means that the owner or operator of an existing medical care facility or the developer of a proposed facility has a legally binding commitment to lease the equipment pursuant to an agreement providing for fixed, periodic payments commencing no later than June 30, 1992, including a lease-purchase agreement in which the owner or operator of the facility or developer has an option to purchase the equipment for less than fair market value upon conclusion of the lease or an installment sale agreement with fixed periodic payments commencing no later than June 30, 1992.\n\n\"Purchased\" means that the equipment has been acquired by the owner or operator of an existing medical care facility or the developer of a proposed medical care facility, or the owner or operator of the facility or the developer can present evidence of a legal obligation to acquire the equipment in the form of an executed contract or appropriately signed order or requisition and payment has been made in full by June 30, 1992.\n\n1982, c. 388; 1986, c. 615; 1992, c. 612; 2020, c. 1271.",

      "text": "A. The Board of Health shall develop a Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan that shall provide for a comprehensive, coordinated, emergency medical services system in the Commonwealth and shall review, update, and publish the Plan triennially, making such revisions as may be necessary to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commonwealth's emergency medical services system. The Plan shall incorporate the regional emergency medical services plans prepared by the regional emergency medical services councils pursuant to § 32.1-111.4:2. Publishing through electronic means and posting on the Department website shall satisfy the publication requirement. The objectives of such Plan and the emergency medical services system shall include the following:\n\n1. Establishing a comprehensive statewide emergency medical services system, incorporating facilities, transportation, manpower, communications, and other components as integral parts of a unified system that will serve to improve the delivery of emergency medical services and thereby decrease morbidity, hospitalization, disability, and mortality;\n\n2. Reducing the time period between the identification of an acutely ill or injured patient and the definitive treatment;\n\n3. Increasing the accessibility of high quality emergency medical services to all citizens of Virginia;\n\n4. Promoting continuing improvement in system components including ground, water, and air transportation; communications; hospital emergency departments and other emergency medical care facilities; health care provider training and health care service delivery; and consumer health information and education;\n\n5. Ensuring performance improvement of the emergency medical services system and emergency medical services and care delivered on scene, in transit, in hospital emergency departments, and within the hospital environment;\n\n6. Working with professional medical organizations, hospitals, and other public and private agencies in developing approaches whereby the many persons who are presently using the existing emergency department for routine, nonurgent, primary medical care will be served more appropriately and economically;\n\n7. Conducting, promoting, and encouraging programs of education and training designed to upgrade the knowledge and skills of emergency medical services personnel, including expanding the availability of paramedic and advanced life support training throughout the Commonwealth with particular emphasis on regions underserved by emergency medical services personnel having such skills and training;\n\n8. Consulting with and reviewing, with agencies and organizations, the development of applications to governmental or other sources for grants or other funding to support emergency medical services programs;\n\n9. Establishing a statewide air medical evacuation system which shall be developed by the Department of Health in coordination with the Department of State Police and other appropriate state agencies;\n\n10. Establishing and maintaining a process for designation of appropriate hospitals as trauma centers, certified stroke centers, and specialty care centers based on an applicable national evaluation system;\n\n11. Maintaining a comprehensive emergency medical services patient care data collection and performance improvement system pursuant to Article 3.1 (§ 32.1-116.1 et seq.);\n\n12. Collecting data and information and preparing reports for the sole purpose of the designation and verification of trauma centers and other specialty care centers pursuant to this section. All data and information collected shall remain confidential and shall be exempt from the provisions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.);\n\n13. Establishing and maintaining a process for crisis intervention and peer support services for emergency medical services personnel and public safety personnel, including statewide availability and accreditation of critical incident stress management or peer support teams and personnel. Such accreditation standards shall include a requirement that a peer support team be headed by a Virginia-licensed clinical psychologist, Virginia-licensed psychiatrist, Virginia-licensed clinical social worker, or Virginia-licensed professional counselor, who has at least five years of experience as a mental health consultant working directly with emergency medical services personnel or public safety personnel;\n\n14. Establishing a statewide program of emergency medical services for children to provide coordination and support for emergency pediatric care, availability of pediatric emergency medical care equipment, and pediatric training of health care providers;\n\n15. Establishing and supporting a statewide system of health and medical emergency response teams, including emergency medical services disaster task forces, coordination teams, disaster medical assistance teams, and other support teams that shall assist local emergency medical services agencies at their request during mass casualty, disaster, or whenever local resources are overwhelmed;\n\n16. Establishing and maintaining a program to improve dispatching of emergency medical services personnel and vehicles, including establishment of and support for emergency medical services dispatch training, accreditation of 911 dispatch centers, and public safety answering points;\n\n17. Identifying and establishing best practices for managing and operating emergency medical services agencies, improving and managing emergency medical services response times, and disseminating such information to the appropriate persons and entities;\n\n18. Ensuring that the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund shall be contacted immediately to deploy assistance in the event there are victims as defined in § 19.2-11.01, and that the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund become the lead coordinating agencies for those individuals determined to be victims; and\n\n19. Maintaining current contact information for both the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.\n\nB. The Board of Health shall also develop and maintain as a component of the Emergency Medical Services Plan a statewide prehospital and interhospital Trauma Triage Plan designed to promote rapid access for pediatric and adult trauma patients to appropriate, organized trauma care through the publication and regular updating of information on resources for trauma care and generally accepted criteria for trauma triage and appropriate transfer. The Trauma Triage Plan shall include:\n\n1. A strategy for maintaining the statewide Trauma Triage Plan through development of regional trauma triage plans that take into account the region's geographic variations and trauma care capabilities and resources, including hospitals designated as trauma centers pursuant to subsection A and inclusion of such regional plans in the statewide Trauma Triage Plan. The regional trauma triage plans shall be reviewed triennially. Plans should ensure that the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund shall be contacted immediately to deploy assistance in the event there are victims as defined in § 19.2-11.01, and that the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund become the lead coordinating agencies for those individuals determined to be victims; and maintain current contact information for both the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.\n\n2. A uniform set of proposed criteria for prehospital and interhospital triage and transport of trauma patients developed by the Advisory Board, in consultation with the Virginia Chapter of the American College of Surgeons, the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, and prehospital care providers. The Advisory Board may revise such criteria from time to time to incorporate accepted changes in medical practice or to respond to needs indicated by analyses of data on patient outcomes. Such criteria shall be used as a guide and resource for health care providers and are not intended to establish, in and of themselves, standards of care or to abrogate the requirements of § 8.01-581.20. A decision by a health care provider to deviate from the criteria shall not constitute negligence per se.\n\n3. A performance improvement program for monitoring the quality of emergency medical services and trauma services, consistent with other components of the Emergency Medical Services Plan. The program shall provide for collection and analysis of data on emergency medical and trauma services from existing validated sources, including the emergency medical services patient care information system, pursuant to Article 3.1 (§ 32.1-116.1 et seq.), the Patient Level Data System, and mortality data. The Advisory Board shall review and analyze such data on a quarterly basis and report its findings to the Commissioner. The Advisory Board may execute these duties through a committee composed of persons having expertise in critical care issues and representatives of emergency medical services providers. The program for monitoring and reporting the results of emergency medical services and trauma services data analysis shall be the sole means of encouraging and promoting compliance with the trauma triage criteria.\n\nThe Commissioner shall report aggregate findings of the analysis annually to each regional emergency medical services council. The report shall be available to the public and shall identify, minimally, as defined in the statewide plan, the frequency of (i) incorrect triage in comparison to the total number of trauma patients delivered to a hospital prior to pronouncement of death and (ii) incorrect interfacility transfer for each region.\n\nThe Advisory Board or its designee shall ensure that each hospital director or emergency medical services agency chief is informed of any incorrect interfacility transfer or triage, as defined in the statewide Trauma Triage Plan, specific to the hospital or agency and shall give the hospital or agency an opportunity to correct any facts on which such determination is based, if the hospital or agency asserts that such facts are inaccurate. The findings of the report shall be used to improve the Trauma Triage Plan, including triage, and transport and trauma center designation criteria.\n\nThe Commissioner shall ensure the confidentiality of patient information, in accordance with § 32.1-116.2. Such data or information in the possession of or transmitted to the Commissioner, the Advisory Board, any committee acting on behalf of the Advisory Board, any hospital or prehospital care provider, any regional emergency medical services council, emergency medical services agency that holds a valid license issued by the Commissioner, or group or committee established to monitor the quality of emergency medical services or trauma services pursuant to this subdivision, or any other person shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed or obtained by legal discovery proceedings, unless a circuit court, after a hearing and for good cause shown arising from extraordinary circumstances, orders disclosure of such data.\n\nC. The Board shall also develop and maintain as a component of the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan a statewide prehospital and interhospital Stroke Triage Plan designed to promote rapid access for stroke patients to appropriate, organized stroke care through the publication and regular updating of information on resources for stroke care and generally accepted criteria for stroke triage and appropriate transfer. The Stroke Triage Plan shall include:\n\n1. A strategy for maintaining the statewide Stroke Triage Plan through development of regional stroke triage plans that take into account the region's geographic variations and stroke care capabilities and resources, including hospitals designated as comprehensive stroke centers, primary stroke centers, primary stroke centers with supplementary levels of stroke care distinction, and acute stroke-ready hospitals through certification by the Joint Commission, DNV Healthcare, the American Heart Association, or a comparable process consistent with the recommendations of the Brain Attack Coalition, and inclusion of such regional plans in the statewide Stroke Triage Plan. The regional stroke triage plans shall be reviewed triennially.\n\n2. A uniform set of proposed criteria for prehospital and interhospital triage and transport of stroke patients developed by the Advisory Board, in consultation with the American Stroke Association, the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, and prehospital care providers. The Board may revise such criteria from time to time to incorporate accepted changes in medical practice or to respond to needs indicated by analyses of data on patient outcomes. Such criteria shall be used as a guide and resource for health care providers and are not intended to establish, in and of themselves, standards of care or to abrogate the requirements of § 8.01-581.20. A decision by a health care provider to deviate from the criteria shall not constitute negligence per se.\n\nD.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter or the Board's regulations to the contrary, the Commissioner shall, in the rural health care plan, (i) use as minimum standards for critical access hospitals, the certification regulations for critical access hospitals promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pursuant to Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended, and (ii) authorize critical access hospitals to utilize per day a maximum of 10 beds among their inpatient hospital beds as swing beds for the furnishing of services of the type that, if furnished by a nursing home or certified nursing facility, would constitute skilled care services without complying with nursing home licensure requirements or retaining the services of a licensed nursing home administrator. Such hospital shall include, within its plan of care, assurances for the overall well-being of patients occupying such beds.

The State Commissioner of Health shall collect data annually from critical access hospitals that elect to use fiscal year averaging and make it publicly available. Any critical access hospital that fails to reduce the fiscal year average to 10 swing beds or below during the second fiscal year shall no longer be able to calculate the 10-swing-bed limitation by averaging on a fiscal year basis and shall calculate the limitation on a daily basis until such time as it has met the 10-swing-bed per day limit for two consecutive fiscal years, at which time averaging may resume.

Reporting of data related to the recipients of the scholarships by the dental schools.\n\nC. Prior to the award of any scholarship, the applicant shall sign a contract in which he agrees to pursue the dental course of Virginia Commonwealth University until his graduation and, upon graduation or upon completing a term not to exceed four years as an intern or resident at an approved institution or facility, to promptly begin and thereafter engage continuously in dental practice in an underserved area in Virginia for a period of years equal to the number of annual scholarships received.

In the event the recipient dies or becomes permanently disabled so as not to be able to engage in the practice of dentistry, the recipient or his estate may, upon certification of the Commissioner, be relieved of the obligation under the contract to engage in dental practice in an underserved area upon repayment to the Commonwealth of the total amount of scholarship funds plus interest on such amount computed at eight percent per annum from the date of receipt of scholarship funds. This obligation may be waived in whole or in part by the Commissioner in his discretion upon application by the recipient or his estate to the Commissioner with proof of hardship or inability to pay.\n\nF. Except as provided in subsections D and E, any recipient of a scholarship who fails or refuses to fulfill his obligation to practice dentistry in an underserved area for a period of years equal to the number of annual scholarships received shall reimburse the Commonwealth three times the total amount of the scholarship funds received plus interest at the prevailing bank rate for similar amounts of unsecured debt. If the recipient has fulfilled part of his contractual obligations by serving in an underserved area, the total amount of the scholarship funds received shall be reduced by the amount of the annual scholarship multiplied by the number of years served.\n\nG. The Commissioner shall collect all repayments required by this section and may establish a schedule of payments for reimbursement consistent with the regulations of the Board. No schedule of payments shall amortize the total amount due for a period of longer than two years following the completion of the recipient's postgraduate training or the recipient's entrance into the full-time practice of dentistry, whichever is later. All such funds, including any interest thereon, shall be used only for the purposes of this section and shall not revert to the general fund. If any recipient fails to make any payment when and as due, the Commissioner shall notify the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall take such action as he deems proper.
