      "text": "A. The regulations promulgated by the Board to carry out the provisions of this article shall be in substantial conformity to the standards of health, hygiene, sanitation, construction and safety as established and recognized by medical and health care professionals and by specialists in matters of public health and safety, including health and safety standards established under provisions of Title XVIII and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and to the provisions of Article 2 (§ 32.1-138 et seq.).\n\nB.

Shall also require that each hospital establish a protocol for organ donation, in compliance with federal law and the regulations of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), particularly 42 C.F.R. § 482.45. Each hospital shall have an agreement with an organ procurement organization designated in CMS regulations for routine contact, whereby the provider's designated organ procurement organization certified by CMS (i) is notified in a timely manner of all deaths or imminent deaths of patients in the hospital and (ii) is authorized to determine the suitability of the decedent or patient for organ donation and, in the absence of a similar arrangement with any eye bank or tissue bank in Virginia certified by the Eye Bank Association of America or the American Association of Tissue Banks, the suitability for tissue and eye donation. The hospital shall also have an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of tissues and eyes to ensure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors and to avoid interference with organ procurement. The protocol shall ensure that the hospital collaborates with the designated organ procurement organization to inform the family of each potential donor of the option to donate organs, tissues, or eyes or to decline to donate. The individual making contact with the family shall have completed a course in the methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation that (a) is offered or approved by the organ procurement organization and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community and (b) encourages discretion and sensitivity according to the specific circumstances, views, and beliefs of the relevant family. In addition, the hospital shall work cooperatively with the designated organ procurement organization in educating the staff responsible for contacting the organ procurement organization's personnel on donation issues, the proper review of death records to improve identification of potential donors, and the proper procedures for maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes takes place. This process shall be followed, without exception, unless the family of the relevant decedent or patient has expressed opposition to organ donation, the chief administrative officer of the hospital or his designee knows of such opposition, and no donor card or other relevant document, such as an advance directive, can be found;\n\n5. Shall require that each hospital that provides obstetrical services establish a protocol for admission or transfer of any pregnant woman who presents herself while in labor;\n\n6. Shall also require that each licensed hospital develop and implement a protocol requiring written discharge plans for identified, substance-abusing, postpartum women and their infants. The protocol shall require that the discharge plan be discussed with the patient and that appropriate referrals for the mother and the infant be made and documented. Appropriate referrals may include, but need not be limited to, treatment services, comprehensive early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families pursuant to Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1471 et seq., and family-oriented prevention services. The discharge planning process shall involve, to the extent possible, the other parent of the infant and any members of the patient's extended family who may participate in the follow-up care for the mother and the infant. Immediately upon identification, pursuant to § 54.1-2403.1, of any substance-abusing, postpartum woman, the hospital shall notify, subject to federal law restrictions, the community services board of the jurisdiction in which the woman resides to appoint a discharge plan manager. The community services board shall implement and manage the discharge plan;\n\n7. Shall require that each nursing home and certified nursing facility fully disclose to the applicant for admission the home's or facility's admissions policies, including any preferences given;\n\n8. Shall require that each licensed hospital establish a protocol relating to the rights and responsibilities of patients which shall include a process reasonably designed to inform patients of such rights and responsibilities. Such rights and responsibilities of patients, a copy of which shall be given to patients on admission, shall be consistent with applicable federal law and regulations of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;\n\n9. Shall establish standards and maintain a process for designation of levels or categories of care in neonatal services according to an applicable national or state-developed evaluation system. Such standards may be differentiated for various levels or categories of care and may include, but need not be limited to, requirements for staffing credentials, staff/patient ratios, equipment, and medical protocols;\n\n10. Shall require that each nursing home and certified nursing facility train all employees who are mandated to report adult abuse, neglect, or exploitation pursuant to § 63.2-1606 on such reporting procedures and the consequences for failing to make a required report;\n\n11.

Shall require that each nursing home and certified nursing facility ascertain, prior to admission, whether a potential patient is required to register with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1, if the home or facility anticipates the potential patient will have a length of stay greater than three days or in fact stays longer than three days;\n\n15. Shall require that each licensed hospital include in its visitation policy a provision allowing each adult patient to receive visits from any individual from whom the patient desires to receive visits, subject to other restrictions contained in the visitation policy including, but not limited to, those related to the patient's medical condition and the number of visitors permitted in the patient's room simultaneously;\n\n16. Shall require that each nursing home and certified nursing facility shall, upon the request of the facility's family council, send notices and information about the family council mutually developed by the family council and the administration of the nursing home or certified nursing facility, and provided to the facility for such purpose, to the listed responsible party or a contact person of the resident's choice up to six times per year. Such notices may be included together with a monthly billing statement or other regular communication. Notices and information shall also be posted in a designated location within the nursing home or certified nursing facility. No family member of a resident or other resident representative shall be restricted from participating in meetings in the facility with the families or resident representatives of other residents in the facility;\n\n17. Shall require that each nursing home and certified nursing facility maintain, per facility, non-eroding general liability insurance coverage in a minimum amount of $1 million per occurrence, and professional liability coverage in an amount at least equal to the recovery limit set forth in § 8.01-581.15 per patient occurrence, to compensate patients or individuals for injuries and losses resulting from the negligent acts of the facility. Failure to maintain such minimum insurance limits under this section shall result in revocation of the facility's license. Each nursing home and certified nursing facility shall provide at licensure renewal or have available to the Board proof of the insurance coverages as required by this section;\n\n18. Shall require each hospital that provides obstetrical services to establish policies to follow when a stillbirth, as defined in § 32.1-69.1, occurs that meet the guidelines pertaining to counseling patients and their families and other aspects of managing stillbirths as may be specified by the Board in its regulations;\n\n19. Shall require each nursing home to provide a full refund of any unexpended patient funds on deposit with the facility following the discharge or death of a patient, other than entrance-related fees paid to a continuing care provider as defined in § 38.2-4900, within 30 days of a written request for such funds by the discharged patient or, in the case of the death of a patient, the person administering the person's estate in accordance with the Virginia Small Estates Act (§ 64.2-600 et seq.);\n\n20. Shall require that each hospital that provides inpatient psychiatric services establish a protocol that requires, for any refusal to admit (i) a medically stable patient referred to its psychiatric unit, direct verbal communication between the on-call physician in the psychiatric unit and the referring physician, if requested by such referring physician, and prohibits on-call physicians or other hospital staff from refusing a request for such direct verbal communication by a referring physician and (ii) a patient for whom there is a question regarding the medical stability or medical appropriateness of admission for inpatient psychiatric services due to a situation involving results of a toxicology screening, the on-call physician in the psychiatric unit to which the patient is sought to be transferred to participate in direct verbal communication, either in person or via telephone, with a clinical toxicologist or other person who is a Certified Specialist in Poison Information employed by a poison control center that is accredited by the American Association of Poison Control Centers to review the results of the toxicology screen and determine whether a medical reason for refusing admission to the psychiatric unit related to the results of the toxicology screen exists, if requested by the referring physician;\n\n21. Shall require that each hospital that is equipped to provide life-sustaining treatment shall develop a policy governing determination of the medical and ethical appropriateness of proposed medical care, which shall include (i) a process for obtaining a second opinion regarding the medical and ethical appropriateness of proposed medical care in cases in which a physician has determined proposed care to be medically or ethically inappropriate; (ii) provisions for review of the determination that proposed medical care is medically or ethically inappropriate by an interdisciplinary medical review committee and a determination by the interdisciplinary medical review committee regarding the medical and ethical appropriateness of the proposed health care; and (iii) requirements for a written explanation of the decision reached by the interdisciplinary medical review committee, which shall be included in the patient's medical record. Such policy shall ensure that the patient, his agent, or the person authorized to make medical decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 (a) are informed of the patient's right to obtain his medical record and to obtain an independent medical opinion and (b) afforded reasonable opportunity to participate in the medical review committee meeting. Nothing in such policy shall prevent the patient, his agent, or the person authorized to make medical decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 from obtaining legal counsel to represent the patient or from seeking other remedies available at law, including seeking court review, provided that the patient, his agent, or the person authorized to make medical decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986, or legal counsel provides written notice to the chief executive officer of the hospital within 14 days of the date on which the physician's determination that proposed medical treatment is medically or ethically inappropriate is documented in the patient's medical record;\n\n22. Shall require every hospital with an emergency department to establish a security plan. Such security plan shall be developed using standards established by the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety or other industry standard and shall be based on the results of a security risk assessment of each emergency department location of the hospital and shall include the presence of at least one off-duty law-enforcement officer or trained security personnel who is present in the emergency department at all times as indicated to be necessary and appropriate by the security risk assessment. Such security plan shall be based on identified risks for the emergency department, including trauma level designation, overall volume, volume of psychiatric and forensic patients, incidents of violence against staff, and level of injuries sustained from such violence, and prevalence of crime in the community, in consultation with the emergency department medical director and nurse director. The security plan shall also outline training requirements for security personnel in the potential use of and response to weapons, defensive tactics, de-escalation techniques, appropriate physical restraint and seclusion techniques, crisis intervention, and trauma-informed approaches. Such training shall also include instruction on safely addressing situations involving patients, family members, or other persons who pose a risk of harm to themselves or others due to mental illness or substance abuse or who are experiencing a mental health crisis. Such training requirements may be satisfied through completion of the Department of Criminal Justice Services minimum training standards for auxiliary police officers as required by § 15.2-1731. The Commissioner shall provide a waiver from the requirement that at least one off-duty law-enforcement officer or trained security personnel be present at all times in the emergency department if the hospital demonstrates that a different level of security is necessary and appropriate for any of its emergency departments based upon findings in the security risk assessment;\n\n23. Shall require that each hospital establish a protocol requiring that, before a health care provider arranges for air medical transportation services for a patient who does not have an emergency medical condition as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(1), the hospital shall provide the patient or his authorized representative with written or electronic notice that the patient (i) may have a choice of transportation by an air medical transportation provider or medically appropriate ground transportation by an emergency medical services provider and (ii) will be responsible for charges incurred for such transportation in the event that the provider is not a contracted network provider of the patient's health insurance carrier or such charges are not otherwise covered in full or in part by the patient's health insurance plan;\n\n24.

Shall establish protocols to ensure that any patient scheduled to receive an elective surgical procedure for which the patient can reasonably be expected to require outpatient physical therapy as a follow-up treatment after discharge is informed that he (i) is expected to require outpatient physical therapy as a follow-up treatment and (ii) will be required to select a physical therapy provider prior to being discharged from the hospital;\n\n26. Shall permit nursing home staff members who are authorized to possess, distribute, or administer medications to residents to store, dispense, or administer cannabis oil to a resident who has been issued a valid written certification for the use of cannabis oil in accordance with § 4.1-1601;\n\n27.

Such protocol may restrict the frequency and duration of visits and may require visits to be conducted virtually using interactive audio or video technology. Any such protocol may require the person visiting a patient pursuant to this subdivision to comply with all reasonable requirements of the hospital, nursing home, or certified nursing facility adopted to protect the health and safety of the person, patients, and staff of the hospital, nursing home, or certified nursing facility;\n\n31. Shall require that every hospital that makes health records, as defined in § 32.1-127.1:03, of patients who are minors available to such patients through a secure website shall make such health records available to such patient's parent or guardian through such secure website, unless the hospital cannot make such health record available in a manner that prevents disclosure of information, the disclosure of which has been denied pursuant to subsection F of § 32.1-127.1:03 or for which consent required in accordance with subsection E of § 54.1-2969 has not been provided;\n\n32.

Shall establish fees for the issuance, change, or renewal of a hospital or nursing home license to cover the costs of operating the hospital and nursing home licensure and inspection program in a manner that ensures timely completion of inspections as set forth in § 32.1-126. In establishing such fees, the Board shall distribute the costs of operating the hospital and nursing home licensure and inspection program in an equitable manner across all hospitals or nursing homes and ensure that the amount of such fees shall change no more frequently than annually. Fee changes under this section shall only be initiated if the expenses allocated to the Hospital and Nursing Home Licensure and Inspection Program Fund established under § 32.1-130, plus any state or other funding sources appropriated for the hospital and nursing home licensure and inspection program, are shown to be more than 10 percent greater or less than the annual costs of operating the hospital and nursing home licensure and inspection program in a manner that ensures timely completion of inspections. This analysis shall be conducted separately for hospital fees and nursing home fees, and resulting fee changes shall be established such that fees are sufficient to cover unfunded expenses but not excessive.\n\nC. Upon obtaining the appropriate license, if applicable, licensed hospitals, nursing homes, and certified nursing facilities may operate adult day centers.\n\nD. All facilities licensed by the Board pursuant to this article which provide treatment or care for hemophiliacs and, in the course of such treatment, stock clotting factors, shall maintain records of all lot numbers or other unique identifiers for such clotting factors in order that, in the event the lot is found to be contaminated with an infectious agent, those hemophiliacs who have received units of this contaminated clotting factor may be apprised of this contamination. Facilities which have identified a lot that is known to be contaminated shall notify the recipient's attending physician and request that he notify the recipient of the contamination. If the physician is unavailable, the facility shall notify by mail, return receipt requested, each recipient who received treatment from a known contaminated lot at the individual's last known address.\n\nE. Hospitals in the Commonwealth may enter into agreements with the Department of Health for the provision to uninsured patients of naloxone or other opioid antagonists used for overdose reversal.\n\nF. Hospitals in the Commonwealth shall:\n\n1. Establish a workplace violence incident reporting system, through which each hospital shall document, track, and analyze any incident of workplace violence reported. The results of such analysis shall be used to make improvements in preventing workplace violence, including improvements achieved through continuing education in targeted areas, including de-escalation training, risk identification, and violence prevention planning. Such reporting system shall (i) be clearly communicated to all employees, including to any new employees at the employee orientation, and (ii) include guidelines on when and how to report incidents of workplace violence to the employer, security agencies, and appropriate law-enforcement authorities;\n\n2. Record all reported incidents of workplace violence as voluntarily reported by an employee; and\n\n3. Adopt a policy that prohibits any person from discriminating or retaliating against any employee of the hospital for reporting to, or seeking assistance or intervention from, the employer, security agencies, law-enforcement authorities, local emergency services organizations, government agencies, or others participating in any incident investigation. Such policy shall comply with the provisions of § 40.1-27.3.\n\nG. Each hospital in the Commonwealth shall maintain the record of reported incidents of workplace violence made pursuant to subsection F for at least two years and shall include in such record, at a minimum:\n\n1.

Information about the individual who completed the report, including such individual's name, job title, and the date of completion.\n\nH. Each hospital shall:\n\n1. Report the data collected and reported pursuant to subsection G to the chief medical officer and the chief nursing officer of such hospital on, at a minimum, a quarterly basis; and\n\n2. Send a report to the Department on an annual basis that includes, at a minimum, the number of incidents of workplace violence voluntarily reported by an employee pursuant to subsection F. Any report made to the Department pursuant to this subdivision shall be aggregated to remove any personally identifiable information.\n\nI.

The health care entity shall comply with the judgment of the reviewing physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor. The health care entity shall permit copying and examination of the health record by such other physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor designated by either the individual at his own expense or by the health care entity at its expense.\n\nAny health record copied for review by any such designated physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor shall be accompanied by a statement from the custodian of the health record that the individual's treating physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor determined that the individual's review of his health record would be reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or would be reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to a person referenced in the health record who is not a health care provider.\n\nFurther, nothing herein shall be construed as giving, or interpreted to bestow the right to receive copies of, or otherwise obtain access to, psychotherapy notes to any individual or any person authorized to act on his behalf.\n\nG. A written authorization to allow release of an individual's health records shall substantially include the following information:\n\nAUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL HEALTH RECORDS\n\nIndividual's Name ________\n\nHealth Care Entity's Name ________\n\nPerson, Agency, or Health Care Entity to whom disclosure is to be made\n\nInformation or Health Records to be disclosed\n\nPurpose of Disclosure or at the Request of the Individual\n\nAs the person signing this authorization, I understand that I am giving my permission to the above-named health care entity for disclosure of confidential health records.

A copy of this authorization and a notation concerning the persons or agencies to whom disclosure was made shall be included with my original health records.

Pursuant to this subsection:\n\n1. Unless excepted from these provisions in subdivision 9, no party to a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding shall request the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum for another party's health records or cause a subpoena duces tecum to be issued by an attorney unless a copy of the request for the subpoena or a copy of the attorney-issued subpoena is provided to the other party's counsel or to the other party if pro se, simultaneously with filing the request or issuance of the subpoena. No party to an action or proceeding shall request or cause the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum for the health records of a nonparty witness unless a copy of the request for the subpoena or a copy of the attorney-issued subpoena is provided to the nonparty witness simultaneously with filing the request or issuance of the attorney-issued subpoena.\n\nNo subpoena duces tecum for health records shall set a return date earlier than 15 days from the date of the subpoena except by order of a court or administrative agency for good cause shown. When a court or administrative agency directs that health records be disclosed pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum earlier than 15 days from the date of the subpoena, a copy of the order shall accompany the subpoena.\n\nAny party requesting a subpoena duces tecum for health records or on whose behalf the subpoena duces tecum is being issued shall have the duty to determine whether the individual whose health records are being sought is pro se or a nonparty.\n\nIn instances where health records being subpoenaed are those of a pro se party or nonparty witness, the party requesting or issuing the subpoena shall deliver to the pro se party or nonparty witness together with the copy of the request for subpoena, or a copy of the subpoena in the case of an attorney-issued subpoena, a statement informing them of their rights and remedies. The statement shall include the following language and the heading shall be in boldface capital letters:\n\nNOTICE TO INDIVIDUAL\n\nThe attached document means that ________(insert name of party requesting or causing issuance of the subpoena) has either asked the court or administrative agency to issue a subpoena or a subpoena has been issued by the other party's attorney to your doctor, other health care providers ________(names of health care providers inserted here) or other health care entity ________(name of health care entity to be inserted here) requiring them to produce your health records. Your doctor, other health care provider or other health care entity is required to respond by providing a copy of your health records. If you believe your health records should not be disclosed and object to their disclosure, you have the right to file a motion with the clerk of the court or the administrative agency to quash the subpoena. If you elect to file a motion to quash, such motion must be filed within 15 days of the date of the request or of the attorney-issued subpoena. You may contact the clerk's office or the administrative agency to determine the requirements that must be satisfied when filing a motion to quash and you may elect to contact an attorney to represent your interest. If you elect to file a motion to quash, you must notify your doctor, other health care provider(s), or other health care entity, that you are filing the motion so that the health care provider or health care entity knows to send the health records to the clerk of court or administrative agency in a sealed envelope or package for safekeeping while your motion is decided.\n\n2. Any party filing a request for a subpoena duces tecum or causing such a subpoena to be issued for an individual's health records shall include a Notice in the same part of the request in which the recipient of the subpoena duces tecum is directed where and when to return the health records. Such notice shall be in boldface capital letters and shall include the following language:\n\nNOTICE TO HEALTH CARE ENTITIES\n\nA COPY OF THIS SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE HEALTH RECORDS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR HIS COUNSEL. YOU OR THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO FILE A MOTION TO QUASH (OBJECT TO) THE ATTACHED SUBPOENA. IF YOU ELECT TO FILE A MOTION TO QUASH, YOU MUST FILE THE MOTION WITHIN 15 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THIS SUBPOENA.\n\nYOU MUST NOT RESPOND TO THIS SUBPOENA UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED WRITTEN CERTIFICATION FROM THE PARTY ON WHOSE BEHALF THE SUBPOENA WAS ISSUED THAT THE TIME FOR FILING A MOTION TO QUASH HAS ELAPSED AND THAT:\n\nNO MOTION TO QUASH WAS FILED; OR\n\nANY MOTION TO QUASH HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY THE COURT OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY AND THE DISCLOSURES SOUGHT ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUCH RESOLUTION.\n\nIF YOU RECEIVE NOTICE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE HEALTH RECORDS ARE BEING REQUESTED HAS FILED A MOTION TO QUASH THIS SUBPOENA, OR IF YOU FILE A MOTION TO QUASH THIS SUBPOENA, YOU MUST SEND THE HEALTH RECORDS ONLY TO THE CLERK OF THE COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY THAT ISSUED THE SUBPOENA OR IN WHICH THE ACTION IS PENDING AS SHOWN ON THE SUBPOENA USING THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:\n\nPLACE THE HEALTH RECORDS IN A SEALED ENVELOPE AND ATTACH TO THE SEALED ENVELOPE A COVER LETTER TO THE CLERK OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY WHICH STATES THAT CONFIDENTIAL HEALTH RECORDS ARE ENCLOSED AND ARE TO BE HELD UNDER SEAL PENDING A RULING ON THE MOTION TO QUASH THE SUBPOENA. THE SEALED ENVELOPE AND THE COVER LETTER SHALL BE PLACED IN AN OUTER ENVELOPE OR PACKAGE FOR TRANSMITTAL TO THE COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY.\n\n3. Upon receiving a valid subpoena duces tecum for health records, health care entities shall have the duty to respond to the subpoena in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n4. Except to deliver to a clerk of the court or administrative agency subpoenaed health records in a sealed envelope as set forth, health care entities shall not respond to a subpoena duces tecum for such health records until they have received a certification as set forth in subdivision 5 or 8 from the party on whose behalf the subpoena duces tecum was issued.\n\nIf the health care entity has actual receipt of notice that a motion to quash the subpoena has been filed or if the health care entity files a motion to quash the subpoena for health records, then the health care entity shall produce the health records, in a securely sealed envelope, to the clerk of the court or administrative agency issuing the subpoena or in whose court or administrative agency the action is pending. The court or administrative agency shall place the health records under seal until a determination is made regarding the motion to quash. The securely sealed envelope shall only be opened on order of the judge or administrative agency. In the event the court or administrative agency grants the motion to quash, the health records shall be returned to the health care entity in the same sealed envelope in which they were delivered to the court or administrative agency. In the event that a judge or administrative agency orders the sealed envelope to be opened to review the health records in camera, a copy of the order shall accompany any health records returned to the health care entity. The health records returned to the health care entity shall be in a securely sealed envelope.\n\n5. If no motion to quash is filed within 15 days of the date of the request or of the attorney-issued subpoena, the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall have the duty to certify to the subpoenaed health care entity that the time for filing a motion to quash has elapsed and that no motion to quash was filed. Any health care entity receiving such certification shall have the duty to comply with the subpoena duces tecum by returning the specified health records by either the return date on the subpoena or five days after receipt of the certification, whichever is later.\n\n6. In the event that the individual whose health records are being sought files a motion to quash the subpoena, the court or administrative agency shall decide whether good cause has been shown by the discovering party to compel disclosure of the individual's health records over the individual's objections. In determining whether good cause has been shown, the court or administrative agency shall consider (i) the particular purpose for which the information was collected; (ii) the degree to which the disclosure of the records would embarrass, injure, or invade the privacy of the individual; (iii) the effect of the disclosure on the individual's future health care; (iv) the importance of the information to the lawsuit or proceeding; and (v) any other relevant factor.\n\n7. Concurrent with the court or administrative agency's resolution of a motion to quash, if subpoenaed health records have been submitted by a health care entity to the court or administrative agency in a sealed envelope, the court or administrative agency shall: (i) upon determining that no submitted health records should be disclosed, return all submitted health records to the health care entity in a sealed envelope; (ii) upon determining that all submitted health records should be disclosed, provide all the submitted health records to the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued; or (iii) upon determining that only a portion of the submitted health records should be disclosed, provide such portion to the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and return the remaining health records to the health care entity in a sealed envelope.\n\n8. Following the court or administrative agency's resolution of a motion to quash, the party on whose behalf the subpoena duces tecum was issued shall have the duty to certify in writing to the subpoenaed health care entity a statement of one of the following:\n\na. All filed motions to quash have been resolved by the court or administrative agency and the disclosures sought in the subpoena duces tecum are consistent with such resolution; and, therefore, the health records previously delivered in a sealed envelope to the clerk of the court or administrative agency will not be returned to the health care entity;\n\nb. All filed motions to quash have been resolved by the court or administrative agency and the disclosures sought in the subpoena duces tecum are consistent with such resolution and that, since no health records have previously been delivered to the court or administrative agency by the health care entity, the health care entity shall comply with the subpoena duces tecum by returning the health records designated in the subpoena by the return date on the subpoena or five days after receipt of certification, whichever is later;\n\nc. All filed motions to quash have been resolved by the court or administrative agency and the disclosures sought in the subpoena duces tecum are not consistent with such resolution; therefore, no health records shall be disclosed and all health records previously delivered in a sealed envelope to the clerk of the court or administrative agency will be returned to the health care entity;\n\nd. All filed motions to quash have been resolved by the court or administrative agency and the disclosures sought in the subpoena duces tecum are not consistent with such resolution and that only limited disclosure has been authorized. The certification shall state that only the portion of the health records as set forth in the certification, consistent with the court or administrative agency's ruling, shall be disclosed. The certification shall also state that health records that were previously delivered to the court or administrative agency for which disclosure has been authorized will not be returned to the health care entity; however, all health records for which disclosure has not been authorized will be returned to the health care entity; or\n\ne. All filed motions to quash have been resolved by the court or administrative agency and the disclosures sought in the subpoena duces tecum are not consistent with such resolution and, since no health records have previously been delivered to the court or administrative agency by the health care entity, the health care entity shall return only those health records specified in the certification, consistent with the court or administrative agency's ruling, by the return date on the subpoena or five days after receipt of the certification, whichever is later.\n\nA copy of the court or administrative agency's ruling shall accompany any certification made pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n9. The provisions of this subsection have no application to subpoenas for health records requested under § 8.01-413, or issued by a duly authorized administrative agency conducting an investigation, audit, review or proceedings regarding a health care entity's conduct.\n\nThe provisions of this subsection shall apply to subpoenas for the health records of both minors and adults.\n\nNothing in this subsection shall have any effect on the existing authority of a court or administrative agency to issue a protective order regarding health records, including, but not limited to, ordering the return of health records to a health care entity, after the period for filing a motion to quash has passed.\n\nA subpoena for substance abuse records must conform to the requirements of federal law found in 42 C.F.R. Part 2, Subpart E.\n\nI. Health care entities may testify about the health records of an individual in compliance with §§ 8.01-399 and 8.01-400.2.\n\nJ. Except as provided by subsection B7 of § 8.01-413, if an individual requests a copy of his health record from a health care entity, the health care entity may impose a reasonable cost-based fee, which shall include only the cost of supplies for and labor of copying the requested information, postage when the individual requests that such information be mailed, and preparation of an explanation or summary of such information as agreed to by the individual. For the purposes of this section, \"individual\" shall subsume a person with authority to act on behalf of the individual who is the subject of the health record in making decisions related to his health care.\n\nK. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a health care provider who prescribes or dispenses a controlled substance required to be reported to the Prescription Monitoring Program established pursuant to Chapter 25.2 (§ 54.1-2519 et seq.) of Title 54.1 to a patient from disclosing information obtained from the Prescription Monitoring Program and contained in a patient's health care record to another health care provider when such disclosure is related to the care or treatment of the patient who is the subject of the record.\n\nL. An authorization for the disclosure of health records executed pursuant to this section shall remain in effect until (i) the authorization is revoked in writing and delivered to the health care entity maintaining the record that is subject to the authorization by the person who executed the authorization, (ii) any expiration date set forth in the authorization, or (iii) the health care entity maintaining the record becomes aware of any expiration event described in the authorization, whichever occurs first. However, any revocation of an authorization for the disclosure of health records executed pursuant to this section shall not be effective to the extent that the health care entity maintaining the record has disclosed health records prior to delivery of such revocation in reliance upon the authorization or as otherwise provided pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 164.508. A statement in an authorization for the disclosure of health records pursuant to this section that the information to be used or disclosed is \"all health records\" is a sufficient description for the disclosure of all health records of the person maintained by the health care provider to whom the authorization was granted. If a health care provider receives a written revocation of an authorization for the disclosure of health records in accordance with this subsection, a copy of such written revocation shall be included in the person's original health record maintained by the health care provider.\n\nAn authorization for the disclosure of health records executed pursuant to this section shall, unless otherwise expressly limited in the authorization, be deemed to include authorization for the person named in the authorization to assist the person who is the subject of the health record in accessing health care services, including scheduling appointments for the person who is the subject of the health record and attending appointments together with the person who is the subject of the health record.\n\n1997, c. 682; 1998, c. 470; 1999, cc. 812, 956, 1010; 2000, cc. 810, 813, 923, 927; 2001, c. 671; 2002, cc. 568, 658, 835, 860; 2003, cc. 471, 907, 983; 2004, cc. 49, 64, 65, 66, 67, 163, 773, 1014, 1021; 2005, cc. 39, 101, 642, 697; 2006, c. 433; 2007, c. 497; 2008, cc. 315, 782, 850, 870; 2009, cc. 606, 651, 813, 840; 2010, cc. 185, 340, 406, 456, 524, 778, 825; 2011, cc. 499, 668, 798, 812, 844, 871; 2012, cc. 386, 402, 479; 2016, c. 554; 2017, cc. 457, 712, 720; 2018, c. 165; 2020, c. 945; 2022, cc. 509, 534, 784; 2025, c. 182.",

Good faith acquisition of medical information by an employee or agent of an entity for the purposes of the entity is not a breach of the security of the system, provided that the medical information is not used for a purpose other than a lawful purpose of the entity or subject to further unauthorized disclosure.\n\n\"Encrypted\" means the transformation of data through the use of an algorithmic process into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key, or the securing of the information by another method that renders the data elements unreadable or unusable.\n\n\"Entity\" means any authority, board, bureau, commission, district or agency of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth, including cities, towns and counties, municipal councils, governing bodies of counties, school boards and planning commissions; boards of visitors of public institutions of higher education; and other organizations, corporations, or agencies in the Commonwealth supported wholly or principally by public funds.\n\n\"Medical information\" means the first name or first initial and last name in combination with and linked to any one or more of the following data elements that relate to a resident of the Commonwealth, when the data elements are neither encrypted nor redacted:\n\n1.

Notice required by this section may be reasonably delayed to allow the entity to determine the scope of the breach of the security of the system and restore the reasonable integrity of the system. Notice required by this section may be delayed if, after the entity notifies a law-enforcement agency, the law-enforcement agency determines and advises the entity that the notice will impede a criminal or civil investigation, or homeland or national security. Notice shall be made without unreasonable delay after the law-enforcement agency determines that the notification will no longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national or homeland security.\n\nC.

Any person who desires to make any substantial alteration or addition to or any material change in any hospital or nursing home shall, before making such change, alteration, or addition, submit the proposal therefor to the Commissioner for his approval. The Commissioner shall review the proposal to determine compliance with applicable statutes and regulations of the Board and as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable notify the person that the proposal is or is not approved.\n\nB. If any such alteration, addition, or change has the effect of changing the bed capacity or classification of the hospital or nursing home, the licensee shall obtain a new license for the remainder of the license year before beginning operation of additional beds or in the new classification.\n\nC. Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, any hospital, after sending such written notice as may be required by the Commissioner, may utilize, for a period not to exceed 30 days for any one patient, a maximum of 10 percent of its inpatient hospital beds as swing beds for the furnishing of services of the type that, if furnished by a nursing home or certified nursing facility, would constitute skilled care services without complying with nursing home licensure requirements or retaining the services of a licensed nursing home administrator. If the hospital is certified as a critical access hospital by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pursuant to Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.), the hospital may utilize up to 10 beds per day among its inpatient hospital beds as swing beds for the furnishing of services of the type that, if furnished by a nursing home or certified nursing facility, would constitute skilled care services without complying with nursing home licensure requirements or retaining the services of a licensed nursing home administrator. Such hospital shall amend its plan of care and implement its plan as amended to ensure the overall well-being of patients occupying such beds. For purposes of this subsection, a critical access hospital may calculate the 10-swing-bed per day limitation as an average over the fiscal year of the hospital. The State Commissioner of Health shall collect data annually from critical access hospitals that elect to use fiscal year averaging and make it publicly available. In the event the calculation exceeds an average of 10 swing beds in any fiscal year, the critical access hospital shall have the following fiscal year to reduce the fiscal year average to 10 swing beds or below. Any critical access hospital that fails to reduce the fiscal year average to 10 swing beds or below during the second fiscal year shall no longer be able to calculate the 10-swing-bed limitation by averaging on a fiscal year basis and shall calculate the limitation on a daily basis until such time as it has met the 10-swing-bed per day limit for two consecutive fiscal years, at which time averaging may resume. However, no critical access hospital shall have more than 15 swing beds per day for more than five consecutive days. A critical access hospital shall make a good faith effort and so document the efforts made to place each additional patient in a certified nursing facility prior to exceeding the 10-swing-bed per day limit. Only those hospitals that qualify under § 1883 of Title XVIII and § 1913 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and are certified as skilled nursing facilities may be reimbursed for such services for Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\nCode 1950, § 32-305; 1979, c. 711; 1983, c. 533; 1989, c. 618; 2025, cc. 114, 135.",

When the nursing facility has secured and password-protected wireless Internet access or other means available to operate the electronic monitoring device without modification to the nursing facility or a change in level or capacity of Internet access.\n\nC. A nursing facility shall allow electronic monitoring of a resident of a nursing facility if the electronic monitoring is conducted in accordance with this section.

A nursing facility shall not be held liable for any breach of data or privacy related to the presence of the electronic monitoring device.\n\nI. A nursing facility shall require its staff to immediately report any incidents regarding safety or quality of care discovered or reported to staff as a result of viewing a recording from an electronic monitoring device to the administrator of the nursing facility.\n\nJ.

Unless a nursing facility chooses to assume ownership of any recordings from an electronic monitoring device, the resident or resident's legal representative shall be responsible for all aspects of the operation of the electronic monitoring device, including the removal and replacement of recordings; adherence to local, state, and federal privacy laws; and use of firewall protections to prevent images that would violate obscenity laws from being inadvertently shown on the Internet.\n\nL. A nursing facility shall prohibit assigned staff from refusing to enter a resident's room solely because of electronic monitoring.\n\nM. A nursing facility shall make reasonable physical accommodations for electronic monitoring devices, including:\n\n1. Providing a reasonably secure place to mount the device; and\n\n2.

A nursing facility shall require a resident or resident's legal representative to pay for all costs, other than the cost of electricity, associated with the purchase and installation of the electronic monitoring device. In addition, a nursing facility offering facility-managed electronic monitoring may charge a one-time fee not to exceed $150 when the electronic monitoring device is installed along with a security deposit not to exceed $250. A nursing facility may charge a monthly fee not to exceed $10 to cover costs associated with the electronic monitoring device. Such costs may include equipment, secured and password-protected wireless Internet and server capabilities, compliance with life safety and building and electrical codes, maintenance or removal of the equipment, posting and removal of any public notices, or structural repairs to the building resulting from the removal of the equipment.

Such conditions on consent may include: (i) the ability of the resident, any roommate, or staff at the request of the resident or any roommate, to turn off or disable the audio or video electronic monitoring device during certain periods of time and (ii) a prohibition on the ability of the nursing facility to, pursuant to subsection F, choose to assume custodial ownership of any recordings from the electronic monitoring device after the electronic monitoring device has been installed and is operational. If the resident or resident's legal representative or any roommate or roommate's legal representative places any such conditions on consent, the nursing facility and staff shall ensure that the installation, use, and operation of the electronic monitoring device and any electronic monitoring or other activities conducted in connection therewith are conducted in compliance with such conditions.\n\nP. The nursing facility shall conspicuously post and maintain a notice at the entrance to the resident's room stating that an electronic monitoring device is in operation.\n\nQ.

Each nursing facility shall adopt policies and procedures for electronic monitoring consistent with this section.\n\nS. Each nursing facility shall adopt a policy prohibiting staff from willfully tampering with electronic monitoring devices in violation of this section. Adjusting or disabling an electronic monitoring device during the provision of patient care shall not constitute willful tampering if such adjusting or disabling is done in order to protect the dignity of a resident or at the direction of the resident or resident's legal representative.\n\nT. If the placement or position of the electronic monitoring device creates risk to a nursing facility employee, resident, or any roommate, or if the resident or resident's legal representative or family member violates the nursing facility's policies and procedures for electronic monitoring, the equipment may be disabled and removed and the resident, resident's legal representative, or family member responsible for the camera shall be notified of the removal.\n\n2025, c. 432.",
