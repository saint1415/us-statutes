However, the Board shall, pursuant to the requirements of § 2.2-4002, (i) notify the Registrar of Regulations that such amendment is necessary to meet the requirements of federal law or regulations or because of the order of any state or federal court, or (ii) certify to the Governor that the regulations are necessitated by an emergency situation. Any such amendments that are in conflict with the Code of Virginia shall only remain in effect until July 1 following adjournment of the next regular session of the General Assembly unless enacted into law.\n\nD.

Such provider may also apply to the Director for reconsideration of the agreement or contract termination if the conviction is not appealed, or if it is not reversed upon appeal.\n\n3. Refuse to enter into or renew an agreement or contract, or elect to terminate an existing agreement or contract, with any provider who has been convicted of or otherwise pled guilty to a felony, or pursuant to Subparts A, B, and C of 42 C.F.R.

Part 1002.\n\n5. Terminate or suspend a provider agreement with a home care organization pursuant to subsection E of § 32.1-162.13.\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, \"provider\" may refer to an individual or an entity.\n\nE.

The type of long-term services and supports screening performed shall not limit the long-term services and supports settings or providers for which the individual is eligible.\n\nD. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an individual who applies for or requests long-term services and supports as defined in the state plan for medical assistance services is residing in a community setting at the time of such application or request, the screening for long-term services and supports required pursuant to subsection C shall be completed by a long-term services and supports screening team that includes a nurse, social worker or other assessor designated by the Department who is an employee of the Department of Health or the local department of social services and a physician who is employed or engaged by the Department of Health.

Any individual receiving inpatient services in an acute care hospital discharged to a nursing facility for skilled care only is not required to be screened prior to discharge from the hospital unless the individual requests the screening.\n\nF. If an individual who applies for or requests long-term services and supports as defined in the state plan for medical assistance services is receiving skilled nursing services in a nursing facility, or in the situation described in subsection D where the nursing facility screening team is authorized to conduct the long-term services and supports screening, the Department shall require qualified staff of the nursing facility to conduct the long-term services and supports screening prior to or within three business days of initiation of long-term services and supports and in accordance with the requirements established by the Department, with the results certified by a physician prior to or within three business days of initiation of long-term services and supports under the state plan for medical assistance services.\n\nG. If an individual is admitted to a nursing facility and such individual was not screened but is subsequently determined to have been required to be screened prior to admission to the nursing facility, then the qualified staff designated in subsection F may conduct a screening after admission. Coverage of institutional long-term services and supports under this subsection by the Commonwealth's program of medical assistance services indicated by the screening shall not begin until six months after the initial admission to the nursing facility. During this six-month period, the nursing home in which the individual resides shall be responsible for all costs indicated for institutional long-term services and supports that would otherwise have been covered by the Commonwealth's program of medical assistance services, without accessing patient funds. Six months after the date of admission to the nursing facility, and as indicated through the eligibility determination, the Commonwealth's program of medical assistance services shall assume coverage of such services. To the extent that sufficient evidence is provided to indicate that the admission without screening was of no fault of the nursing facility, the Department shall begin coverage of institutional long-term services and supports under this subsection by the Commonwealth's program of medical assistance services immediately upon the completion of the functional screening indicating nursing facility level of care pending the financial eligibility determination.\n\nH. If an individual seeks enrollment in a program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) as defined in § 32.1-330.3, qualified staff of the PACE program may conduct the long-term services and supports screening in accordance with the requirements established by the Department, with the results certified by the PACE program's physician prior to the initiation of long-term services and supports under the state plan for medical assistance services. If a PACE program is unable to complete the long-term services and supports screening of an individual, the screening teams described in subsection D or the acute care hospital described in subsection E shall conduct the screening.\n\nI. In any jurisdiction in which a long-term services and supports screening team described in subsection D or the acute care hospital described in subsection E has failed or is unable to perform the long-term services and supports screenings required by subsection D or E within 30 days of receipt of the individual's application or request for long-term services and supports under the state plan, the Department shall enter into contracts with other public or private entities to conduct such long-term services and supports screenings in addition to or in lieu of the long-term services and supports screening teams described in subsection D or the acute care hospitals described in subsection E. This subsection shall not apply to the specific circumstances outlined in subsection D where the qualified staff of a nursing facility or PACE program agree to conduct such screening.\n\nJ.
