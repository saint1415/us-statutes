Any transfer of hospital facilities pursuant to subsection A is conditioned upon the existence of a binding agreement between the University and the Authority:\n\n1. That requires the Authority to assume, directly or indirectly, hospital obligations that are directly relating to the hospital facilities or any part of the hospital facilities that are transferred, including rentals as provided in subsection C or a combination of rentals and other obligations in the case of a lease of hospital facilities;\n\n2. That provides that, effective on the transfer date, the Authority shall assume responsibility for, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the University and its officers and directors with respect to:\n\na. All liabilities and duties of the University pursuant to contracts, agreements, and leases for commodities, services, and supplies used by MCV Hospitals, including property leases;\n\nb. All claims relating to the employment relationship between employees of the Authority and the University on and after the transfer date;\n\nc. All claims for breach of contract resulting from the Authority's action or failure to act on and after the transfer date;\n\nd. All claims relating to the Authority's errors and omissions, including medical malpractice, directors' and officers' liability, workers' compensation, automobile liability, premises liability, completed operations liability, and products liability resulting from the Authority's action or failure to act on and after the transfer date; and\n\n3. By which the Authority shall accept and agree to abide by provisions that ensure the continued support of the education, research, patient care, and public service missions of MCV Hospitals, including:\n\na. A requirement that the Authority continue to provide emergency and inpatient indigent care services on the MCV campus of the University in locations including downtown Richmond; and\n\nb. A requirement that the Authority continue to act as the primary teaching facility for the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and the Health Sciences Schools of the University.\n\nC. Any lease of hospital facilities from the University to the Authority may include a provision that requires the Authority to pay the University a rental payment for the hospital facilities that are leased. For those hospital facilities for which rent is paid, the rent shall be at least equal to the greater of:\n\n1. The debt service accruing during the term of the lease on all outstanding bonds issued for the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction, or improvement of the hospital facilities on which rent is paid; or\n\n2. A nominal amount determined by the parties to be necessary to prevent the lease from being unenforceable because of a lack of consideration.\n\nD. Any lease of hospital facilities shall include a provision that requires the Authority to continue to support the education, research, patient care, and public service missions of MCV Hospitals, including:\n\n1. A requirement that the Authority continue to provide emergency and inpatient indigent care services on the MCV campus of the University in locations including downtown Richmond; and\n\n2. A requirement that the Authority continue to act as the primary teaching facility for the Health Sciences Schools of the University.\n\nE. All other agencies and officers of the Commonwealth shall take such actions as may be necessary or desirable in the judgment of the University to permit such conveyance and the full use and enjoyment of the hospital facilities, including the transfer of property of any type held in the name of the Commonwealth or an instrumentality or agency of the Commonwealth but used by the University in the operation of the hospital facilities.\n\nF. The Authority may pay to or on behalf of the University some or all of the costs of the hospital facilities. The University may apply some or all of such proceeds to the payment or defeasance of its obligations issued to finance the hospital facilities, and the Authority may issue its bonds to finance or refinance such payment.\n\nG. Funds held by or for the University or any of its predecessors or divisions, including funds held by the University Foundation or the MCV Foundation for the benefit of MCV Hospitals or any of its predecessors for use in operating, maintaining, or constructing hospital facilities, providing medical and health sciences education, or conducting medical or related research may be transferred, in whole or in part, to the Authority if the University or any foundation determines that the transfer is consistent with the intended use of the funds. The University may direct in writing that all or part of the money or property representing its beneficial interest under a will, trust agreement, or other donative instrument be distributed to the Authority if the University determines that such direction furthers any of the original purposes of the will, trust agreement, or other instrument. Such a direction shall not be considered a waiver, disclaimer, renunciation, assignment, or disposition of the beneficial interest by the University. A fiduciary's distribution to the Authority pursuant to such a written direction from the University is a distribution to the University for all purposes relating to the donative instrument, and the fiduciary has no liability for distributing any money or property to the Authority pursuant to such a direction. Nothing in this section shall deprive any court of its jurisdiction to determine whether such a distribution is appropriate under its cy pres powers or otherwise.\n\nH. The Authority shall not operate any hospital pursuant to this section prior to execution of the lease and agreement required by this section and such other agreements as may be necessary or convenient in the University's judgment to provide for the transfer of the operations of the hospital facilities to the Authority, unless and to the extent that the University approves otherwise.\n\nI. The University may assign and the Authority may accept the rights and assume the obligations under any contract or other agreement of any type relating to financing or operating the hospital facilities. Upon evidence that such assignment and acceptance has been made, all agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth shall consent to such assignment and accept the substitution of the Authority for the University as a party to such agreement to the extent that the University's obligations under such agreement relate to the ownership, operation, or financing of the hospital facilities. Indebtedness previously incurred by the Commonwealth, the Virginia Public Building Authority, the Virginia College Building Authority, and any other agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth to finance the hospital facilities may continue to remain outstanding after the transfer and assignment of such agreement by the University to the Authority.\n\nJ. The transfer of the hospital facilities from the University to the Authority does not require a certificate of public need pursuant to Article 1.1 (§ 32.1-102.1 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 32.1. All licenses, permits, certificates of public need, or other authorizations of the Commonwealth, any agency of the Commonwealth, or any locality held by the University in connection with the ownership or operation of the hospital facilities are transferred without further action to the Authority to the extent that the Authority undertakes the activity permitted by such authorizations. All agencies and officers of the Commonwealth and all localities shall confirm such transfer by the issuance of new or amended licenses, permits, certificates of public need, or other authorizations upon the request of the University and the Authority.\n\nK. If for any reason the Authority cannot replace the University as a party to any agreement in connection with the financing, ownership, or operation of the hospital facilities, the Authority and the University may require the Authority to act as agent for the University in carrying out its obligations under such agreement or receiving the benefits under such agreement, or both.\n\n1996, cc. 905, 1046, §§ 23-50.16:17, 23-50.16:20, 23-50.16:21, 23-50.16:22, 23-50.16:23; 2016, c. 588.",

Notwithstanding subsection A of § 2.2-2818, the costs of providing health insurance coverage to employees who elect to continue to be members of the state employees' health insurance plan shall be paid by the Authority.\n\nG. Any employee of the Authority may elect to become a member of any health insurance plan established by the Authority. The Authority may (i) establish a health insurance plan for the benefit of its employees, residents, and interns and (ii) enter into an agreement with the Department of Human Resource Management providing for the coverage of its employees, interns, and residents under the state employees' health insurance plan, provided that such agreement requires the Authority to pay the costs of providing health insurance coverage under such plan.\n\nH.

Any such employee and any employee employed by the Authority between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, who elected to be covered by the Virginia Retirement System may elect, during an open enrollment period from April 1, 2001, through April 30, 2001, to become a member of the retirement plan established by the Authority for the benefit of its employees pursuant to § 23.1-2416 by transferring assets equal to the actuarially determined present value of the accrued basic benefit as of the transfer date. The Authority shall reimburse the Virginia Retirement System for the actual cost of actuarial services necessary to determine the present value of the accrued basic benefit of employees who elect to transfer to the Authority's retirement plan. The following rules shall apply to such transfers:\n\n1. With respect to any transferred employee who elects to remain a member of the Virginia Retirement System or another authorized retirement plan, the Authority shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions to the Virginia Retirement System or such other authorized retirement plan for retirement in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (§ 51.1-124.1 et seq.) of Title 51.1 for such transferred employees.\n\n2. Transferred employees who elect to become members of the retirement plan established by the Authority for the benefit of its employees shall be given full credit for their creditable service as defined in § 51.1-124.3, vesting and benefit accrual under the retirement plan established by the Authority. For any such employee, employment with the Authority shall be treated as employment with any nonparticipating employer for purposes of the Virginia Retirement System or other retirement plan as authorized by Article 4 (§ 51.1-125 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 51.1.\n\n3. For transferred employees who elect to become members of the retirement plan established by the Authority, the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized plan shall transfer to the retirement plan established by the Authority assets equal to the actuarially determined present value of the accrued basic benefit as of the transfer date. For the purposes of such calculation, the basic benefit is the benefit accrued under the Virginia Retirement System or another authorized retirement plan based on creditable service and average final compensation as defined in § 51.1-124.3 and determined as of the transfer date. The actuarial present value shall be determined on the same basis, using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used in determining the funding needs of the Virginia Retirement System or such other authorized retirement plan so that the transfer of assets to the retirement plan established by the Authority has no effect on the funded status and financial stability of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan.\n\n1996, cc. 905, 1046, § 23-50.16:24; 1998, c. 449; 2000, cc. 66, 657; 2012, cc. 803, 835; 2016, c. 588; 2017, c. 314; 2020, c. 1137.",

      "text": "A. Any bond issued under this chapter may be issued pursuant to or secured by (i) a trust indenture, deed of trust, or mortgage of any project or other property of the Authority, whether or not financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds; (ii) a trust or other agreement with a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the Commonwealth or another agent for bondholders; or (iii) any combination of issuance or security set forth in clause (i) or (ii). Any such trust indenture or other agreement, or the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, may pledge or assign fees, rents, and other charges to be received and contain reasonable, proper, and lawful provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including covenants (a) providing for the collection and application of revenues and the repossession and sale of any project or other property by the Authority or any trustees under any trust indenture or agreement upon default; (b) setting forth duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation, and insurance of any project or other property of the Authority and the amount of fees, rents, and other charges to be charged; (c) providing for the collection of such fees, rents, and other charges and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys of the Authority; (d) providing for the creation of sinking funds and the creation and maintenance of reserves; and (e) setting forth conditions or limitations with respect to incurring indebtedness or granting mortgages or other liens. Such trust indenture, trust, or other agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders, trustee, or other agent for bondholders and restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.\n\nB. The Authority may grant mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, and other liens on its real and personal property, including its accounts receivable, to secure bonds. All pledges of revenues of the Authority for payment of bonds are valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The revenues pledged and received by the Authority are subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery of such pledge or further act. The lien of any such pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority whether or not such parties have notice of the lien. The Authority may provide for the recording or filing of any mortgage, deed of trust, security interest, other lien, financing statement, or other instrument necessary or desirable to create, perfect, or evidence any lien created pursuant to this chapter.\n\nC. It is lawful for any bank or trust company within or outside the Commonwealth to (i) serve as depository of the proceeds of bonds or other revenues of the Authority, (ii) furnish indemnifying bonds, or (iii) pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority.\n\nD. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture, agreement, resolution, or other agreements relating to any project, including those to which the Authority may not be a party, may be treated as a part of the costs of a project.\n\n1996, cc. 905, 1046, § 23-50.16:28; 2016, c. 588.",
