The Governor shall provide a copy of each approved plan to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations. All compensation plans shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency by the Office of the Attorney General prior to adoption, modification, amendment, or repeal.\n\nF.

Any change to the chief executive officer's employment contract during any such meeting or any other meeting of the board shall be made only by a vote of the majority of the board's members;\n\n10. If human research, as defined in § 32.1-162.16, is conducted at the institution, adopt regulations pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) to effectuate the provisions of Chapter 5.1 (§ 32.1-162.16 et seq.) of Title 32.1 for human research.
