As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:\n\n\"Authority\" means the Virginia College Building Authority.\n\n\"Bond\" means any bond, note, or other evidences of indebtedness or obligation of the Authority pursuant to this article.\n\n\"Eligible institution\" means public institutions of higher education, as that term is defined in § 23.1-100, the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research, the New College Institute, the Roanoke Higher Education Authority, the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center, the Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center, the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind, and the Wilson Workforce and Rehabilitation Center.\n\n\"Equipment\" means any personal property, including computer hardware and software, and any other improvements, including infrastructure improvements relating to equipment, used to support academic instruction and research at eligible institutions.\n\n\"Project\" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23.1-1100.\n\nB. Providing funds for the construction of projects at eligible institutions is or may be hindered, impeded, and delayed by the high financing costs resulting from the sale of bonds of such eligible institutions in the open market, and it is desirable that the Authority may (i) serve the purposes of eligible institutions by purchasing such bonds and financing the construction of projects at a lower cost, which facilitates such construction and (ii) issue its own revenue bonds for the purpose of paying the costs of such projects.\n\nC. There is an urgent need to provide substantial amounts of new scientific, technical, and other equipment for academic instruction, research, and related activities at eligible institutions so that they may remain competitive in attracting high-quality faculty and obtaining research grants, and it is desirable that the Authority may finance the purchase of such equipment to provide eligible institutions with such equipment at the lowest possible cost, which facilitates the acquisition and supply of such equipment to eligible institutions and increases the purchasing power of their funds, including funds provided by tuition and fees and appropriations from the General Assembly.\n\n1964, c. 607, § 23-30.24; 1966, c. 685; 1986, c. 597; 1996, cc. 672, 689; 2016, c. 588; 2023, cc. 756, 778.",

If it is established to the satisfaction of the Governor that the eligible institution is in default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on its bonds, the Governor immediately shall make an order directing the State Comptroller to make payment immediately to the owners or paying agent of the bonds in default on behalf of the eligible institution from any appropriation available to the eligible institution in the amount due and remaining unpaid by the eligible institution on its bonds.\n\nB. Any payment so made by the State Comptroller to the owners or paying agent of the bonds in default shall be credited as if made directly by the eligible institution and charged by the State Comptroller against the appropriations of the eligible institution. The owners or paying agent of the bonds in default at the time of payment shall deliver to the State Comptroller, in a form satisfactory to the State Comptroller, a receipt for payment of the principal, premium, or interest satisfied by the payment. The State Comptroller shall report each payment made to the governing board of the defaulting eligible institution under the provisions of this section.\n\nC. The Governor shall direct the State Comptroller to (i) charge against the appropriations available to any eligible institution that has defaulted on its bonds pursuant to this section all future payments of principal of and interest on the eligible institution's bonds when due and payable and (ii) make such payments to the owners or paying agent of the bonds on behalf of the eligible institution to ensure that no future default will occur on such bonds. The charge and payment shall be made upon receipt of documentation that the State Comptroller deems to be satisfactory evidence of the claim. The owners or paying agent of the bonds at the time of each payment shall deliver to the State Comptroller, in a form satisfactory to the State Comptroller, a receipt for payment of the principal or interest satisfied by the payment.\n\nD. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any obligation on the part of the State Comptroller or the Commonwealth to make any payment on behalf of the defaulting eligible institution other than from funds appropriated to the defaulting eligible institution.\n\n1996, cc. 672, 689, § 23-30.29:3; 2016, c. 588; 2017, c. 314.",

The Authority may fix, revise, charge, and collect rates, rents, fees, and charges for the use of and the services furnished by each project and contract with any person, partnership, association, corporation, or other public or private body to perform such acts. The aggregate of such rates, rents, fees, and charges shall be fixed and adjusted to provide funds that, when combined with other revenues, is sufficient to (i) pay the uncovered cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating each portion of the project; (ii) pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding revenue bonds of the Authority as such principal and interest becomes due and payable; and (iii) create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the Authority. No such rate, rent, fee, or charge shall be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth other than the Authority.\n\nB. The Authority shall set aside in a sinking fund or other similar fund a sufficient amount of the revenues derived from a project, except the part of such revenues that is necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair, and operation of the project, provide reserves, or make renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements, and improvements as set forth in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the Authority or in the trust agreement securing such revenue bonds. The Authority shall pledge such sinking fund or other similar fund to pay the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as such principal and interest becomes due and the redemption or purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the Authority or in the trust agreement securing such revenue bonds. Such pledge is valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The rates, rents, fees, and charges and other revenues or moneys so pledged and received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act. The lien of any such pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. No resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the Authority or trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund or other similar fund is subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Such sinking fund or other similar fund is a fund for all such revenue bonds issued to finance a project by a participating institution, without distinction or priority of one revenue bond over another, but the Authority may provide in any such resolution or trust agreement (i) that such sinking fund or other similar fund is the fund for a particular project by a participating institution and the revenue bonds issued to finance a particular project and (ii) for the issuance of revenue bonds having a subordinate lien to other revenue bonds of the Authority with respect to the security authorized and, in such case, the Authority may create separate or other similar funds with respect to such subordinate lien bonds.\n\n1972, c. 686, § 23-30.50; 2016, cc. 532, 588, 658.",

The Authority may (i) apply the proceeds of any revenue bonds issued to refund outstanding revenue bonds to purchase, retire at maturity, or redeem such outstanding revenue bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, upon their purchase, or at their maturity and (ii) place the proceeds of revenue bonds issued to refund outstanding revenue bonds in escrow pending such application to be applied to such purchase, retirement, or redemption on the date that it determines.\n\nC. The Authority may invest and reinvest proceeds placed in escrow pursuant to subsection B in direct obligations of the United States, certificates of deposit, or time deposits secured by direct obligations of the United States that mature at such time as is appropriate to ensure the prompt payment of principal, interest, and any redemption premium of the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded, pending the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds. The Authority may apply interest, income, and any profits earned or realized on any such investment to pay the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and any interest, income, and profits earned or realized on the investments on such proceeds may be returned to the Authority for its lawful use.\n\nD. The Authority may invest or reinvest the portion of the proceeds of any revenue bonds issued to pay all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions, or enlargements of a project in direct obligations of the United States or certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of the United States that mature not later than the time when such proceeds are needed to pay all or any part of such cost. The Authority may apply any interest, income, and profits earned or realized on such investment to the payment of all or any part of such cost or use such interest, income, and profits in any lawful manner.\n\nE.
