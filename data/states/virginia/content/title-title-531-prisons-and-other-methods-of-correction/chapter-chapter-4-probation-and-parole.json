Adopt, subject to approval by the Governor, rules providing for the granting of parole to those prisoners who are eligible for parole pursuant to § 53.1-165.1 on the basis of demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders;\n\n3. a. Release on parole for such time and upon such terms and conditions as the Board shall prescribe, persons convicted of felonies and confined under the laws of the Commonwealth in any correctional facility in Virginia when those persons become eligible and are found suitable for parole, according to those rules adopted pursuant to subdivisions 1 and 2;\n\nb. Notify the Department of Corrections of its decision to grant discretionary parole or conditional release to an inmate. The Department of Corrections shall set the release date for such inmate no sooner than 30 business days from the date that the Department of Corrections receives such notification from the Chairman of the Board, except that the Department of Corrections may set an earlier release date in the case of an inmate granted conditional release pursuant to § 53.1-40.02. In the case of an inmate granted parole who was convicted of a felony and sentenced to a term of 10 or more years, or an inmate granted conditional release, the Board shall notify the attorney for the Commonwealth in the jurisdiction where the inmate was sentenced (i) by electronic means at least 21 business days prior to such inmate's release that such inmate has been granted discretionary parole or conditional release pursuant to § 53.1-40.01 or 53.1-40.02 or (ii) by telephone or other electronic means prior to such inmate's release that such inmate has been granted conditional release pursuant to § 53.1-40.02 where death is imminent. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the obligations of the Board under § 53.1-155 for investigation prior to release on discretionary parole;\n\nc. Provide that in any case where a person who is released on parole has been committed to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services under the provisions of Chapter 9 (§ 37.2-900 et seq.) of Title 37.2 the conditions of his parole shall include the requirement that the person comply with all conditions given him by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and that he follow all of the terms of his treatment plan;\n\n4. Revoke parole and order the reincarceration of any parolee or impose a condition of participation in any component of the Statewide Community-Based Corrections System for State-Responsible Offenders (§ 53.1-67.2 et seq.) on any eligible parolee, when, in the judgment of the Board, he has violated the conditions of his parole or is otherwise unfit to be on parole;\n\n5. Issue final discharges to persons released by the Board on parole when the Board is of the opinion that the discharge of the parolee will not be incompatible with the welfare of such person or of society. Final discharges granted prior to the expiration of a period of parole shall be granted only upon approval by a majority of Board members. The Board shall publish an annual report regarding final discharges issued by the Board during the previous 12 months. The report shall include (i) the name of each prisoner granted final discharge, (ii) the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, (iii) the jurisdiction in which such offense was committed, (iv) the length of the prisoner's sentence and the date such sentence was imposed, (v) the amount of time the prisoner has been on parole in the community, (vi) the basis for the final discharge, and (vii) the vote of each Board member;\n\n6. Make investigations and reports with respect to any commutation of sentence, pardon, reprieve or remission of fine, or penalty when requested by the Governor;\n\n7. Publish a statement by the fifteenth day of each month regarding the actions taken by the Board on the parole of prisoners during the prior month. The statement shall list (i) the name of each prisoner considered for parole, (ii) the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, (iii) the jurisdiction in which such offense was committed, (iv) the length of the prisoner's sentence and the date such sentence was imposed, (v) the amount of time the prisoner has served, (vi) whether the prisoner was granted or denied parole, (vii) individualized reasons for the grant or denial of parole, and (viii) the final vote and the names of the Board members who voted in favor of granting parole and those who voted against.

Publish an annual report regarding actions taken by the Board on the parole of prisoners during the prior year. Such report shall contain each monthly statement published by the Board pursuant to subdivision 7 and a summary that identifies (i) the total number of prisoners considered for parole, (ii) the number of persons granted parole, (iii) the number of persons denied parole, and (iv) the most common reasons for which parole was granted or denied;\n\n9. Ensure that each person eligible for parole receives a timely and thorough review of his suitability for release on parole, including a review of any relevant post-sentencing information. If parole is denied, the basis for the denial of parole shall be in writing and shall give specific, individualized reasons for such denial to such inmate; and\n\n10. Convene a public meeting, either in person or via video conference, when conducting the final deliberation and vote regarding whether the Board will grant parole to a prisoner. The prisoner being considered for parole or his attorney shall be permitted to attend such meeting either, in the Board's discretion, in person or via video conference. The victim shall be permitted to attend and participate in such meeting either, in the Board's discretion, in person or via video or phone conference or to provide written or recorded testimony. No decision to grant discretionary parole shall be made by the Board unless such decision was discussed and debated at a meeting at which no fewer than three of the Board members were present. Whether the Board grants or denies discretionary parole to an inmate, each Board member shall identify his reasoning for such decision at the time such member's vote is cast.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 53-238, 53-265; 1966, c. 638; 1970, c. 648; 1973, c. 253; 1974, cc. 44, 45; 1979, c. 625; 1982, c. 636; 1990, c. 538; 2000, cc. 338, 767; 2002, c. 569; 2003, c. 132; 2005, c. 657; 2006, cc. 863, 914; 2009, cc. 813, 840; 2013, c. 708; 2020, cc. 2, 529; 2021, Sp.

For the first time, shall be eligible for parole after serving one-fourth of the term of imprisonment imposed, or after serving twelve years of the term of imprisonment imposed if one-fourth of the term of imprisonment imposed is more than twelve years;\n\n2.

      "text": "The form of the compact shall be substantially as follows:\n\nA compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatures hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled \"an act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes.\"\n\nThe contracting states solemnly agree:\n\n1. That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called \"sending state\"), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called \"receiving state\"), while on probation or parole, if:\n\na. Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;\n\nb. Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.\n\nBefore granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.\n\nA resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this compact, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.\n\n2. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.\n\n3. That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.\n\n4. That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.\n\n5. That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.\n\n6. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.\n\n7. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.\n\nCode 1950, § 53-289; 1982, c. 636.",

      "text": "This article may be cited as \"The Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders.\" The Governor shall execute, on behalf of the Commonwealth, with any other state or states legally joining therein a compact that shall be in form substantially as follows:\n\nThe Compacting States to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each Compacting State in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The Compacting States also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nIt is the purpose of this Compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the Compacting States: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the Compact among the Compacting States. In addition, this Compact will: create an Interstate Commission, which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies and which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this Compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of State Councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.\n\nThe Compacting States recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the Compacting States that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.\n\nARTICLE II.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\nAs used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\n1. \"Adult\" means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute, or operation of law.\n\n2. \"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling the Interstate Commission's actions or conduct.\n\n3. \"Compact Administrator\" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this Compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this Compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this Compact.\n\n4. \"Compacting State\" means any state that has enacted the enabling legislation for this Compact.\n\n5. \"Commissioner\" means the voting representative of each Compacting State appointed pursuant to Article III of this Compact.\n\n6. \"Interstate Commission\" means the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision established by this Compact.\n\n7. \"Member\" means the Commissioner of a Compacting State or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the Commissioner.\n\n8. \"Noncompacting State\" means any State that has not enacted the enabling legislation for this Compact.\n\n9. \"Offender\" means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies.\n\n10. \"Person\" means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private.\n\n11. \"Rules\" means acts of the Interstate Commission, duly promulgated pursuant to Article VIII of this Compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the Interstate Commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the Compacting States.\n\n12. \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia and any other territorial possessions of the United States.\n\n13. \"State Council\" means the resident members of the State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision created by each State under Article III of this Compact.\n\nARTICLE III.\n\nTHE COMPACT COMMISSION.\n\nThe Compacting States hereby create the \"Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.\" The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the Compacting States.

The Executive Committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session, with the exception of rulemaking or amendment to the Compact or both.

Each State Council shall appoint as its Commissioner the Compact Administrator from that state to serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to applicable law of the member state. While each member state may determine the membership of its own State Council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims' groups and compact administrators. Each Compacting State retains the right to determine the qualifications of the Compact Administrator who shall be appointed by the State Council or by the Governor in consultation with the Legislature and the Judiciary. In addition to appointment of its Commissioner to the national Interstate Commission, each State Council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the Compact within that state.\n\nPOWERS AND DUTIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall have the following powers:\n\n1.

To elect or appoint such officers, attorneys, employees, agents, consultants, and to fix their compensation, define their duties and determine their qualifications; and to establish the Interstate Commission's personnel policies and programs relating to, among other things, conflicts of interest, rates of compensation, and qualifications of personnel.\n\n10. To accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, and to receive, utilize, and dispose of same.\n\n11.

The Interstate Commission shall defend the Commissioner of a Compacting State, or his representatives or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees, in any civil action seeking to impose liability, arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the Commissioner of a Compacting State, the appointed designee or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.\n\nARTICLE VII.\n\nACTIVITIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this Compact.

A Member shall vote in person on behalf of the State and shall not delegate a vote to another member State. However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the Commissioner from that State, to case a vote on behalf of the member State at a specified meeting. The Bylaws may provide for Members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where Members are present in person.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. The chairperson of the Interstate Commission may call additional meetings at any time and, upon the request of a majority of the Members, shall call additional meetings.\n\nThe Interstate Commission's Bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such Rules, the Interstate Commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law-enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.\n\nPublic notice shall be given of all meetings, and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the Rules or as otherwise provided in the Compact. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules consistent with the principles contained in the \"Government in Sunshine Act,\" 5 U.S.C. § 552b, as may be amended. The Interstate Commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to:\n\n1. Relate solely to the Interstate Commission's internal personnel practices and procedures;\n\n2. Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;\n\n3. Disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential;\n\n4. Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;\n\n5.

Disclose investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes;\n\n7. Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of or for the use of, the Interstate Commission with respect to a regulated entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such entity;\n\n8.

The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes that shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each Member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its Bylaws and Rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.\n\nARTICLE VIII.\n\nRULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Compact including transition rules governing administration of the Compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the States.\n\nRulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the Bylaws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. § 551 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C.S. app. 2, § 1 et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter APA). All Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.\n\nIf a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State.\n\nWhen promulgating a Rule, the Interstate Commission shall:\n\n1. Publish the proposed Rule stating with particularity the text of the Rule that is proposed and the reason for the proposed Rule;\n\n2. Allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available;\n\n3. Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and\n\n4. Promulgate a final Rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on the rulemaking record.\n\nNot later than 60 days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.\n\nSubjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:\n\n1. Notice to victims and opportunity to be heard;\n\n2. Offender registration and compliance;\n\n3. Violations/returns;\n\n4. Transfer procedures and forms;\n\n5. Eligibility for transfer;\n\n6.

Mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.\n\nThe existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superceded by this Act shall be null and void 12 months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.\n\nUpon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.\n\nARTICLE IX.\n\nOVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.\n\nSection A. Oversight.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the Compacting States and shall monitor such activities being administered in Noncompacting States that may significantly affect Compacting States.\n\nThe courts and executive agencies in each Compacting State shall enforce this Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact, which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.\n\nSection B. Dispute Resolution.\n\nThe Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to the Compact and may arise among Compacting States and Noncompacting States.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall enact a Bylaw or promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the Compacting States.\n\nSection C. Enforcement.\n\nThe Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact using any or all means set forth in Article XII, Section B, of this Compact.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the State and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States, which governs said assessment.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the Compacting States, except by and with the authority of the Compacting State.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its Bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nARTICLE XI.\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT.\n\nAny State, as defined in Article II of this Compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the 35th State. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of nonmember States or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the Compact by all States and territories of the United States.\n\nAmendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.\n\nARTICLE XII.\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.\n\nSection A. Withdrawal.\n\nOnce effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (hereinafter Withdrawing State) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the Compact into law.\n\nThe effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\nThe Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.\n\nThe Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nReinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection B. Default.\n\nIf the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (hereinafter Defaulting State) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\n1. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;\n\n2. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\n3. Suspension and termination of membership in the Compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the Bylaws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.\n\nThe grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, Interstate Commission Bylaws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the majority and minority leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the State Council of such termination.\n\nThe Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.\n\nReinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial Enforcement.\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provision of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and Bylaws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of Compact.\n\nThe Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State that reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XIII.\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThe provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.\n\nThe provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIV.\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS.\n\nSection A. Other Laws.\n\nNothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.\n\nAll Compacting States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding Effect of the Compact.\n\nAll lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and Bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.\n\nAll agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nUpon the request of the party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\nIn the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.\n\n2004, c. 407.",
