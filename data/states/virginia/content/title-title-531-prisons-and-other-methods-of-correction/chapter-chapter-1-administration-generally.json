If the detector canine search, scanning, or wanding indicates the possibility of contraband, the visitor shall have the option of consenting to a search of his person. If the visitor does not consent to a search of his person after only a detector canine search indicates the possibility of contraband and the visitor is otherwise eligible to visit, he shall be allowed a visit with the prisoner that does not allow personal contact. If the visitor does not consent to a search of his person after scanning or wanding indicates the possibility of contraband, the Department may deny the visitor entry into the facility in accordance with the operating procedures regarding visiting privileges as authorized by § 53.1-30.\n\n7.

Any other aspect of the operation of the facility that the Office determines is necessary to assess or that relates to covered issues.\n\nC. Upon completion of an inspection, the Office shall produce a report to be made available to the public online and to be delivered to the Governor, the Attorney General, the Senate Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services, the House Committee on Public Safety, and the Director. The report shall include a summary of all the factors listed in subsection B, any recommendations and a safety and compliance classification with a recommended timeline for the next inspection, and the Director's response to the inspection.\n\nD. The levels of classification shall be as follows:\n\n1. A Tier I classification means that the facility has clear violations of rights, risks to the safety of inmates, or a severe lack of quality programming necessary for the successful rehabilitation of individuals. Such classification shall require a subsequent inspection within 12 months.\n\n2. A Tier II classification means that the facility has violations of rights, substandard conditions of confinement, or substandard programming options. Such classification shall require a subsequent inspection within 18 to 36 months.\n\n3. A Tier III classification means that the facility has adequate conditions of confinement and programming options. Such classification shall require a subsequent inspection within 36 months.\n\nE. The Department shall respond in writing to each inspection report issued by the Office within 30 days of the issuance of the report and in its response shall include a corrective action plan. The Office shall monitor the Department's compliance with the corrective action plan and may conduct further inspections or investigations as necessary to ensure such compliance.\n\nF.

      "text": "A. The Office may initiate and attempt to resolve an investigation upon its own initiative, or upon receipt of a complaint from an inmate, a family member or representative of an inmate, a Department employee or contractor, or others, regarding (i) abuse or neglect; (ii) conditions of confinement; (iii) decisions or administrative actions by the Department; (iv) inactions or omissions of the Department; (v) Department policies, rules, or procedures; or (vi) alleged violations of law by Department employees or contractors that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of inmates.\n\nB. The Office may decline to investigate any complaint. Upon declining to investigate a complaint, the Office shall notify the complainant in writing of the decision not to investigate and shall include the reasons for such decision. If the complainant is an inmate, the Office shall inform an inmate that the inmate is entitled to use the Department's policies regarding resolution of inmate grievances and shall provide information and a complete set of forms to the inmate to complete the resolution of inmate grievances. The Department shall toll any procedural deadlines imposed on inmates for filing a grievance or complaint as part of the administrative remedy process until five business days after the inmate received the information and forms from the Office by inmate legal mail process. The Office shall decline to investigate a complaint if the inmate has failed to first use the Department's policies regarding resolution of inmate grievances, unless the inmate provides evidence that the complaint is legitimate and the inmate made a good faith attempt to exhaust the administrative remedy process and was impeded or procedurally defaulted by no fault of his own. If the Office finds that inmates repeatedly assert their inability to utilize the administrative remedy process despite their good faith efforts, the Office may conduct an unannounced inspection of the facility in question to determine whether the facility is making the administrative process and grievance forms accessible to inmates.\n\nC. The Office shall not investigate any complaints relating to an inmate's underlying criminal conviction. The Office may refer the complainant and others to the appropriate resources or state or federal agencies.\n\nD. The Office may not levy any fees for the submission or investigation of complaints.\n\nE. At the conclusion of an investigation, the Office shall render a decision on the merits of each complaint. The Office shall communicate the decision to the complainant and to the Department. The Office shall state its recommendations and reasoning if the Office determines that the Department, or any employee or contractor thereof, should (i) consider the matter further; (ii) modify or cancel any action; (iii) alter a rule, practice, or ruling; (iv) explain in detail the administrative action in question; or (v) rectify an omission. Upon request of the Office, the Department shall inform the Office in writing about any action taken on the recommendations or the reasons for not complying with such recommendations. Aggregated information related to complaints received and complaint resolutions shall be made publicly available pursuant to § 53.1-17.8.\n\nF. If the Office believes that there has been or continues to be a significant issue with inmate health, safety, welfare, or rehabilitation, the Office shall report the finding to the Governor, the Attorney General, the Senate Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services, the House Committee on Public Safety, the Committee, and the Director.\n\nG. In the event that the Department conducts its own internal disciplinary investigation and review of one or more staff members as a result of the investigation of the Office, such disciplinary investigation and review may be subject to additional investigation and review by the Office to ensure a fair and objective process.\n\nH. Prior to announcing a conclusion or recommendation, the Office shall consult with the Department or any person individually named in the conclusion or recommendation. The Office may request to be notified, within a specified time, by the Department of any action taken on any recommendation presented.\n\nI. The Department and any employees or contractors thereof shall not discharge, retaliate against, or in any manner discriminate against any person because such person has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding pursuant to this article. Any alleged discharge, retaliation against, or discrimination against a complainant may be considered by the Office as an appropriate subject for investigation.\n\n2024, cc. 392, 393.",
