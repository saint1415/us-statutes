With such funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose, school boards shall provide each probationary principal, except probationary principals who have prior successful experience as principals, as determined by the local school board in a school division, a mentor, as described in guidelines developed by the Board, during the first year of the probationary period, to assist such probationary principal in achieving excellence in administration.\n\nB.

The division superintendent shall implement such performance evaluation process in making employment recommendations to the school board pursuant to § 22.1-293.

In the case of a teacher who is the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect and whose license has been revoked pursuant to this subsection, in the event that a court reverses such finding of abuse or neglect and the individual submits to the Department an application for the reinstatement of his license as a teacher, the Board shall consider and act upon such application no later than 90 days after the date of submission. Regardless of the authority of any other agency of the Commonwealth to approve educational programs, only the Board shall have the authority to license teachers to be regularly employed by school boards, including those teachers employed to provide nursing education.\n\nThe Board shall prescribe by regulation the licensure requirements for teachers who teach only online courses, as defined in § 22.1-212.23.

The Board shall establish criteria in its regulations to effectuate the substitution of experiential learning for coursework for those persons seeking initial licensure through an alternate route as defined in Board regulations. Such alternate routes shall include eligibility for any individual to receive, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a renewable one-year license to teach in public high schools in the Commonwealth if he has:\n\n1. Received a graduate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education;\n\n2. Completed at least 30 credit hours of teaching experience as an instructor at a regionally accredited institution of higher education;\n\n3. Received qualifying scores on the professional teacher's assessments prescribed by the Board, including the content-area assessment for the endorsement sought.

The Board shall include in its regulations an alternate route to licensure for elementary education preschool through grade six and an alternate route to licensure for special education general curriculum kindergarten through grade 12. Each such alternate route to licensure shall require individuals to (i) meet the qualifying scores on the content area assessment prescribed by the Board for the endorsements sought and (ii) complete an alternative certification program that provides training in the pedagogy and methodology of the respective content or special education areas prescribed by the Board. The curriculum of any such alternative certification program shall be approved by the Board. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Board from establishing other alternate routes to licensure.\n\nN.

A written contract, in a form permitted by the Board's regulations, shall be made by the school board with each teacher employed by it, except those who are temporarily employed, before such teacher enters upon his duties. Such contract shall be signed in duplicate, with a copy thereof furnished to both parties.\n\nThe standard 10-month contract shall include 200 days, including (i) a minimum of 180 teaching days or 990 instructional hours and (ii) up to 20 days for activities such as teaching, participating in professional development, planning, evaluating, completing records and reports, participating on committees or in conferences, or such other activities as may be assigned or approved by the local school board.\n\nA \"temporarily employed teacher,\" as used in this section, means (a) one who is employed to substitute for a contracted teacher for a temporary period of time during the contracted teacher's absence or (b) one who is employed to fill a teacher vacancy for a period of time, but for no longer than 180 teaching days in such vacancy, unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent on a case-by-case basis, during one school year.\n\nB.

However, local school boards shall (i) establish employment qualifications for temporarily employed teachers that may exceed these requirements for the employment of such teachers; (ii) seek to ensure that temporarily employed teachers who are engaged as long-term substitutes exceed baseline employment qualifications; and (iii) execute a professional development plan with any temporarily employed teacher who is employed to fill a teacher vacancy for more than 90 teaching days that sets forth a mentoring and coaching plan and, for any temporarily employed teacher who is interested in obtaining licensure, a proposed licensure timeline and set of strategies for obtaining licensure by the Board. Any such proposed licensure timeline shall establish a track for any such temporarily employed teacher to apply for licensure by or after a specific date, such as July 1 following the year for which such temporarily employed teacher was employed or such other date as deemed appropriate by the local school board. Each school board shall submit to the Department by October 1 of each year a report on all data on temporarily employed teachers who were employed to fill a teacher vacancy for more than 90 teaching days in such school division in the preceding school year or who were employed before October 1 of the current school year, which shall include for each such teacher (a) the specific school in which he was employed, (b) the grade level or subject area he was employed to teach, and (c) his current licensure eligibility status.\n\nC.

During the probationary period, such probationary teacher shall be evaluated annually based upon the evaluation procedures developed by the employing school board for use by the division superintendent and principals in evaluating teachers as required by subsection C of § 22.1-295. A teacher in his first year of the probationary period shall be evaluated informally at least once during the first semester of the school year. The division superintendent shall consider such evaluations, among other things, in making any recommendations to the school board regarding the nonrenewal of such probationary teacher's contract as provided in § 22.1-305.\n\nAny teacher hired on or after July 1, 2001, shall be required, as a condition of achieving continuing contract status, to have successfully completed training in instructional strategies and techniques for intervention for or remediation of students who fail or are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments. Local school divisions shall be required to provide said training at no cost to teachers employed in their division. In the event a local school division fails to offer said training in a timely manner, no teacher will be denied continuing contract status for failure to obtain such training.\n\nB. Once a continuing contract status has been attained in a school division in the Commonwealth, another probationary period need not be served in any other school division unless such probationary period, not to exceed two years, is made a part of the contract of employment.

Before a division superintendent recommends to the school board nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status, the division superintendent shall consider, among other things, the performance evaluations for such teacher required by § 22.1-303 and shall notify the teacher of the proposed recommendation. Upon written request of the teacher within five working days after receipt of such notice, the division superintendent or his designee shall orally provide the specific reasons, if any, for such recommendation, along with supporting documentation, including such performance evaluations, to the teacher and, if requested by the teacher, to his or her representative. Within 10 days after receiving such reasons, the teacher may request, by notification in writing to the division superintendent, a conference before the division superintendent. Upon such request, the division superintendent shall set a date for the conference, which shall be within 30 days of the request, and shall give the teacher at least 15 days' notice of the time and place of the conference.\n\nB. The conference shall be before the division superintendent or his designee. No such designee shall have recommended to the division superintendent the nonrenewal of the teacher's contract.

The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.\n\nB. The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel without reference to their states of origin can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.\n\nArticle II.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nAs used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\n1. \"Educational personnel\" means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.\n\n2. \"Designated state official\" means the educational official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.\n\n3. \"Accept\" or any variant thereof means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.\n\n4. \"State\" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n5. \"Originating state\" means a state or subdivision thereof whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.\n\n6. \"Receiving state\" means a state or subdivision thereof which accepts educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III of this section.\n\nArticle III.\n\nInterstate Educational Personnel Contracts.\n\nA. The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of his state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it and the subdivisions of those states with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which he finds that there are programs of education, licensure standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable even though not identical to that prevailing in his own state.\n\nB. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n1. Its duration.\n\n2. The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.\n\n3. Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.\n\n4. Any other necessary matters.\n\nC. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.\n\nD. Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.\n\nE. The licensure or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. Any license or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a license or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.\n\nF. A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nApproved and Accepted Programs.\n\nA. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.\n\nB. To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.\n\nInterstate Cooperation.\n\nThe party states agree that:\n\n1. They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement.\n\n2. They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate licensure and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in licensure and other elements of educational personnel qualification.\n\nArticle VI.\n\nAgreement Evaluation.\n\nThe designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement and to formulate recommendations for changes.\n\nArticle VII.\n\nOther Arrangements.\n\nNothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.\n\nArticle VIII.\n\nEffect and Withdrawal.\n\nA. This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two states. Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.\n\nB. Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.\n\nC. No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.\n\nArticle IX.\n\nConstruction and Severability.\n\nThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or if the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nCode 1950, § 22-348; 1970, c. 193; 1980, c. 559; 1992, c. 132.",

As used in this section:\n\n\"Fund\" means the Strategic Compensation Grant Fund established pursuant to § 22.1-318.1.\n\n\"Grant\" means a grant issued pursuant to the Strategic Compensation Grant Initiative.\n\nB. The Department shall develop guidelines, consistent with this section, setting forth the general requirements of qualifying for a grant.\n\nC. Local school divisions may submit proposals to the Department to apply for a grant. Grants shall be awarded, on a competitive basis, for the purposes of awarding incentive payments to teachers. All proposals shall designate groups or types of teachers targeted for the incentives. Proposals may include plans to (i) reward teachers who help students make significant academic progress; (ii) incentivize team performance in schools achieving goals set by the school division; (iii) reward teachers assuming additional responsibilities, such as serving as a mentor to other teachers; (iv) pay incentives to effective teachers who have essential expertise and who are willing to transfer to positions at hard-to-staff or low-performing schools; (v) reward effective teachers who are assigned to teach critical shortage areas; or (vi) pay incentives to attract talented teachers with specified expertise in hard-to-staff positions. Any proposal that is designed to offer incentives for improved performance to an entire school team may include school leaders other than teachers.\n\nD. Each proposal shall outline a strategic compensation model used to disburse awarded funds. Stakeholder involvement is required in the development and implementation of the model. No individual shall receive more than $5,000 per year. The compensation model shall include measurable and appropriate achievement goals for student academic progress and plans for the professional development of the designated teachers. The compensation model may include tiers or a range of incentives.\n\nE. Any teacher awarded according to the terms of the proposal by the school division in its proposal shall (i) be licensed by the Board; (ii) be employed by the local school board under a contract; (iii) hold an endorsement in his subject area and grade level; (iv) be \"highly qualified,\" as that term is defined by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act, P.L. 89-10, as amended; (v) be evaluated using an effective system, consistent with the evaluations and criteria of the Board, including a weight of 40 percent on student academic progress for the summative rating; and (vi) be rated as \"proficient\" or better.\n\n2013, cc. 228, 691.",
