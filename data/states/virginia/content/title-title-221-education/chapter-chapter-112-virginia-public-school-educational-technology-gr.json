Funds may be disbursed to any school division that is eligible for financial assistance pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\n\nB. The State Treasurer shall manage the Virginia Public School Educational Technology Trust Fund, subject to the authority of the Board of Education to provide for its disbursement. The Fund shall be disbursed to award grants as provided in § 22.1-175.6.\n\nC. The amount of such educational technology grants shall be matched by funds of the qualifying school division based on the locality's composite index of ability to pay. In awarding such grants, the Board shall take into consideration any other state or federal grants which may have been applied for or awarded for the same projects. In addition, the Board shall assist local school divisions in applying for such grants and shall seek to ensure that all divisions have equitable access, based on superintendent's regions, to such funds as may be available.\n\n1999, c. 870.",
