Payments of interest and principal on such notes shall be made to the State Treasurer. Any loan from the Authority shall be repayable in installments as shall be approved by the local school board, as appropriate, with the final installment being due not more than thirty years after the date of such loan.

The Board of Commissioners may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or at private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority. The proceeds of such bonds shall be disbursed for the purposes for which such bonds were issued under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture provided for in § 22.1-171 may provide. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board of Commissioners may under like restrictions issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery.
