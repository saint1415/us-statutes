Facilitating the timely enrollment in school divisions of children of federal employees serving under orders pursuant to Title 22 or 50 of the United States Code and ensuring that such children are not placed at a disadvantage due to difficulty in the transfer of educational records from a local education agency in a sending state or a foreign education agency in a sending country or variations in entrance or age requirements between local education agencies in sending states or foreign education agencies in sending countries and school divisions in the Commonwealth;\n\n2. Facilitating the student placement process in school divisions through which children of federal employees serving under orders pursuant to Title 22 or 50 of the United States Code are not disadvantaged by variations in attendance requirements, scheduling, sequencing, grading, course content, or assessment between local education agencies in sending states or foreign education agencies in sending countries and school divisions in the Commonwealth;\n\n3. Facilitating the qualification and eligibility for enrollment, educational programs, and participation in extracurricular academic, athletic, and social activities in school divisions;\n\n4. Facilitating the on-time graduation in the Commonwealth of children of federal employees serving under orders pursuant to Title 22 or 50 of the United States Code; and\n\n5. Promoting flexibility and cooperation between local education agencies, parents, and students in order to achieve educational success for students.\n\n2023, c. 783; 2025, c. 445.",
