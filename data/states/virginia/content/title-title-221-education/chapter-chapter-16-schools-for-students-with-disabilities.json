Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by the Superintendent of Public Instruction or his designee.\n\nAfter such hearing, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the licensee may appeal the Superintendent of Public Instruction's decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following issuance of the order. The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Superintendent of Public Instruction had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.\n\nThe willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor.
