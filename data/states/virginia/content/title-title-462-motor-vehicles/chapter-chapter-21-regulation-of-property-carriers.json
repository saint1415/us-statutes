However, motor carriers exempt under subdivision 6 of § 46.2-2101 shall only be required to keep in force insurance, a bond, or bonds in the amount required by this section that provide primary coverage (i) when the motor carrier or person acting on behalf of the motor carrier is available to transport property for compensation and (ii) from the time the motor carrier or a person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier accepts the request to transport property and the vehicle is en route to pick up the property until the time the property has been removed from the vehicle and delivered to its final destination.\n\nB. The minimum public liability financial responsibility requirements for motor carriers operating in intrastate commerce shall be based on the gross vehicle weight rating of the vehicle as follows: for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000 pounds, the minimum requirement is $750,000; for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 7,500 pounds but not in excess of 10,000 pounds, the minimum requirement is $300,000; and for passenger cars, motorcycles, autocycles, and vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 7,500 pounds or less, the minimum requirement for clause (i) of subsection A is the financial responsibility requirements set forth in § 46.2-472 and for clause (ii) of subsection A is $100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident for death and bodily injury and at least $50,000 for property damage. The minimum insurance for motor carriers operating in interstate commerce shall equal the minimum required by federal law, rule, or regulation.\n\nC. Notwithstanding subsection B, the minimum public financial responsibility requirements for household goods carriers required to obtain a certificate of fitness pursuant to this chapter shall be $750,000.\n\nD.

The provisions of this section shall apply only to motor carriers exempt under subdivision 6 of § 46.2-2101 and insurance policies maintained by such carriers pursuant to this article.\n\nB. Insurance coverage for motor carriers shall be primary, and the requirements of § 46.2-2143.1 may be satisfied by any of the following:\n\n1. Insurance maintained by the motor carrier;\n\n2. Insurance maintained by another person on behalf of the motor carrier; or\n\n3. Any combination of subdivisions 1 and 2.\n\nC. A motor carrier may meet its obligation under subsection B of § 46.2-2143.1 through a policy obtained by a person other than the carrier under subdivision B 2 or 3 only if the motor carrier verifies that the policy is maintained by such other person.\n\nD. Insurers providing coverage under subsection B of § 46.2-2143.1 shall have the exclusive duty to defend any liability claim, including any claim against a motor carrier or person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier, arising from an accident occurring within the time period specified in subsection A of § 46.2-2143.1. Insurers of the personal automobile insurance policy of neither a person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier nor the vehicle's owner shall have the duty to defend or indemnify the activities of a person acting for or on behalf of a motor carrier in connection with the motor carrier unless such policy expressly provides otherwise for the period of time to which subsection A of § 46.2-2143.1 is applicable or the policy contains an amendment or endorsement to provide that coverage.\n\nE. Coverage under a motor carrier's insurance policy shall not be dependent on a personal automobile policy's first denying a claim, nor shall a personal automobile insurance policy be required to first deny a claim.\n\nF. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a personal automobile insurance policy to provide primary or excess coverage. The personal automobile insurance policy of neither a person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier nor the vehicle's owner shall provide coverage for activities in connection with the motor carrier to such person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier, the vehicle owner, or any third party unless such policy expressly provides otherwise for the period of time to which subsection A of § 46.2-2143.1 is applicable or the policy contains an amendment or endorsement to provide that coverage.\n\nG. In every instance where motor carrier insurance maintained by a person other than the motor carrier to fulfill the insurance obligations of subsection B of § 46.2-2143.1 has lapsed or ceased to exist, the motor carrier shall provide the coverage required by that subsection beginning with the first dollar of a claim.\n\nH. This section shall not limit the liability of a motor carrier arising out of an accident involving a person acting for or on behalf of the carrier in any action for damages against a motor carrier for an amount above the required insurance coverage.\n\nI. Any person, or an attorney acting on his behalf, who suffers a loss in an automobile accident with a reasonable belief that the accident involves a vehicle operated by a person acting for or on behalf of a motor carrier and who provides the motor carrier with the date, approximate time, and location of the accident, the name of the vehicle operator, if available, and the accident report, if available, may request in writing from the motor carrier information relating to the insurance coverage and the company providing the coverage. The motor carrier shall respond electronically or in writing within 30 days. The motor carrier's response shall contain the following information: (i) whether, at the approximate time of the accident, the vehicle was being operated for or on behalf of the motor carrier; (ii) the name of the insurance carrier providing primary coverage; and (iii) the identity and last known address of the vehicle operator.\n\nJ. Any insurance required by subsection B of § 46.2-2143.1 may be placed with an insurer that has been admitted in Virginia or with an insurer providing surplus lines insurance as defined in § 38.2-4805.2.\n\nK. Any insurance policy required by subsection B of § 46.2-2143.1 shall satisfy the financial responsibility requirement for a motor vehicle under § 46.2-706 during the period such vehicle is being operated for or on behalf of a motor carrier.\n\nL. If a vehicle operated by a person acting for or on behalf of a motor carrier is insured under a personal automobile insurance policy that does not exclude coverage, then such policy shall provide primary coverage and an insurance policy maintained by the motor carrier under § 46.2-2143.1 shall provide excess coverage up to at least the limits required by § 46.2-2143.1.\n\nM. In a claims coverage investigation, a motor carrier and its insurer shall cooperate with insurers involved in the claims coverage investigation to facilitate the exchange of information, including the date and time of any accident involving a vehicle operated for or on behalf of the motor carrier and the precise times that the vehicle was being operated for or on behalf of the motor carrier.\n\n2017, cc. 790, 815.",
