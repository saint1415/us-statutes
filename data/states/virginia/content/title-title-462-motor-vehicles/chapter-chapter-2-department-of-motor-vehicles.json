Any such agreement shall require, at a minimum, that the person to whom the Department is granting access agree to search the system only in compliance with the requirements of this section and to take appropriate measures to protect the credential holder's privacy.\n\nD. A person who has entered into an agreement with the Department to access and search the verification system, and who has been presented with an electronic credential or profile, may search the verification system to verify the validity and accuracy of the electronic credential or profile that has been presented if the electronic credential holder consents to the search.\n\nE. Following a search of the verification system made by a person with whom it has entered into an agreement pursuant to subsection C, the Department may release through the verification system a verification of those data fields that the electronic credential holder has consented to be verified.\n\n2017, c. 697.",

      "text": "A. The possession or display of an electronic credential shall not relieve a person from the requirements of any provision in the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Administrative Code, or a local ordinance or regulation requiring the possession or display of a physical credential.\n\nB. Any provision of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Administrative Code, or a local ordinance or regulation with a display requirement, which may be satisfied by the display or possession of a physical credential for which the Department may issue an electronic credential, may be satisfied by displaying or possessing an electronic credential issued pursuant to this article. Acceptance of an electronic credential shall be at the discretion of the person to whom it is presented and subject to the conditions of this section.\n\nC. If a person displays a profile, its display shall satisfy a display requirement if the profile provides sufficient data fields to satisfy the purpose for which it is being displayed.\n\nD. If the Department, or another agency responsible for enforcing a display requirement, requires that an electronic credential or profile be verified through the verification system prior to acceptance in certain circumstances, the display requirement shall be deemed satisfied by presentation of an electronic credential or profile in those circumstances only if the electronic credential or profile is verified by the verification system.\n\nE. The provisions of this section shall apply to the possession or display of similar electronic credentials or profiles issued by the government of another state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the United States, a foreign country, or a political subdivision of a foreign country to the extent that a physical credential from the same jurisdiction would satisfy the relevant display requirement.\n\n2017, c. 697.",
