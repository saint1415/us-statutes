The Commissioner shall work in consultation with the Medical Advisory Board for the Department to develop a definition of \"permanent disability\" as used in this subdivision. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, no physician's, podiatrist's, chiropractor's, advanced practice registered nurse's, or physician assistant's certification of an applicant's disability shall be required for the renewal of any disabled parking placard of an applicant to whom disabled parking license plates have been issued under § 46.2-731.\n\n2.

Any licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, podiatrist, or chiropractor who certifies an applicant's disability in advance of a medical procedure shall provide the period of time for which the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, podiatrist, or chiropractor has determined that the applicant will have the disability, not to exceed 12 months.

When there is no rearview mirror, the placard shall be displayed on the vehicle's dashboard.
