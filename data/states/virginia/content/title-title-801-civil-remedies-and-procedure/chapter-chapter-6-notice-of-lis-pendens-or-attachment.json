No lis pendens or attachment shall bind or affect a subsequent bona fide purchaser of real or personal estate for valuable consideration and without actual notice of such lis pendens or attachment, until and except from the time a memorandum setting forth the title of the cause or attachment, the general object thereof, the court wherein it is pending, the amount of the claim asserted by the plaintiff, a description of the property, the name of the person whose estate is intended to be affected thereby, and in an action to enforce a zoning ordinance a description of the alleged violation, shall be admitted to record in the clerk's office of the circuit court of the county or the city wherein the property is located; or if it be in that part of the City of Richmond lying north of the south bank of the James River and including the islands in such river, in the clerk's office of the Circuit Court, Division I, of such city, or if it be in the part of the City of Richmond lying south of the south bank of the James River, in the clerk's office of the Circuit Court, Division II, of such city. Clerks of circuit courts are authorized and directed to admit to record memoranda of lis pendens or attachment for actions pending in any court of this Commonwealth, or in any other state, federal, or territorial court.

Such memorandum shall not be deemed to have been recorded unless and until indexed as required by law. A memorandum of lis pendens admitted to record in an action to enforce a zoning ordinance shall expire after 180 days.\n\nB. No memorandum of lis pendens shall be filed unless the action on which the lis pendens is based seeks (i) to establish an interest by the filing party in the real property described in the memorandum, (ii) to sell the real property to enforce a lien for delinquent taxes pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 (§ 58.1-3965 et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1 or a docketed judgment lien, (iii) the partition of real property pursuant to Article 9 (§ 8.01-81 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01, or (iv) to enforce a zoning ordinance.\n\nCode 1950, § 8-142; 1973, c. 544; 1976, c. 178; 1977, c. 617; 1988, c. 503; 2008, cc. 60, 204; 2025, c. 267.",

      "text": "If such attachment or lis pendens is quashed or dismissed or such cause is dismissed, or judgment or final decree in such attachment or cause is for the defendant or defendants, the court shall direct in its order (i) that the names of all interested parties thereto, as found in the recorded attachment or lis pendens be listed for the clerk, and (ii) that the attachment or lis pendens be released and, the court may, in an appropriate case, impose sanctions as provided in § 8.01-271.1. It shall then become the duty of the clerk in whose office such attachment or lis pendens is recorded to record the order in the order book together with a separate instrument or order releasing such lien and referencing the deed book and page where the original lien is recorded. However, in any case in which an appeal or writ of error from such judgment or decree or dismissal would lie, the clerk shall not record the order or make the entry until after the expiration of the time in which such appeal or writ of error may be applied for, or if applied for after refusal thereof, or if granted, after final judgment or decree is entered by the appellate court.\n\nIn any case in which the debt for which such attachment is issued, or suit is brought and notice of lis pendens recorded is satisfied by payment, it shall be the duty of the creditor, within 10 days after payment of same, to provide the clerk with a separate instrument or order for recordation releasing such lis pendens and referencing the order book and page where the original lis pendens is recorded.\n\nCode 1950, § 8-143; 1962, c. 589; 1977, c. 617; 1985, c. 310; 1986, c. 278; 1989, c. 450; 2014, c. 330.",
