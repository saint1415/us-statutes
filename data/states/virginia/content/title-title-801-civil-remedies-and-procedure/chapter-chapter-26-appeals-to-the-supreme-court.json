Any person aggrieved by such order may, within 15 days of the entry of such order, file a petition for review with the Supreme Court in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 8.01-626.\n\nB.

The failure of a party to seek interlocutory review in accordance with this section shall not preclude review of the issue on appeal from a final order. An order by the Supreme Court denying interlocutory review in accordance with this section shall not preclude review of the issue on appeal from a final order, unless the order denying such interlocutory review provides for such preclusion.\n\n2023, c. 741.",
