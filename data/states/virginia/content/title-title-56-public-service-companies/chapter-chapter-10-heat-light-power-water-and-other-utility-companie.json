Shall mean and embrace every corporation (other than a municipality), company, individual, or association of individuals or cooperative, their lessees, trustees, or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that now or hereafter may own, manage or control any plant or equipment or any part of a plant or equipment within the Commonwealth for the conveyance of telephone messages or for the production, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of heat, chilled air, chilled water, light, power, or water, or sewerage facilities, either directly or indirectly, to or for the public.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of subdivision 1 of this subsection or subsection G of § 13.1-620, shall also include any governmental entity established pursuant to the laws of any other state, corporation (other than a municipality established under the laws of this Commonwealth), company, individual, or association of individuals or cooperative, their lessees, trustees, or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that at any time owns, manages or controls any plant or equipment, or any part thereof, located within the Commonwealth, which plant or equipment is used in the provision of sewage treatment services to or for an authority as defined in § 15.2-5101; however, the Commission shall have no jurisdiction to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of sewage treatment services that are provided by any such public utility directly to persons pursuant to the terms of a franchise agreement between the public utility and a municipality established under the laws of this Commonwealth.\n\n3. Except as provided in subdivision 2, shall not be construed to include any corporation created under the provisions of Title 13.1 unless the articles of incorporation expressly state that the corporation is to conduct business as a public service company.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall be deemed a public utility or public service company, solely by virtue of engaging in production, transmission, or sale at retail of electric power as a qualifying small power producer using renewable or nondepletable primary energy sources within the meaning of regulations adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in implementation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-617) and not exceeding 7.5 megawatts of rated capacity, nor solely by virtue of serving as an aggregator of the production of such small power producers, provided that the portion of the output of any qualifying small power producer which is sold at retail shall not be sold to residential consumers.\n\nC. No qualifying small power producer, within the meaning of regulations adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall be deemed a public utility within the meaning of Chapter 7 (§ 62.1-80 et seq.) of Title 62.1.\n\nD. The term \"public utility\" as herein defined shall not be construed to include any chilled water air-conditioning cooperative serving residences in less than a one square mile area, or any company that is excluded from the definition of \"public utility\" by subdivision (b)(4), (b)(8), (b)(9), or (b)(10) of § 56-265.1.\n\nE. Subject to the provisions of § 56-232.1, the term \"schedules\" as used in §§ 56-234 through 56-245 shall include schedules of rates and charges for service to the public and also contracts for rates and charges in sales at wholesale to other public utilities or for divisions of rates between public utilities, but shall not include contracts of telephone companies with the state government or contracts of other public utilities with municipal corporations or the federal or state government, or any contract executed prior to July 1, 1950.\n\nCode 1919, § 4067; 1918, p. 413; 1922, p. 887; 1942, p. 20; 1950, pp. 54, 481; 1954, c. 525; 1956, c. 436; 1964, c. 195; 1966, c. 620; 1975, c. 358; 1981, c. 385; 1984, c. 341; 1985, cc. 2, 41; 1990, c. 488; 1999, c. 419; 2000, cc. 528, 543; 2002, c. 813; 2003, c. 172; 2006, c. 411; 2009, c. 746.",

It shall be the duty of every public utility to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities at reasonable and just rates to any person, firm or corporation along its lines desiring same. Notwithstanding any other provision of law:\n\n1. A telephone company shall not have the duty to extend or expand its facilities to furnish service and facilities when the person, firm or corporation has service available from one or more alternative providers of wireline or terrestrial wireless communications services at prevailing market rates; and\n\n2. A telephone company may meet its duty to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities through the use of any and all available wireline and terrestrial wireless technologies; however, a telephone company, when restoring service to an existing wireline customer, shall offer the option to furnish service using wireline facilities.\n\nFor purposes of subdivisions 1 and 2, the Commission shall have the authority upon request of an individual, corporation, or other entity, or a telephone company, to determine whether the wireline or terrestrial wireless communications service available to the party requesting service is a reasonably adequate alternative to local exchange telephone service.\n\nThe use by a telephone company of wireline and terrestrial wireless technologies shall not be construed to grant any additional jurisdiction or authority to the Commission over such technologies.\n\nFor purposes of subdivision 1, \"prevailing market rates\" means rates similar to those generally available to consumers in competitive areas for the same services.\n\nB. It shall be the duty of every public utility to charge uniformly therefor all persons, corporations or municipal corporations using such service under like conditions. However, no provision of law shall be deemed to preclude voluntary rate or rate design tests or experiments, or other experiments involving the use of special rates, where such experiments have been approved by order of the Commission after notice and hearing and a finding that such experiments are necessary in order to acquire information which is or may be in furtherance of the public interest. The Commission's final order regarding any petition filed by an investor-owned electric utility for approval of a voluntary rate or rate design test or experiment shall be entered the earlier of not more than six months after the filing of the petition or not more than three months after the date of any evidentiary hearing concerning such petition. The charge for such service shall be at the lowest rate applicable for such service in accordance with schedules filed with the Commission pursuant to § 56-236. But, subject to the provisions of § 56-232.1, nothing contained herein or in § 56-481.1 shall apply to (i) schedules of rates for any telecommunications service provided to the public by virtue of any contract with, (ii) for any service provided under or relating to a contract for telecommunications services with, or (iii) contracts for service rendered by any telephone company to, the state government or any agency thereof, or by any other public utility to any municipal corporation or to the state or federal government. The provisions hereof shall not apply to or in any way affect any proceeding pending in the State Corporation Commission on or before July 1, 1950, and shall not confer on the Commission any jurisdiction not now vested in it with respect to any such proceeding.\n\nC. The Commission may conclude that competition can effectively ensure reasonably adequate retail services in competitive exchanges and may carry out its duty to ensure that a public utility is furnishing reasonably adequate retail service in its competitive exchanges by monitoring individual customer complaints and requiring appropriate responses to such complaints.\n\nD. An electric utility formed under or subject to Chapter 9.1 (§ 56-231.15 et seq.) may meet its duty to furnish reasonably adequate service through unregulated sales of electric power directly from one or more of its affiliates to any customer located within the cooperative's certificated service territory that contracts for electric utility services to serve a demand that is reasonably expected to exceed 90 megawatts.\n\nCode 1919, § 4066; 1918, p. 675; 1924, p. 540; 1927, p. 125; 1950, p. 55; 1964, c. 195; 1970, c. 258; 1976, c. 290; 1985, cc. 2, 41; 2002, c. 833; 2011, cc. 738, 740; 2018, c. 296; 2025, cc. 499, 598.",

The Commission, upon receipt of the petition, shall order that a public hearing be held to assist it in accumulating as much relevant data as possible in reaching its determination for the necessity of the proposed generation facility. The Commission shall review the petition, consider the testimony given at the public hearing, and determine whether the proposed improvements are necessary to enable the public utility to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities at reasonable and just rates. After making its determination, the Commission shall enter an order within nine months after the filing of such petition either approving or disapproving the proposed expenditure. Upon approval, the Commission shall set forth in its order terms and conditions it deems necessary for the efficient and proper construction of the generation facility.\n\nEvery electric utility capable of producing 100 megawatts or more of electric energy shall file with the Commission a projected forecast of its programs of operation, on such terms and for such time periods as directed by the Commission. Such a forecast shall include, but not be limited to, the anticipated required capacity to fulfill the requirements of the forecast, how the utility will achieve such capacity, the financial requirements for the period covered, the anticipated sources of those financial requirements, the research and development procedures, where appropriate, of new energy sources, and the budget for the research and development program.\n\nIn addition, the Commission shall investigate and monitor the major construction projects of any public utility to assure that such projects are being conducted in an economical, expeditious, and efficient manner.\n\nWhenever uneconomical, inefficient or wasteful practices, procedures, designs or planning are found to exist, the Commission shall have the authority to employ, at the sole expense of the utility, qualified persons, answerable solely to the Commission, who shall audit and investigate such practices, procedures, designs or planning and recommend to the Commission measures necessary to correct or eliminate such practices, procedures, designs or planning.\n\nConsistent with § 56-235.3, any public utility, electric or otherwise, seeking to pass through the cost of any capital project to its customers, shall have the burden of proving that such cost was incurred through reasonable, proper and efficient practices, and to the extent that such public utility fails to bear such burden of proof, such costs shall not be passed on to its customers in its rate base.\n\nThe Commission shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, or alter the utility's program in a manner consistent with the best interest of the citizens of the Commonwealth.

      "text": "A. Any rate, toll, charge or schedule of any public utility operating in this Commonwealth shall be considered to be just and reasonable only if: (1) the public utility has demonstrated that such rates, tolls, charges or schedules in the aggregate provide revenues not in excess of the aggregate actual costs incurred by the public utility in serving customers within the jurisdiction of the Commission, including such normalization for nonrecurring costs and annualized adjustments for future costs as the Commission finds reasonably can be predicted to occur during the rate year, and a fair return on the public utility's rate base used to serve those jurisdictional customers, which return shall be calculated in accordance with § 56-585.1 for utilities subject to such section; (1a) the investor-owned public electric utility has demonstrated that no part of such rates, tolls, charges or schedules includes costs for advertisement, except for advertisements either required by law or rule or regulation, or for advertisements which solely promote the public interest, conservation or more efficient use of energy; and (2) the public utility has demonstrated that such rates, tolls, charges or schedules contain reasonable classifications of customers. Notwithstanding § 56-234, the Commission may approve, either in the context of or apart from a rate proceeding after notice to all affected parties and hearing, special rates, contracts or incentives to individual customers or classes of customers where it finds such measures are in the public interest. Such special charges shall not be limited by the provisions of § 56-235.4. In determining costs of service, the Commission may use the test year method of estimating revenue needs. In any Commission order establishing a fair and reasonable rate of return for an investor-owned gas, telephone or electric public utility, the Commission shall set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which such order is based.\n\nFor ratemaking purposes, the Commission shall determine the federal and state income tax costs for investor-owned water, gas, or electric utility that is part of a publicly-traded, consolidated group as follows: (i) such utility's apportioned state income tax costs shall be calculated according to the applicable statutory rate, as if the utility had not filed a consolidated return with its affiliates, and (ii) such utility's federal income tax costs shall be calculated according to the applicable federal income tax rate and shall exclude any consolidated tax liability or benefit adjustments originating from any taxable income or loss of its affiliates.\n\nIn any ratemaking proceeding for an investor-owned utility authorized to furnish water or water and sewer service initiated after January 1, 2022, the Commission shall evaluate such utility on a stand-alone basis and, for purposes of establishing any revenue requirement and rates, utilize such utility's actual end-of-test period capital structure and cost of capital without regard to the cost of capital, capital structure, or investments of any other entities with which such utility may be affiliated, unless the Commission finds based on evidence in the record that the debt to equity ratio of the actual end-of-test period capital structure of such utility is unreasonable, in which case the Commission may utilize a debt to equity ratio that it finds to be reasonable. In all proceedings initiated after January 1, 2022, in which the Commission reviews the rates and associated earnings of an investor-owned utility authorized to furnish water or water and sewer service, the Commission shall conduct such review utilizing the same cost of capital and capital structure adopted in the utility's most recent rate case in which such rates were set, without regard to any later changes in the cost of capital or capital structure.\n\nB. The Commission shall, before approving special rates, contracts, incentives or other alternative regulatory plans under subsection A, ensure that such action (i) protects the public interest, (ii) will not unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any customer or class of customers, and (iii) will not jeopardize the continuation of reliable electric service.\n\nC. After notice and public hearing, the Commission shall issue guidelines for special rates adopted pursuant to subsection A that will ensure that other customers are not caused to bear increased rates as a result of such special rates.\n\n1977, c. 336; 1984, c. 312; 1996, c. 156; 2007, cc. 537, 888, 933; 2022, cc. 581, 582.",

In regulating telephone services of any telephone company, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Commission, after giving notice and an opportunity for hearing, may replace the ratemaking methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 with any alternative form of regulation which: (i) protects the affordability of basic local exchange telephone service, as such service is defined by the Commission; (ii) reasonably ensures the continuation of quality local exchange telephone service; (iii) will not unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any class of telephone company customers or other providers of competitive services; and (iv) is in the public interest. Alternatives may differ among telephone companies and may include, but are not limited to, the use of price regulation, ranges of authorized returns, categories of services, price indexing or other alternative forms of regulation. A hearing under this section shall include the right to present evidence and be heard. Prior to any hearing under this section, the Commission shall provide parties an opportunity to conduct discovery.\n\nC. Any telephone company or company regulated pursuant to Chapter 16 (§ 56-485 et seq.) or 19 (§ 56-531 et seq.) of this title may apply to the Commission at any time to obtain an alternative form of regulation. The Commission shall approve the application if it finds, after notice to all affected parties and hearing, that the proposal meets the standards for an alternative form of regulation set forth in subsection B.\n\n1. A Commission order, including appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law, denying or approving, with or without modification, an application for an alternative form of regulation shall be entered no more than 90 days from the filing of the application, except that the Commission, upon notice to all parties in interest, may extend that period in additional 30-day increments not to exceed an additional 90 days in all.\n\n2. If the Commission approves the application with modifications, the telephone company, or company regulated pursuant to Chapter 16 (§ 56-485 et seq.) or 19 (§ 56-531 et seq.) of this title, may, at its option, withdraw its application and continue to be regulated under the form of regulation that existed immediately prior to the filing of the application, unless it is modified for a telephone company by the Commission pursuant to subsection B.\n\nD. The Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, alter, amend or revoke any alternative form of regulation previously implemented if it finds that (i) the affordability of basic local exchange service, as such service is defined by the Commission, is threatened by the alternative form of regulation; (ii) the quality of local exchange telephone service has deteriorated or will deteriorate to the point that the public interest will not be served by continuation of the alternative form of regulation; (iii) the terms ordered by the Commission in connection with approval of a company's application for alternative form of regulation have been violated; (iv) any class of telephone company customers or other providers of competitive services are being unreasonably prejudiced or disadvantaged by the alternative form of regulation; or (v) the alternative form of regulation is no longer in the public interest.\n\nE. The Commission shall have the authority, after notice to all affected parties and an opportunity for hearing, to determine whether any telephone service of a telephone company is subject to competition and to provide, either by rule or case-by-case determination, for deregulation, detariffing, or modified regulation determined by the Commission to be in the public interest for such competitive services.\n\nF. The Commission may determine telephone services of any telephone company to be competitive when it finds competition or the potential for competition in the market place is or can be an effective regulator of the price of those services. Such determination may be made by the Commission on a statewide or a more limited geographic basis, such as one or more political subdivisions or one or more telephone exchange areas, or on the basis of a category of customers, such as business or residential customers, or customers exceeding a revenue or service quantity threshold, or some combination thereof. The Commission may also determine bundles composed of a combination of competitive and noncompetitive services to be competitive if the noncompetitive services are available separately pursuant to tariff or otherwise. In determining whether competition effectively regulates the prices of services, the Commission shall consider: (i) the ease of market entry, (ii) the presence of other providers reasonably meeting the needs of consumers, and (iii) other factors the Commission considers relevant. For purposes of this section, the Commission shall consider all wireless communications providers that offer voice communications services to be facilities-based competitors owning wireline network facilities and reasonably meeting the needs of consumers, regardless of whether such wireless providers own wireline network facilities. In its determination, the Commission shall not exclude as a competitor any affiliate of the telephone company. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, any telephone services that are the functional equivalent of the services offered individually or as part of a bundle of services by a county, city or town pursuant to § 56-265.4:4 or Article 5.1 (§ 56-484.7:1 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of this title, either directly or pursuant to a public-private partnership, shall be deemed competitive services in the geographic area where the services of the county, city or town are offered for purposes of this article and any alternate regulatory plans approved by the Commission.\n\nG. The Commission shall monitor the competitiveness of any telephone service previously found by it to be competitive under any provision of subsection F above and may change that conclusion, if, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, it finds that competition no longer effectively regulates the price of that service.\n\nH. Whenever the Commission adopts an alternative form of regulation pursuant to subsection B or C above, or determines that a service is competitive pursuant to subsections E and F above, the Commission shall adopt safeguards to protect consumers and competitive markets. At a minimum these safeguards must ensure that there is no cross subsidization of competitive services by monopoly services.\n\nI. If the Commission determines pursuant to subsections E and F that 75 percent or more of residential households or businesses in a telephone company's incumbent territory are in areas that have been determined by the Commission to be competitive for a telephone service, the Commission shall expand, for that telephone service throughout the company's incumbent territory, its competitive determination and apply the same regulatory treatment already adopted by the Commission for that telephone service in competitive areas, including any safeguards under subsection H.\n\nJ. If a telephone company provides 90 percent or more of its residential and business lines access to fiber optic or copper-based broadband service, as defined by the Federal Communications Commission, within an exchange area, the Commission shall expand, for basic and associated telephone services in that exchange area, its competitive determination and apply the same regulatory treatment already adopted by the Commission for those services in competitive areas, including any safeguards under subsection H.\n\n1993, c. 21; 1996, c. 18; 2002, cc. 479, 489; 2003, c. 711; 2009, c. 788.",

For the purposes of this section, \"performance-based ratemaking methodology\" shall mean a method of establishing rates and charges that are in the public interest, and that departs in whole or in part from the cost-of-service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2.\n\nB. The Commission shall approve such performance-based ratemaking methodology if it finds that it: (i) preserves adequate service to all classes of customers (including transportation-only customers if for a gas utility); (ii) does not unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any class of gas utility or electric utility customers; (iii) provides incentives for improved performance by the gas utility or electric utility in the conduct of its public duties; (iv) results in rates that are not excessive; and (v) is in the public interest. Performance-based forms of regulation may include, but not be limited to, fixed or capped base rates, the use of revenue indexing, price indexing, ranges of authorized return, gas cost indexing for gas utilities, and innovative utilization of utility-related assets and activities (such as a gas utility's off-system sales of excess gas supplies and release of upstream pipeline capacity, performance of billing services for other gas or electricity suppliers, and reduction or elimination of regulatory requirements) in ways that benefit both the utility and its customers and may include a mechanism for automatic annual adjustments to revenues or prices to reflect changes in any index adopted for the implementation of such performance-based form of regulation. In making the findings required by this subsection, the Commission shall include, but not be limited to, in its considerations: (i) any proposed measures, including investments in infrastructure, that are reasonably estimated to preserve or improve system reliability, safety, supply diversity, and gas utility transportation options; and (ii) other customer benefits that are reasonably estimated to accrue from the gas or electric utility's proposal.\n\nC. Each gas utility or electric utility shall have the option to apply for implementation of a performance-based form of regulation. If the Commission approves the application with modifications, the gas utility or electric utility may, at its option, withdraw its application and continue to be regulated under the form of regulation that existed immediately prior to the filing of the application.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to any retail supply choice pilot program in effect on July 1, 1999. The Commission shall accept such a plan for filing within thirty days of filing if it contains, at a minimum:\n\n1. A schedule for implementing retail supply choice for all of its customers;\n\n2. Tariff revisions, including proposed unbundled rates for firm and interruptible service (which may utilize a cost allocation and rate design formulated to recover the gas utility's nongas fixed costs on a nonvolumetric basis) and terms and conditions of service designed to provide nondiscriminatory open access over its transportation system, comparable to the transportation service provided by the gas utility to itself, to allow competitive suppliers to sell natural gas directly to the gas utility's customers. Any proposed unbundling rates shall include an explanation of the methodology used to develop the rates and a calculation of revenues, by customer class, thereby produced;\n\n3. Nonbypassable, competitively neutral annual surcharges for the gas utility to properly allocate and recover from its firm service customers not eligible for nonpilot transportation service under tariffs in effect on the effective date of this section, its nonmitigable costs associated with the provision of retail supply choice, including prudently incurred contract obligation costs and transition costs. For the purposes of this section, contract obligation costs are costs associated with acquiring, maintaining or terminating interstate and intrastate pipeline and storage capacity contracts, less revenues generated by mitigating such contract obligations, whether by off-system sales, capacity release, pipeline supplier refunds or otherwise; and transition costs are costs incurred by the gas utility associated with educating the public on retail supply choice and redesigning its facilities, operations and systems to permit retail supply choice;\n\n4. Tariff provisions to balance the receipts and deliveries of gas supplies to retail supply choice customers and allocate the gas utility's gas costs so that one class of customers is not subsidized by another class of customers;\n\n5. Tariff provisions requiring the gas utility, at a minimum, to offer gas suppliers or retail supply choice customers the right to acquire the gas utility's upstream transmission and/or storage capacity in a manner that assures that one class of customers is not subsidized by another class of customers, provided that nothing contained herein shall deny the gas utility the right to request Commission approval of such tariff provisions as are designed to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to firm service customers on its system, including provisions requiring gas suppliers to accept assignment of upstream transportation and storage capacity, and/or allowing the gas utility to retain a portion of its upstream transportation and storage capacity to ensure safe and reliable natural gas service to its customers;\n\n6. A code of conduct governing the activities and relationships between the gas utility and gas suppliers to prevent anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct and the unlawful exercise of market power. Such codes of conduct shall incorporate or be consistent with any rule or guideline established by the Commission; and\n\n7. Any other requirement established by Commission rule or regulation.\n\nThe Commission may, by rule or regulation, impose such additional filing requirements as it deems necessary in the public interest. The Commission may also require a gas utility to continue to serve as a gas supplier to its customers after the gas utility's plan becomes effective and under such terms and conditions as are necessary to protect the public interest.\n\nB. After the Commission has accepted a filing as provided in subsection A, the Commission shall review and approve a plan filed by a gas utility unless it determines, after notice and an opportunity for public hearing, that the plan would:\n\n1. Adversely affect the quality, safety, or reliability of natural gas service by the gas utility or the provision of adequate service to the gas utility's customers;\n\n2. Result in rates charged by the gas utility that are not just and reasonable rates within the contemplation of § 56-235.2 or that are in excess of levels approved by the Commission under § 56-235.6, as the case may be;\n\n3. Adversely affect the gas utility's customers not participating in the retail supply choice plan;\n\n4. Unreasonably discriminate against one class of the gas utility's customers in favor of another class (provided, however, that a gas utility's recovery of nongas fixed costs on a nonvolumetric basis shall not necessarily constitute unreasonable discrimination); or\n\n5. Not be in the public interest.\n\nThe Commission shall, after the acceptance of a filing of a retail supply choice plan, approve or disapprove the plan within 120 days. The 120-day period may be extended by Commission order for an additional period not to exceed sixty days. The retail supply choice plan shall be deemed approved if the Commission fails to act within 120 days or any extended period ordered by the Commission. The Commission shall approve a retail supply choice plan filed by a gas utility pursuant to this subsection regardless of whether it has promulgated rules and regulations pursuant to subsection A. The Commission may also modify a plan filed by a gas utility to ensure that it conforms to the provisions of this subsection and is otherwise in the public interest. Plans approved pursuant to this section shall not be placed into effect before July 1, 2000.\n\nC. The Commission may, on its own motion, direct a gas utility to file a retail supply choice plan, which shall comply with subsection A, shall include such other details in the plan as the Commission may require, and does not cause the effects set forth in subsection B, or the Commission may, on its own motion, propose a plan for a gas utility for retail supply choice that complies with the requirements of subsection A and does not cause the effects set forth in subsection B. The Commission may approve any plans under this subsection after notice to all affected parties and an opportunity for hearing.\n\nD. Once a plan becomes effective pursuant to this section, if the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the plan is causing, or is reasonably likely to cause, the effects set forth in subsection B, it may order revisions to the plan to remove such effects. Any such revisions to the plan will operate prospectively only.\n\nE. If, upon application of at least twenty-five percent of retail supply choice customers or of 500 retail choice customers, whichever number is lesser, or by the gas utility, it is alleged that the marketplace for retail supply choice customer is not reasonably competitive or results in rates unreasonably in excess of what would otherwise be charged by the gas utility, or if the Commission renders such a determination upon its own motion, then the Commission may, after notice, and opportunity for hearing, terminate the gas utility's retail supply choice program and provide for an orderly return of the retail choice customers to the gas utility's traditional retail natural gas sales service. In such event, the gas utility shall be given the opportunity to acquire, under reasonable and competitive terms and conditions and within a reasonable time period, such upstream transportation and storage capacity as is necessary for it to provide traditional retail natural gas sales service to former retail supply choice customers.\n\nF. Licensure of gas suppliers.\n\n1. No person, other than a gas utility, shall engage in the business of selling natural gas to the residential and small commercial customers of a gas utility that has an approved plan implementing retail supply choice unless such person (for the purpose of this section, gas supplier) holds a license issued by the Commission. An application for a gas supplier license must be made to the Commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the Commission may, by rule or regulation, require. For purposes of this subsection, the Commission shall require a gas supplier to demonstrate that it has the means to provide natural gas to essential human needs customers. A gas supplier license shall be issued to any qualified applicant within forty-five days of the date of filing such application, authorizing in whole or in part the service covered by the application, unless the Commission determines otherwise for good cause shown. A person holding such a license shall not be considered a \"public service corporation,\" \"public service company\" or a \"public utility\" and shall not be subject to regulation as such; however, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the liability of such a person for any license tax levied pursuant to Article 2 (§ 58.1-2620 et seq.) of Chapter 26 of Title 58.1. No license issued under this chapter shall be transferred without prior Commission approval finding that such transfer is not inconsistent with the public interest. If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that a gas supplier has failed to comply with the provisions of this subsection or the Commission's rules, regulations or orders, the Commission may enjoin, fine, or punish any such failure pursuant to the Commission's authority under this statute and under Title 12.1 of the Code of Virginia. The Commission may also suspend or revoke the gas supplier's license or take such other action as is necessary to protect the public interest.\n\n2. The Commission shall establish rules and regulations for the implementation of this subsection, provided that:\n\na. The Commission's rules and regulations shall not govern the rates charged by licensed gas suppliers, except that the Commission's rules and regulations may govern the terms and conditions of service of licensed gas suppliers to protect the gas utility's customers from commercially unreasonable terms and conditions; and\n\nb. The Commission's rules and regulations shall permit an affiliate of the gas utility to be licensed as a gas supplier and to participate in the gas utility's retail supply choice program under the same terms and conditions as gas suppliers not affiliated with the gas utility.\n\n3. The Commission shall also have the authority to issue rules and regulations governing the marketing practices of gas suppliers.\n\nG. Retail customers' private right of action; marketing practices.\n\n1. No gas supplier shall use any deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, or any deceptive or unfair practices in providing or marketing gas service.\n\n2. Any person who suffers loss (i) as the result of fraudulent marketing practices, including telemarketing practices, engaged in by any gas supplier providing any service made competitive under this section, or of any violation of rules and regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to subdivision F 3, or (ii) as the result of any violation of subdivision 1 of this subsection, shall be entitled to initiate an action to recover actual damages, or $500, whichever is greater. If the trier of fact finds that the violation was willful, it may increase damages to an amount not exceeding three times the actual damages sustained, or $1,000, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, in addition to any damages awarded, such person also may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.\n\n3. The Attorney General, the attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for the city, county or town may cause an action to be brought in the appropriate circuit court for relief of violations referenced in subdivision 2 of this subsection.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in addition to any damages awarded, such person or governmental agency initiating an action pursuant to this section may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.\n\n5. Any action pursuant to this subsection shall be commenced by persons other than the Commission within two years after its accrual. The cause of action shall accrue as provided in § 8.01-230. However, if the Commission initiates proceedings, or any other governmental agency files suit for violations under this section, the time during which such proceeding or governmental suit and all appeals therefrom are pending shall not be counted as any part of the period within which an action under this section shall be brought.\n\n6. The circuit court may make such additional orders or decrees as may be necessary to restore to any identifiable person any money or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, which may have been acquired from such person by means of any act or practice violative of this subsection, provided that such person shall be identified by order of the court within 180 days from the date of any order permanently enjoining the unlawful act or practice.\n\n7. In any case arising under this subsection, no liability shall be imposed upon any gas supplier who shows by a preponderance of the evidence that (i) the act or practice alleged to be in violation of subdivision 1 of this subsection was an act or practice over which the same had no control or (ii) the alleged violation resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid a violation. However, nothing in this section shall prevent the court from ordering restitution and payment of reasonable attorney's fees and court costs pursuant to subdivision 4 of this subsection to individuals aggrieved as a result of an unintentional violation of this subsection.\n\nH. Authorized public utilities shall file with the Commission tariff revisions reflecting the net effect of the elimination of taxes pursuant to subsection B of § 58.1-2904 and the addition of state income taxes pursuant to § 58.1-400. Such tariffs shall be effective for service rendered on and after January 1, 2001, and shall be filed at least forty-five days prior to the effective date. Such filing shall not constitute a rate increase for the purposes of § 56-235.4.\n\nI. Consumer education.\n\n1. The Commission shall develop a consumer education program designed to provide the following information to retail customers concerning retail supply choice for natural gas customers:\n\na. Opportunities and options in choosing natural gas suppliers;\n\nb. Marketing and billing information gas suppliers will be required to furnish retail customers;\n\nc. Retail customers' rights and obligations concerning the purchase of natural gas and related services; and\n\nd. Such other information as the Commission may deem necessary and appropriate and in the public interest.\n\n2. The consumer education program authorized herein may be conducted in conjunction with the program provided for in § 56-592.\n\n3. The Commission shall establish or maintain a complaint bureau for the purpose of receiving, reviewing and investigating complaints by retail customers against gas utilities, public service companies, licensed suppliers and other providers of any services affected by this section. Upon the request of any interested person or the Attorney General, or upon its own motion, the Commission shall be authorized to inquire into possible violations of § 56-235.8 and to enjoin or punish any violations thereof pursuant to its authority under § 56-235.8, this title, or Title 12.1. The Attorney General shall have a right to participate in such proceedings consistent with the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\n4. For all billing statements sent on and after August 1, 2000, all gas utilities, as defined in subsection A, shall enclose the following information in all billing statements for retail natural gas service:\n\na. Gas utilities shall separately state an approximate amount of the tax imposed under §§ 58.1-2626, 58.1-2660 and 58.1-3731 which is included in the customer's bill until such tax is no longer imposed; and\n\nb. For all such billing statements, a statement which reads as follows shall be included: \"Beginning January 1, 2001, the current state and local gross receipts taxes on sales of natural gas will be replaced by a tax based on the consumption of natural gas by consumers. In the past, the current gross receipts tax has always been included in the rate charged for natural gas. Now, this tax is being separately stated. The total gross receipts tax imposed by Virginia and the localities is approximately two percent of the amount charged to consumers. The new state and local consumption tax will be charged at an approximate rate of $0.02 per 100 cubic feet (CCF) of natural gas consumed. While this rate was designed to be less than, or equal to, the effect of the current gross receipts tax which is being replaced, the tax you pay may actually be higher in your locality. This statement is being provided for your information.\"\n\n1999, c. 494; 2000, cc. 691, 706.",

The natural gas utility shall maintain the burden of demonstrating that the eligible safety activity costs have been reasonably and prudently incurred and that the criteria of this section have been satisfied.\n\nC. A natural gas utility may account for eligible safety activity costs to be recovered pursuant to this section as deferred costs. The accumulated unrecovered balance of eligible safety activity costs deferred pursuant to this section shall not exceed four percent of the natural gas utility's net plant investment that was utilized in establishing or confirming base rates in the natural gas utility's most recent rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6.

The Partnership is authorized to certify that an industrial site is a qualified economic development site if it finds that:\n\n1. The person with legal authority to develop the site is authorized to contract for the extension of utility service to the site;\n\n2. The development of the site is compliant with applicable zoning requirements and is consistent with the locality's comprehensive plan;\n\n3.

A proposal for approval of a Program shall include an analysis of how acquiring utility rights-of-way will enhance the Commonwealth's infrastructure and promote the Commonwealth's competitive business environment by improving the readiness of a qualified economic development site.\n\nD. The Commission shall approve, or approve with appropriate modifications, a Program if it finds that:\n\n1. The implementation of the Program will provide material economic development benefits that might not otherwise be attained absent the Commission's approval of the Program;\n\n2. The Program proposes a rate mechanism, including base rates or a rate adjustment clause, that authorizes the utility to recover its costs incurred in implementing the Program until such time as the investment is placed in service;\n\n3. The proposal to acquire utility rights-of-way would not otherwise be immediately supported by expected revenues from new loads served under the Program at the qualified economic development site;\n\n4.

The associated charges resulting from implementation of the Program will apply only to firm service customers;\n\n6. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership has certified pursuant to subsection B that the site for which the utility proposes to acquire utility rights-of-way under the Program is a qualified economic development site;\n\n7. The Program is designed only to acquire utility rights-of-way to a qualified economic development site and not to provide service to other customers or potential customers;\n\n8. The utility's assumptions regarding costs to acquire utility rights-of-way under the Program are not unduly speculative; and\n\n9. The Program is not otherwise contrary to the public interest.\n\nE. After Commission review and absent action by the Commission to the contrary, the Program shall take effect 120 days following the date on which the proposal for the Program was filed. Any amendment to a Program following its implementation shall be submitted to the Commission at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date thereof and, absent action by the Commission to the contrary, the amendment shall become effective on such date.\n\nF. The Commission's approval of a Program shall authorize the utility to:\n\n1. Acquire utility rights-of-way for the ordinary extension of utility facilities in the normal course of business to one or more qualified economic development sites; and\n\n2. Recover costs incurred in implementing the Program, including costs deferred and associated carrying costs, from the time incurred until the time the Commission establishes new rates that include recovery of such deferred costs.\n\nG. A utility, in implementing a Program, shall in good faith coordinate the acquisition of rights-of-way with communications providers and other utilities, including water, sewer, electric, or natural gas utilities, so that any facilities ultimately to be constructed may be collocated to the extent feasible.\n\nH. In calculating the utility's return on the investment with regard to costs incurred in implementing a Program, the Commission shall use the utility's regulatory capital structure, including the cost of equity most recently approved by the Commission. If the utility's cost of capital at the time its Economic Development Program is filed has not been changed by order of the Commission within the preceding five years, the Commission may require the utility to file an updated weighted average cost of capital, and the utility may propose an updated weighted average cost of capital.\n\nI.

Permit a Program to include conversion of existing retail propane customers to electric or natural gas; or\n\n4. Prohibit an electric utility from recovering its transmission-related costs incurred in implementing the Program through a rate adjustment clause pursuant to subdivision A 4 of § 56-585.1.\n\nJ.

Every public utility shall provide its residential customers one full billing period to pay for one month's local or basic services, before initiating any proceeding against a residential customer for nonpayment of local service.\n\n2. Pay the residential customer a fair rate of interest as determined by the Commission on money deposited and return the deposit with the interest after not more than one year of satisfactory credit has been established.\n\n3. Every public utility shall establish customer complaint procedures that will ensure prompt and effective handling of all customer inquiries, service requests, and complaints. Such procedure shall be approved by the Commission before its implementation and it shall be distributed to its residential customers. The utility shall disclose to the customer that the Commission is the responsible regulatory agency and that the customer may contact the Commission on regulatory matters and provide the customer with the contact information for the Commission.\n\n4. No electric or gas utility shall terminate a customer's service without 10 days' notice by mail to the customer.\n\n5. No public utility shall terminate the residential service of a customer for such customer's nonpayment of basic nonresidential services as defined by its terms and conditions on file with the Virginia State Corporation Commission.\n\n6. A public utility providing water service shall not terminate service for nonpayment until it first sends the customer written notice by mail 10 days in advance of making the termination but, in no event, shall it terminate the customer's service until 20 days after the customer's bill has become due. Any such notice shall also include contact information for the customer's use in contacting the public utility regarding the notice.\n\n7. Any electric utility formed under or subject to Chapter 9.1 (§ 56-231.15 et seq.) may install and operate, upon a customer's request and pursuant to an appropriate tariff for any type or classification of service, a prepaid metering equipment and system that is configured to terminate electric service immediately and automatically when the customer has incurred charges for electric service equal to the customer's prepayments for such service. Subdivisions 1, 2, 4, and 5 shall not apply to services provided pursuant to electric service provided on a prepaid basis by a prepaid metering equipment and system pursuant to this subsection. Such tariffs shall be filed with the Commission for its review and determination that the tariff is not contrary to the public interest.\n\n8. No electric utility shall terminate the residential service of a customer for such customer's nonpayment for metered services when the electric utility believes that the customer is receiving or has received electric utility services for which the customer was not properly billed as the result of tampering with the electric utility's meter in a manner that prevented the meter from accurately recording usage, until the electric utility has complied with the procedure set forth in subsection C. However, the requirement that the electric utility comply with the procedure set forth in subsection C before terminating service shall not apply if (i) the condition of a customer's wiring, equipment, or appliances is either unsafe or unsuitable for receiving the electric utility service; (ii) the customer's use of the electric utility service or equipment interferes with or may be detrimental to the electric utility's facilities or to the provision of electric utility service by the electric utility to any other customer; (iii) a tamper-evident meter seal securing the meter is broken, damaged, or missing; (iv) electric service is furnished over a line that is not owned or leased by the electric utility and the line is either not in a safe and suitable condition or is inadequate to receive electric utility service; (v) emergency repairs or alterations are needed; (vi) there are unavoidable shortages or interruptions in a supply of utility service; (vii) the electric utility is acting upon orders from an authority having jurisdiction; or (viii) the actions taken are to preserve life or property, or to avoid or abate utility or fire hazard.\n\nB. Any and all Commission rules and regulations concerning the denial of telephone service for nonpayment of such service shall not apply to services found to be competitive.\n\nC. If an electric utility believes that a customer is receiving or has received electric utility services for which the customer was not properly billed as the result of tampering with the electric utility's meter in a manner that prevented the meter from accurately recording usage, the electric utility shall (i) retrieve the meter from the customer's premises, which may be done without providing prior notice to the customer; (ii) immediately replace it with a new meter; and (iii) determine whether the meter has been tampered with. Within 60 days after any such determination of meter tampering has been made, the electric utility shall provide evidence of such tampering to the customer. If, after determining the meter has been tampered with, the electric utility seeks payment for electric utility services not properly billed, the electric utility shall provide the customer with an invoice with a reasonable and final estimate of the amount owed by the customer as a result of the meter's failure to accurately record the customer's usage. The invoice shall explain the electric utility's calculation of the estimated amount owed as a result of any suspected failure. The electric utility shall provide the customer one full billing period to pay the amount billed in such invoice before initiating any proceeding against the customer for nonpayment. During such billing period, the customer may submit an informal complaint to the Commission disputing the amount sought by the utility. The customer may commence a formal proceeding after the informal complaint process has been exhausted in accordance with Commission regulations.\n\n1976, c. 738; 1977, c. 59; 1980, c. 415; 2010, c. 320; 2011, cc. 500, 738, 740; 2020, c. 668.",

Upon investigation of such estimates and hearings in accordance with law, the Commission shall direct each company to place in effect tariff provisions designed to recover the fuel costs determined by the Commission to be appropriate for that period, adjusted for any over-recovery or under-recovery of fuel costs previously incurred.\n\n2. The Commission shall continuously review fuel costs and if it finds that any utility described in subdivision A 1 is in an over-recovery position by more than five percent, or likely to be so, it may reduce the fuel cost tariffs to correct the over-recovery.\n\n3. Beginning July 1, 2009, for all utilities described in subdivision A 1 and subsection B, if the Commission approves any increase in fuel factor charges pursuant to this section that would increase the total rates of the residential class of customers of any such utility by more than 20 percent, the Commission, within six months following the effective date of such increase, shall review fuel costs, and if the Commission finds that the utility is, or is likely to be, in an over-recovery position with respect to fuel costs for the 12-month period for which the increase in fuel factor charges was approved by more than five percent, it may reduce the utility's fuel cost tariffs to correct the over-recovery.\n\nB. All fuel costs recovery tariff provisions in effect on January 1, 2004, for any electric utility that purchases fuel for the generation of electricity and that was, as of July 1, 1999, bound by a rate case settlement adopted by the Commission that extended in its application beyond January 1, 2002, shall remain in effect until the later of (i) July 1, 2007 or (ii) the establishment of tariff provisions under subsection C. Any such utility shall continue to report to the Commission annually its actual fuel costs, including the cost of purchased power.\n\nC. Each electric utility described in subsection B shall submit annually to the Commission its estimate of fuel costs, including the cost of purchased power, for successive 12-month periods beginning on July 1, 2007, and each July 1 thereafter. Upon investigation of such estimates and hearings in accordance with law, the Commission shall direct each such utility to place in effect tariff provisions designed to recover the fuel costs determined by the Commission to be appropriate for such periods, adjusted for any over-recovery or under-recovery of fuel costs previously incurred; however, (i) no such adjustment for any over-recovery or under-recovery of fuel costs previously incurred shall be made for any period prior to July 1, 2007, and (ii) the Commission shall order that the deferral portion, if any, of the total increase in fuel tariffs for all classes as determined by the Commission to be appropriate for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2007, above the fuel tariffs previously existing, shall be deferred without interest and recovered from all classes of customers as follows: (i) in the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2008, that part of the deferral portion of the increase in fuel tariffs that the Commission determines would increase the total rates of the residential class of customers of the utility by four percent over the level of such total rates in existence on June 30, 2008, shall be recovered; (ii) in the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2009, that part of the balance of the deferral portion of the increase in fuel tariffs, if any, that the Commission determines would increase the total rates of the residential class of customers of the utility by four percent over the level of such total rates in existence on June 30, 2009, shall be recovered; and (iii) in the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2010, the entire balance of the deferral portion of the increase in fuel tariffs, if any, shall be recovered. The \"deferral portion of the increase in fuel tariffs\" means the portion of such increase in fuel tariffs that exceeds the amount of such increase in fuel tariffs that the Commission determines would increase the total rates of the residential class of customers of the utility by more than four percent over the level of such total rates in existence on June 30, 2007.\n\nD. In proceedings under subsections A and C:\n\n1. Energy revenues associated with off-system sales of power shall be credited against fuel factor expenses in an amount equal to the total incremental fuel factor costs incurred in the production and delivery of such sales. In addition, 75 percent of the total annual margins from off-system sales shall be credited against fuel factor expenses; however, the Commission, upon application and after notice and opportunity for hearing, may require that a smaller percentage of such margins be so credited if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that such requirement is in the public interest. The remaining margins from off-system sales shall not be considered in the biennial reviews of electric utilities conducted pursuant to § 56-585.1. In the event such margins result in a net loss to the electric utility, (i) no charges shall be applied to fuel factor expenses and (ii) any such net losses shall not be considered in the biennial reviews of electric utilities conducted pursuant to § 56-585.1. For purposes of this subsection, \"margins from off-system sales\" shall mean the total revenues received from off-system sales transactions less the total incremental costs incurred; and\n\n2. The Commission shall disallow recovery of any fuel costs that it finds without just cause to be the result of failure of the utility to make every reasonable effort to minimize fuel costs or any decision of the utility resulting in unreasonable fuel costs, giving due regard to reliability of service and the need to maintain reliable sources of supply, economical generation mix, generating experience of comparable facilities, and minimization of the total cost of providing service.\n\nIn any proceeding for the recovery of fuel costs under this subdivision in which the costs a utility seeks to recover include costs incurred under a natural gas capacity contract for a term of more than 10 years that procures more than 250,000 dekatherms per day that has not previously been subject to a review under this subdivision, the Commission shall require the utility to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the utility has (i) determined that the utility cannot meet its service obligations, giving due regard, in the Commission's sole discretion, to reliability of service and the need to maintain reliable sources of supply, without an additional fuel resource; (ii) reasonably identified and determined the date and amount of the new fuel resource it needs; (iii) objectively studied available alternative fuel resource options, as verified by the Commission, including options other than a new natural gas capacity contract or contracts to meet the identified and determined need; and (iv) determined that the natural gas capacity contract or contracts are the lowest-cost available option, taking into consideration fixed and variable costs and a reasonable projection of utilization. Absent the Commission's finding that the utility has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the utility had complied with the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), the Commission shall deny the utility's recovery of such costs. Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the Commission's discretion to review and make a determination as to the reasonableness of the recovery by a utility of costs, including costs incurred under a natural gas capacity contract, that were previously subject to a review under this subdivision.\n\nE. The Commission is authorized to promulgate, in accordance with the provisions of this section, all rules and regulations necessary to allow the recovery by electric utilities of all of their prudently incurred fuel costs under subsections A and C, including the cost of purchased power, as precisely and promptly as possible, with no over-recovery or under-recovery, except as provided in subsection C, in a manner that will tend to assure public confidence and minimize abrupt changes in charges to consumers.\n\n1978, c. 636; 1979, c. 492; 1980, c. 384; 1982, c. 584; 1984, cc. 716, 725; 1989, c. 666; 2004, c. 827; 2006, c. 939; 2007, cc. 888, 933; 2009, c. 244; 2020, c. 661.",

      "text": "A. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 56-249.6 or Chapter 3 (§ 56-55 et seq.), an electric utility may petition the Commission for a financing order and the Commission shall either issue (i) such financing order or (ii) an order rejecting the petition, no more than four months from the date of filing such petition and in accordance with the requirements of subdivision 2.\n\n1. The petition shall include (i) an estimate of the total amount of deferred fuel costs that the electric utility has incurred over the time period noted in the petition; (ii) an indication of whether the electric utility proposes to finance all or a portion of the deferred fuel costs using one or more series or tranches of deferred fuel cost bonds; (iii) an estimate and details of the financing costs related to the deferred fuel costs to be financed through the deferred fuel cost bonds; (iv) an estimate of the deferred fuel cost charges necessary to recover the deferred fuel costs and all financing costs and the proposed period for recovery of such costs; (v) a description of any benefits expected to result from the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds, including the avoidance of or significant mitigation of abrupt and significant increases in rates to the electric utility's customers for the applicable time period; and (vi) direct testimony and exhibits supporting the petition. If the electric utility proposes to finance a portion of the deferred fuel costs, the electric utility shall identify in the petition the specific amount of deferred fuel costs for the applicable time period to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds. By electing not to finance a portion of the deferred fuel costs for an applicable time period using deferred fuel cost bonds, an electric utility shall not be deemed to waive its right to recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the Commission.\n\n2. a. If an electric utility petitions the Commission for a financing order pursuant to this section, following notice and an opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall either issue (i) a financing order or (ii) an order rejecting the petition, not more than four months from the date of filing such petition.\n\nb. A financing order issued by the Commission pursuant to this section shall include:\n\n(1) The amount of deferred fuel costs to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds. The Commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may be recovered through deferred fuel cost charges. The financing order shall also specify the period over which deferred fuel costs and financing costs may be recovered and whether the deferred fuel cost bonds may be offered and issued in one or more series or tranches during a fixed period not to exceed one year after the date of the financing order;\n\n(2) A finding that the proposed issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds is in the public interest and the associated deferred fuel cost charges are just and reasonable;\n\n(3) A finding that the structuring and pricing of the deferred fuel cost bonds are reasonably expected to result in reasonable deferred fuel cost charges consistent with market conditions at the time the deferred fuel cost bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order;\n\n(4) A requirement that, for so long as the deferred fuel cost bonds are outstanding and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of deferred fuel cost charges authorized under a financing order shall be non-bypassable and paid by all retail customers of the electric utility, irrespective of the generation supplier of such customer, except for an exempt retail access customer;\n\n(5) A formula-based true-up mechanism for making annual adjustments to the deferred fuel cost charges that customers are required to pay pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of deferred fuel cost bonds and financing costs and other required amounts and charges payable in connection with the deferred fuel cost bonds;\n\n(6) The deferred fuel cost property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an electric utility or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure deferred fuel cost bonds and all financing costs;\n\n(7) The authority of the electric utility to establish the terms and conditions of the deferred fuel cost bonds, including repayment schedules, expected interest rates, the issuance in one or more series or tranches with different maturity dates, and other financing costs;\n\n(8) A finding that the deferred fuel cost charges shall be allocated among customer classes in accordance with the methodology approved in the electric utility's last fuel factor proceeding;\n\n(9) A requirement that after the final terms of an issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds have been established and before the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds, the electric utility determines the resulting initial deferred fuel cost charge in accordance with the financing order and that such initial deferred fuel cost charge be final and effective upon the issuance of such deferred fuel cost bonds without further Commission action so long as such initial deferred fuel cost charge is consistent with the financing order;\n\n(10) A method of tracing funds collected as deferred fuel cost charges, or other proceeds of deferred fuel cost property, and a requirement that such method be the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any deferred fuel cost property subject to the financing order under applicable law; and\n\n(11) Any other conditions not otherwise inconsistent with this section that the Commission determines are appropriate.\n\nc. A financing order issued to an electric utility may provide that creation of the electric utility's deferred fuel cost property is conditioned upon, and simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer for the deferred fuel cost property to an assignee and the pledge of the deferred fuel cost property to secure deferred fuel cost bonds.\n\nd. If the Commission issues a financing order, the Commission shall establish a protocol for the electric utility to annually file a petition or, in the Commission's discretion, a letter setting out application of the formula-based mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make applicable adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are any mathematical or clerical errors in the application of the formula-based mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of deferred fuel cost charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in respect of deferred fuel cost bonds approved under the financing order. Within 30 days after receiving an electric utility's request pursuant to this subdivision d, the Commission shall either approve the request or inform the electric utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the Commission informs the electric utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the electric utility may correct its error and refile its request. The time frames previously described in this subdivision d shall apply to a refiled request.\n\ne. Subsequent to the transfer of deferred fuel cost property to an assignee or the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds authorized thereby, whichever is earlier, a financing order shall be irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based mechanism authorized in this section, the Commission shall not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust deferred fuel cost charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer deferred fuel cost property or to cause deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance.\n\n3. At the request of an electric utility, the Commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or refunding deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the Commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in this section for a financing order. Effective upon retirement of the refunded deferred fuel cost bonds and the issuance of new deferred fuel cost bonds, the Commission shall adjust the related deferred fuel cost charges accordingly.\n\n4. a. A financing order shall remain in effect and deferred fuel cost property under the financing order shall continue to exist until deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all Commission-approved financing costs of such deferred fuel cost bonds have been recovered in full.\n\nb. A financing order issued to an electric utility shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, merger, or sale of the electric utility or its successors or assignees.\n\nB. 1. The Commission shall not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties regarding any matter within its authority pursuant to this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, consider the deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to a financing order to be the debt of the electric utility other than for federal income tax purposes, consider the deferred fuel cost charges paid under the financing order to be the revenue of the electric utility for any purpose, or consider the deferred fuel costs or financing costs specified in the financing order to be the costs of the electric utility, nor shall the Commission determine any action taken by an electric utility that is consistent with the financing order to be unjust or unreasonable.\n\n2. The Commission shall not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electric utility to use deferred fuel cost bonds to finance any project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other expenditure. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to cause the deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale, assignment, transfer, or issuance. Nothing shall prevent the electric utility from abandoning the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds under the financing order by filing with the Commission a statement of abandonment and the reasons therefor. The Commission shall not deny an electric utility its right to recover deferred fuel costs as otherwise provided in this section, or refuse or condition authorization or approval of the issuance and sale by an electric utility of securities or the assumption by the electric utility of liabilities or obligations, solely because of the potential availability of deferred fuel cost bond financing.\n\nC. The electric bills of an electric utility that has obtained a financing order and caused deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued shall comply with the provisions of this subsection; however, the failure of an electric utility to comply with this subsection does not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, deferred fuel cost property, deferred fuel cost charge, or deferred fuel cost bonds. The electric utility shall:\n\n1. Explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on any electric bill represents deferred fuel cost charges approved in a financing order issued to the electric utility and, if the deferred fuel cost property has been transferred to an assignee, such bill shall include a statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to deferred fuel cost charges and that the electric utility or another entity, if applicable, is acting as a collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers must indicate the deferred fuel cost charge and the ownership of the charge; and\n\n2. Include the deferred fuel cost charge on each customer's bill as a separate line item and include both the rate and the amount of the charge on each bill.\n\nD. 1. The following provisions shall be applicable to deferred fuel cost property:\n\na. All deferred fuel cost property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of deferred fuel cost charges depends on the electric utility, to which the financing order is issued, performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of deferred fuel cost charges and on future electricity consumption. The deferred fuel cost property shall exist (i) regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the deferred fuel cost property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected and (ii) notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the deferred fuel cost property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electric utility or its successors or assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers;\n\nb. Deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order shall exist until deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of such deferred fuel cost bonds have been recovered in full;\n\nc. All or any portion of deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the electric utility and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering deferred fuel cost property or issuing deferred fuel cost bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of deferred fuel cost property may be pledged to secure deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, grant of a security interest in or pledge of deferred fuel cost property by an electric utility, or an affiliate of the electric utility, to an assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, shall not require the prior consent and approval of the Commission;\n\nd. If an electric utility defaults on any required payment of charges arising from deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the deferred fuel cost property to the financing parties or their assignees. Any such financing order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or its successors or assignees;\n\ne. The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electric utility or any other entity;\n\nf. Any successor to an electric utility, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electric utility restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electric utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the deferred fuel cost property. Nothing in this subdivision f is intended to limit or impair any authority of the Commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of public utilities; and\n\ng. Deferred fuel cost bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the electric utility other than the deferred fuel cost property as specified in the financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.\n\n2. The following provisions shall be applicable to security interests:\n\na. The creation, perfection, and enforcement of any security interest in deferred fuel cost property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and other amounts payable in respect of deferred fuel cost bonds; amounts payable under any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents in respect of the deferred fuel costs; and other financing costs shall be governed by this subsection and not by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A);\n\nb. A security interest in deferred fuel cost property shall be created and enforceable when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the debtor or seller for such deferred fuel cost property, (iii) the debtor or seller has rights in such deferred fuel cost property or the power to transfer rights in such deferred fuel cost property, and (iv) a security agreement granting such security interest is executed and delivered by the debtor or seller. The description of deferred fuel cost property in a security agreement shall be sufficient if the description refers to this section and the financing order creating the deferred fuel cost property;\n\nc. A security interest shall attach without any physical delivery of collateral or other act and, upon the filing of a financing statement with the Commission, the lien of the security interest shall be valid, binding, and perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the person granting the security interest, regardless of whether the parties have notice of the lien. Also upon this filing, a transfer of an interest in the deferred fuel cost property shall be perfected against all parties having claims of any kind, including any judicial lien or other lien creditors or any claims of the transferor or creditors of the transferor, and shall have priority over all competing claims other than any prior security interest, ownership interest, or assignment in the property previously perfected in accordance with this section;\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any security interest under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of a financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A);\n\ne. The priority of a security interest in deferred fuel cost property shall not be affected by the commingling of deferred fuel cost charges with other amounts. Any pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all deferred fuel cost charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the qualifying utility in which deferred fuel cost charges have been commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party;\n\nf. No application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section shall affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of deferred fuel cost property; and\n\ng. If a default or termination occurs under the deferred fuel cost bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any deferred fuel cost property as if they were secured parties with a perfected and prior lien under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A), and the Commission may order that amounts arising from deferred fuel cost charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the Commission shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the deferred fuel cost charges.\n\n3. a. Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of deferred fuel cost property shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of and not a pledge of, or secured transaction relating to, the transferor's right, title, and interest in, to, and under the deferred fuel cost property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of an interest in deferred fuel cost property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of any fact or circumstance that might support characterization of the transfer as a secured transaction. A transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property shall occur only when all of the following have occurred: (i) the financing order creating the deferred fuel cost property has become effective, (ii) the documents evidencing the transfer of deferred fuel cost property have been executed by the transferor and delivered to the assignee, and (iii) value is received by the transferor for the deferred fuel cost property. After such a transaction, the deferred fuel cost property shall not be subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the deferred fuel cost property perfected in accordance with subdivision 2.\n\nb. The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale, and the corresponding characterization of the interest of the assignee as an ownership interest, shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:\n\n(1) Commingling of deferred fuel cost charges with other amounts;\n\n(2) The retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the deferred fuel cost property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of deferred fuel cost charges;\n\n(3) Any recourse that the assignee may have against the seller;\n\n(4) Any right or obligation that the seller may have to repurchase the deferred fuel cost charges;\n\n(5) Any indemnification obligations of the seller;\n\n(6) The obligation of the seller to collect deferred fuel cost charges on behalf of the assignee;\n\n(7) The transferor acting as the servicer of the deferred fuel cost charges or the existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electric utility, to the extent that any interest in deferred fuel cost property is sold or assigned, to agree with the assignee or any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the deferred fuel cost charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;\n\n(8) The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;\n\n(9) The granting or providing to bondholders of a preferred right to the deferred fuel cost property or credit enhancement by the electric utility or its affiliates with respect to the deferred fuel cost bonds; or\n\n(10) Any application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section.\n\nc. Any right that an electric utility has in the deferred fuel cost property before its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order shall be property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property to an assignee shall be enforceable only when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the transferor for such deferred fuel cost property, (iii) the transferor has rights in such deferred fuel cost property or the power to transfer rights in such deferred fuel cost property, and (iv) transfer documents in connection with the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds are executed and delivered by the transferor. An enforceable transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property to an assignee shall be perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subdivision 2 c. The transfer shall be perfected against third parties as of the date of filing.\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any sale, assignment, or transfer of deferred fuel cost property under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of any financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of such a financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a transfer of deferred fuel cost property.\n\ne. The priority of a transfer perfected under this section shall not be impaired by any later modification of the financing order or deferred fuel cost property or by the commingling of funds arising from deferred fuel cost property with other funds. Any other security interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under subdivision 2, shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If deferred fuel cost property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or financing party.\n\nf. The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any deferred fuel cost property shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority shall date from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with subdivision 2 c;\n\n(2) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee; and\n\n(3) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.\n\nE. The description of deferred fuel cost property being transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or other transfer agreement, granted or pledged to a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or indicated in any financing statement, shall only be sufficient if such description or indication refers to the financing order that created the deferred fuel cost property and states that the agreement or financing statement covers all or part of the property described in the financing order. This section shall apply to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or security interests in, deferred fuel cost property, regardless of whether the related sale agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document was entered into, or any financing statement was filed.\n\nF. All financing statements referenced in this section shall be subject to Part 5 of Title 8.9A (§ 8.9A-501 et seq.) of the Uniform Commercial Code, except that the requirement as to continuation statements shall not apply.\n\nG. The laws of the Commonwealth shall govern the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or creation of a security interest in any deferred fuel cost property.\n\nH. Neither the Commonwealth nor its political subdivisions shall be liable on any deferred fuel cost bonds, and the bonds shall not be a debt or a general obligation of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, nor shall they be special obligations or indebtedness of the Commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions. An issue of deferred fuel cost bonds shall not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the Commonwealth or any agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the Commonwealth to levy any tax or make any appropriation for payment of the deferred fuel cost bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of electricity. All deferred fuel cost bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: \"NEITHER THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF, OR INTEREST ON, THIS BOND.\"\n\nI. All of the following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds in deferred fuel cost bonds:\n\n1. Subject to applicable statutory restrictions on state or local investment authority, the Commonwealth, units of local government, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers, except for members of the Commission;\n\n2. Banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business;\n\n3. Personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries; and\n\n4. All other persons authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature.\n\nJ. 1. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners of the deferred fuel cost property, and other financing parties that the Commonwealth and its agencies shall not take any action listed in this subdivision. This subsection does not preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for the full protection of the deferred fuel cost charges collected pursuant to a financing order and of the bondholders and any assignee or financing party entering into a contract with the electric utility. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, shall not:\n\na. Alter the provisions of this section that authorize the Commission to create an irrevocable contract right or chose in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create deferred fuel cost property, and to make the deferred fuel cost charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, or nonbypassable charges;\n\nb. Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of deferred fuel cost property or the security for the deferred fuel cost bonds or revises the deferred fuel costs for which recovery is authorized;\n\nc. In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties; or\n\nd. Except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based adjustment mechanism authorized under this section, reduce, alter, or impair deferred fuel cost charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related deferred fuel cost bonds have been paid and performed in full.\n\n2. Any person that issues deferred fuel cost bonds may include the language specified in subdivision 1 in the deferred fuel cost bonds and related documentation.\n\nK. An assignee or financing party shall not be considered an electric utility or person providing electric service by virtue of engaging in the transactions described in this section.\n\nL. If there is a conflict between this section and any other law regarding the attachment, assignment, or perfection, or the effect of perfection, or priority of, assignment or transfer of, or security interest in deferred fuel cost property, this section shall govern.\n\nM. In making determinations under this section, the Commission may engage an outside consultant and counsel.\n\nN. If any provision of this section is held invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires for any reason, that occurrence shall not affect the validity of any action allowed under this section that is taken by an electric utility, an assignee, a financing party, a collection agent, or a party to an ancillary agreement, and any such action shall remain in full force and effect with respect to all deferred fuel cost bonds issued or authorized in a financing order issued under this section before the date that such provision is held invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, or repealed, or expires for any reason.\n\nO. As used in this section:\n\n\"Ancillary agreement\" means a bond, insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, interest rate lock or swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support arrangement, or other financial arrangement entered into in connection with deferred fuel cost bonds.\n\n\"Assignee\" means a legally recognized entity to which an electric utility assigns, sells, or transfers, other than as a security, all or a portion of its interest in or right to deferred fuel cost property. \"Assignee\" includes a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership or limited partnership, public authority trust, financing entity, or other entity to which an assignee assigns, sells, or transfers, other than as a security, all or a portion of its interest in or right to deferred fuel cost property.\n\n\"Bondholder\" means a person who holds a deferred fuel cost bond.\n\n\"Deferred fuel cost bonds\" means bonds debentures, notes, certificates of participation, certificates of beneficial interest, certificates of ownership, or other evidences of indebtedness or ownership that are issued in one or more series or tranches by an electric utility or its assignee pursuant to a financing order, the proceeds of which are used directly or indirectly to recover, finance, or refinance Commission-approved deferred fuel costs and financing costs, and that are secured by or payable from deferred fuel cost property.

All rights and interests of an electric utility or successor or assignee of the electric utility under a financing order, including the right to impose, bill, charge, collect, and receive deferred fuel cost charges authorized under the financing order and to obtain periodic adjustments to such charges as provided in the financing order; and\n\n2. All revenues, collections, claims, rights to payments, payments, money, or proceeds arising from the rights and interests specified in the financing order, regardless of whether such revenues, collections, claims, rights to payment, payments, money, or proceeds are imposed, billed, received, collected, or maintained together with or commingled with other revenues, collections, rights to payment, payments, money, or proceeds.\n\n\"Deferred fuel costs\" means the unrecovered amounts of previously incurred costs of fuel used to generate electricity, including the costs of purchased power, that have been deferred by an electric utility for future recovery from the utility's customers, along with financing costs on the utility's fuel deferral balance.\n\n\"Electric utility\" means a Phase I Utility.\n\n\"Exempt retail access customer\" means a retail customer of an electric utility that, pursuant to the provisions of § 56-577 or 56-577.1, purchased electric energy exclusively from a supplier of electric energy licensed to sell retail electric energy exclusively within the Commonwealth other than the electric utility, or that purchased electric energy from the electric utility pursuant to a Commission-approved market-based tariff, during the period when the deferred fuel costs to be financed were incurred. Such exemption shall be prorated to the extent an otherwise exempt retail customer purchased electric energy from the electric utility, in which case the retail customer shall be responsible for its pro rata share of deferred fuel cost charges authorized under a financing order.\n\n\"Financing costs\" means:\n\n1. Interest and any premium, including any acquisition, defeasance, or redemption premium, payable on deferred fuel cost bonds;\n\n2. Any payment required under any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents pertaining to deferred fuel cost bonds and any amount required to fund or replenish a reserve account or other accounts established under the terms of any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents pertaining to deferred fuel cost bonds;\n\n3.

      "text": "A. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 56-249.6 or Chapter 3 (§ 56-55 et seq.), an electric utility, on or before July 1, 2024, may petition the Commission for a financing order and the Commission shall either issue (i) such financing order or (ii) an order rejecting the petition, no more than four months from the date of filing such petition and in accordance with the requirements of subdivision 2.\n\n1. The petition shall include (i) an estimate of the total amount of deferred fuel costs that the electric utility has incurred over the time period noted in the petition; (ii) an indication of whether the electric utility proposes to finance all or a portion of the deferred fuel costs using one or more series or tranches of deferred fuel cost bonds; (iii) an estimate and details of the financing costs related to the deferred fuel costs to be financed through the deferred fuel cost bonds; (iv) an estimate of the deferred fuel cost charges necessary to recover the deferred fuel costs and all financing costs and the proposed period for recovery of such costs; (v) a description of any benefits expected to result from the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds, including the avoidance of or significant mitigation of abrupt and significant increases in rates to the electric utility's customers for the applicable time period; and (vi) direct testimony and exhibits supporting the petition. If the electric utility proposes to finance a portion of the deferred fuel costs, the electric utility shall identify in the petition the specific amount of deferred fuel costs for the applicable time period to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds. By electing not to finance a portion of the deferred fuel costs for an applicable time period using deferred fuel cost bonds, an electric utility shall not be deemed to waive its right to recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the Commission.\n\n2. a. If an electric utility petitions the Commission for a financing order pursuant to this section, following notice and an opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall either issue (i) a financing order or (ii) an order rejecting the petition, not more than four months from the date of filing such petition.\n\nb. A financing order issued by the Commission pursuant to this section shall include:\n\n(1) The amount of deferred fuel costs to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds. The Commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may be recovered through deferred fuel cost charges. The financing order shall also specify the period over which deferred fuel costs and financing costs may be recovered and whether the deferred fuel cost bonds may be offered and issued in one or more series or tranches during a fixed period not to exceed one year after the date of the financing order;\n\n(2) A finding that the proposed issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds is in the public interest and the associated deferred fuel cost charges are just and reasonable;\n\n(3) A finding that the structuring and pricing of the deferred fuel cost bonds are reasonably expected to result in reasonable deferred fuel cost charges consistent with market conditions at the time the deferred fuel cost bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order;\n\n(4) A requirement that, for so long as the deferred fuel cost bonds are outstanding and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of deferred fuel cost charges authorized under a financing order shall be non-bypassable and paid by all retail customers of the electric utility, irrespective of the generation supplier of such customer, except for an exempt retail access customer;\n\n(5) A formula-based true-up mechanism for making annual adjustments to the deferred fuel cost charges that customers are required to pay pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of deferred fuel cost bonds and financing costs and other required amounts and charges payable in connection with the deferred fuel cost bonds;\n\n(6) The deferred fuel cost property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an electric utility or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure deferred fuel cost bonds and all financing costs;\n\n(7) The authority of the electric utility to establish the terms and conditions of the deferred fuel cost bonds, including repayment schedules, expected interest rates, the issuance in one or more series or tranches with different maturity dates, and other financing costs;\n\n(8) A finding that the deferred fuel cost charges shall be allocated among customer classes in accordance with the methodology approved in the electric utility's last fuel factor proceeding;\n\n(9) A requirement that after the final terms of an issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds have been established and before the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds, the electric utility determines the resulting initial deferred fuel cost charge in accordance with the financing order and that such initial deferred fuel cost charge be final and effective upon the issuance of such deferred fuel cost bonds without further Commission action so long as such initial deferred fuel cost charge is consistent with the financing order;\n\n(10) A method of tracing funds collected as deferred fuel cost charges, or other proceeds of deferred fuel cost property, and a requirement that such method be the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any deferred fuel cost property subject to the financing order under applicable law; and\n\n(11) Any other conditions not otherwise inconsistent with this section that the Commission determines are appropriate.\n\nc. A financing order issued to an electric utility may provide that creation of the electric utility's deferred fuel cost property is conditioned upon, and simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer for the deferred fuel cost property to an assignee and the pledge of the deferred fuel cost property to secure deferred fuel cost bonds.\n\nd. If the Commission issues a financing order, the Commission shall establish a protocol for the electric utility to annually file a petition or, in the Commission's discretion, a letter setting out application of the formula-based mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make applicable adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are any mathematical or clerical errors in the application of the formula-based mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of deferred fuel cost charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in respect of deferred fuel cost bonds approved under the financing order. Within 30 days after receiving an electric utility's request pursuant to this subdivision d, the Commission shall either approve the request or inform the electric utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the Commission informs the electric utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the electric utility may correct its error and refile its request. The time frames previously described in this subdivision d shall apply to a refiled request.\n\ne. Subsequent to the transfer of deferred fuel cost property to an assignee or the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds authorized thereby, whichever is earlier, a financing order shall be irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based mechanism authorized in this section, the Commission shall not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust deferred fuel cost charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer deferred fuel cost property or to cause deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance.\n\n3. At the request of an electric utility, the Commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or refunding deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the Commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in this section for a financing order. Effective upon retirement of the refunded deferred fuel cost bonds and the issuance of new deferred fuel cost bonds, the Commission shall adjust the related deferred fuel cost charges accordingly.\n\n4. a. A financing order shall remain in effect and deferred fuel cost property under the financing order shall continue to exist until deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all Commission-approved financing costs of such deferred fuel cost bonds have been recovered in full.\n\nb. A financing order issued to an electric utility shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, merger, or sale of the electric utility or its successors or assignees.\n\nB. 1. The Commission shall not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties regarding any matter within its authority pursuant to this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, consider the deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to a financing order to be the debt of the electric utility other than for federal income tax purposes, consider the deferred fuel cost charges paid under the financing order to be the revenue of the electric utility for any purpose, or consider the deferred fuel costs or financing costs specified in the financing order to be the costs of the electric utility, nor shall the Commission determine any action taken by an electric utility that is consistent with the financing order to be unjust or unreasonable.\n\n2. The Commission shall not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electric utility to use deferred fuel cost bonds to finance any project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other expenditure. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to cause the deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale, assignment, transfer, or issuance. Nothing shall prevent the electric utility from abandoning the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds under the financing order by filing with the Commission a statement of abandonment and the reasons therefor. The Commission shall not deny an electric utility its right to recover deferred fuel costs as otherwise provided in this section, or refuse or condition authorization or approval of the issuance and sale by an electric utility of securities or the assumption by the electric utility of liabilities or obligations, solely because of the potential availability of deferred fuel cost bond financing.\n\nC. The electric bills of an electric utility that has obtained a financing order and caused deferred fuel cost bonds to be issued shall comply with the provisions of this subsection; however, the failure of an electric utility to comply with this subsection does not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, deferred fuel cost property, deferred fuel cost charge, or deferred fuel cost bonds. The electric utility shall:\n\n1. Explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on any electric bill represents deferred fuel cost charges approved in a financing order issued to the electric utility and, if the deferred fuel cost property has been transferred to an assignee, such bill shall include a statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to deferred fuel cost charges and that the electric utility or another entity, if applicable, is acting as a collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers must indicate the deferred fuel cost charge and the ownership of the charge; and\n\n2. Include the deferred fuel cost charge on each customer's bill as a separate line item and include both the rate and the amount of the charge on each bill.\n\nD. 1. The following provisions shall be applicable to deferred fuel cost property:\n\na. All deferred fuel cost property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of deferred fuel cost charges depends on the electric utility, to which the financing order is issued, performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of deferred fuel cost charges and on future electricity consumption. The deferred fuel cost property shall exist (i) regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the deferred fuel cost property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected and (ii) notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the deferred fuel cost property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electric utility or its successors or assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers;\n\nb. Deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order shall exist until deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of such deferred fuel cost bonds have been recovered in full;\n\nc. All or any portion of deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the electric utility and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering deferred fuel cost property or issuing deferred fuel cost bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of deferred fuel cost property may be pledged to secure deferred fuel cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, grant of a security interest in or pledge of deferred fuel cost property by an electric utility, or an affiliate of the electric utility, to an assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, shall not require the prior consent and approval of the Commission;\n\nd. If an electric utility defaults on any required payment of charges arising from deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the deferred fuel cost property to the financing parties or their assignees. Any such financing order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or its successors or assignees;\n\ne. The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in deferred fuel cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electric utility or any other entity;\n\nf. Any successor to an electric utility, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electric utility restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electric utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the deferred fuel cost property. Nothing in this subdivision f is intended to limit or impair any authority of the Commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of public utilities; and\n\ng. Deferred fuel cost bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the electric utility other than the deferred fuel cost property as specified in the financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.\n\n2. The following provisions shall be applicable to security interests:\n\na. The creation, perfection, and enforcement of any security interest in deferred fuel cost property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and other amounts payable in respect of deferred fuel cost bonds; amounts payable under any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents in respect of the deferred fuel costs; and other financing costs shall be governed by this subsection and not by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A);\n\nb. A security interest in deferred fuel cost property shall be created and enforceable when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the debtor or seller for such deferred fuel cost property, (iii) the debtor or seller has rights in such deferred fuel cost property or the power to transfer rights in such deferred fuel cost property, and (iv) a security agreement granting such security interest is executed and delivered by the debtor or seller. The description of deferred fuel cost property in a security agreement shall be sufficient if the description refers to this section and the financing order creating the deferred fuel cost property;\n\nc. A security interest shall attach without any physical delivery of collateral or other act and, upon the filing of a financing statement with the Commission, the lien of the security interest shall be valid, binding, and perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the person granting the security interest, regardless of whether the parties have notice of the lien. Also upon this filing, a transfer of an interest in the deferred fuel cost property shall be perfected against all parties having claims of any kind, including any judicial lien or other lien creditors or any claims of the transferor or creditors of the transferor, and shall have priority over all competing claims other than any prior security interest, ownership interest, or assignment in the property previously perfected in accordance with this section;\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any security interest under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of a financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A);\n\ne. The priority of a security interest in deferred fuel cost property shall not be affected by the commingling of deferred fuel cost charges with other amounts. Any pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all deferred fuel cost charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the qualifying utility in which deferred fuel cost charges have been commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party;\n\nf. No application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section shall affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of deferred fuel cost property; and\n\ng. If a default or termination occurs under the deferred fuel cost bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any deferred fuel cost property as if they were secured parties with a perfected and prior lien under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A), and the Commission may order that amounts arising from deferred fuel cost charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the Commission shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the deferred fuel cost charges.\n\n3. a. Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of deferred fuel cost property shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of and not a pledge of, or secured transaction relating to, the transferor's right, title, and interest in, to, and under the deferred fuel cost property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of an interest in deferred fuel cost property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of any fact or circumstance that might support characterization of the transfer as a secured transaction. A transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property shall occur only when all of the following have occurred: (i) the financing order creating the deferred fuel cost property has become effective, (ii) the documents evidencing the transfer of deferred fuel cost property have been executed by the transferor and delivered to the assignee, and (iii) value is received by the transferor for the deferred fuel cost property. After such a transaction, the deferred fuel cost property shall not be subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the deferred fuel cost property perfected in accordance with subdivision 2.\n\nb. The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale, and the corresponding characterization of the interest of the assignee as an ownership interest, shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:\n\n(1) Commingling of deferred fuel cost charges with other amounts;\n\n(2) The retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the deferred fuel cost property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of deferred fuel cost charges;\n\n(3) Any recourse that the assignee may have against the seller;\n\n(4) Any right or obligation that the seller may have to repurchase the deferred fuel cost charges;\n\n(5) Any indemnification obligations of the seller;\n\n(6) The obligation of the seller to collect deferred fuel cost charges on behalf of the assignee;\n\n(7) The transferor acting as the servicer of the deferred fuel cost charges or the existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electric utility, to the extent that any interest in deferred fuel cost property is sold or assigned, to agree with the assignee or any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the deferred fuel cost charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;\n\n(8) The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;\n\n(9) The granting or providing to bondholders of a preferred right to the deferred fuel cost property or credit enhancement by the electric utility or its affiliates with respect to the deferred fuel cost bonds; or\n\n(10) Any application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section.\n\nc. Any right that an electric utility has in the deferred fuel cost property before its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order shall be property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property to an assignee shall be enforceable only when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the transferor for such deferred fuel cost property, (iii) the transferor has rights in such deferred fuel cost property or the power to transfer rights in such deferred fuel cost property, and (iv) transfer documents in connection with the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds are executed and delivered by the transferor. An enforceable transfer of an interest in deferred fuel cost property to an assignee shall be perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subdivision 2 c. The transfer shall be perfected against third parties as of the date of filing.\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any sale, assignment, or transfer of deferred fuel cost property under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of any financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code (Titles 8.1A through 8.9A). The filing of such a financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a transfer of deferred fuel cost property.\n\ne. The priority of a transfer perfected under this section shall not be impaired by any later modification of the financing order or deferred fuel cost property or by the commingling of funds arising from deferred fuel cost property with other funds. Any other security interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under subdivision 2, shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If deferred fuel cost property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or financing party.\n\nf. The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any deferred fuel cost property shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority shall date from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with subdivision 2 c;\n\n(2) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee; and\n\n(3) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.\n\nE. The description of deferred fuel cost property being transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or other transfer agreement, granted or pledged to a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or indicated in any financing statement, shall only be sufficient if such description or indication refers to the financing order that created the deferred fuel cost property and states that the agreement or financing statement covers all or part of the property described in the financing order. This section shall apply to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or security interests in, deferred fuel cost property, regardless of whether the related sale agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document was entered into, or any financing statement was filed.\n\nF. All financing statements referenced in this section shall be subject to Part 5 of Title 8.9A (§ 8.9A-501 et seq.) of the Uniform Commercial Code, except that the requirement as to continuation statements shall not apply.\n\nG. The laws of the Commonwealth shall govern the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or creation of a security interest in any deferred fuel cost property.\n\nH. Neither the Commonwealth nor its political subdivisions shall be liable on any deferred fuel cost bonds, and the bonds shall not be a debt or a general obligation of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, nor shall they be special obligations or indebtedness of the Commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions. An issue of deferred fuel cost bonds shall not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the Commonwealth or any agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the Commonwealth to levy any tax or make any appropriation for payment of the deferred fuel cost bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of electricity. All deferred fuel cost bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: \"NEITHER THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF, OR INTEREST ON, THIS BOND.\"\n\nI. All of the following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds in deferred fuel cost bonds:\n\n1. Subject to applicable statutory restrictions on state or local investment authority, the Commonwealth, units of local government, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers, except for members of the Commission;\n\n2. Banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business;\n\n3. Personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries; and\n\n4. All other persons authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature.\n\nJ. 1. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners of the deferred fuel cost property, and other financing parties that the Commonwealth and its agencies shall not take any action listed in this subdivision. This subsection does not preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for the full protection of the deferred fuel cost charges collected pursuant to a financing order and of the bondholders and any assignee or financing party entering into a contract with the electric utility. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, shall not:\n\na. Alter the provisions of this section that authorize the Commission to create an irrevocable contract right or chose in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create deferred fuel cost property, and to make the deferred fuel cost charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, or nonbypassable charges;\n\nb. Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of deferred fuel cost property or the security for the deferred fuel cost bonds or revises the deferred fuel costs for which recovery is authorized;\n\nc. In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties; or\n\nd. Except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based adjustment mechanism authorized under this section, reduce, alter, or impair deferred fuel cost charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related deferred fuel cost bonds have been paid and performed in full.\n\n2. Any person that issues deferred fuel cost bonds may include the language specified in subdivision 1 in the deferred fuel cost bonds and related documentation.\n\nK. An assignee or financing party shall not be considered an electric utility or person providing electric service by virtue of engaging in the transactions described in this section.\n\nL. If there is a conflict between this section and any other law regarding the attachment, assignment, or perfection, or the effect of perfection, or priority of, assignment or transfer of, or security interest in deferred fuel cost property, this section shall govern.\n\nM.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 3 (§ 56-55 et seq.), an electric utility may petition the Commission for a financing order pursuant to this section. No more than four months after the date such petition is filed, the Commission shall issue either (i) such financing order in accordance with the requirements of subdivision 2 or (ii) an order rejecting the petition.\n\n1. The petition shall include (i) an estimate of the total amount of any securitized asset costs that the electric utility has incurred over the time period noted in the petition; (ii) an indication of whether the electric utility proposes to finance all or a portion of the securitized asset costs using one or more series or tranches of securitized asset cost bonds; (iii) an estimate and details of the financing costs related to the securitized asset costs to be financed through the securitized asset cost bonds; (iv) an estimate of the securitized asset cost charges necessary to recover the securitized asset costs and all financing costs and the proposed period for recovery of such costs; (v) a description of any benefits expected to result from the issuance of securitized asset cost bonds, including the avoidance of or significant mitigation of abrupt and significant increases in rates to the electric utility's customers for the applicable time period; and (vi) direct testimony and exhibits supporting the petition. If the electric utility proposes to finance a portion of the securitized asset costs, the electric utility shall identify in the petition the specific amount of securitized asset costs for the applicable time period to be financed using securitized asset cost bonds. By electing not to finance a portion of the securitized asset costs for an applicable time period using securitized asset cost bonds, an electric utility shall not be deemed to waive its right to recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the Commission.\n\n2. a. A financing order issued by the Commission pursuant to this section shall include:\n\n(1) The amount of securitized asset costs to be financed using securitized asset cost bonds. The Commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may be recovered through securitized asset cost charges. The financing order shall also specify the period over which securitized asset costs and financing costs may be recovered and whether the securitized asset cost bonds may be offered and issued in one or more series or tranches during a fixed period not to exceed one year after the date of the financing order;\n\n(2) A finding that the proposed issuance of securitized asset cost bonds is in the public interest and the associated securitized asset cost charges are just and reasonable;\n\n(3) A finding that the structuring and pricing of the securitized asset cost bonds are reasonably expected to result in reasonable securitized asset charges consistent with market conditions at the time the securitized asset cost bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order;\n\n(4) A requirement that, for so long as the securitized asset cost bonds are outstanding and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of securitized asset cost charges authorized under a financing order shall be non-bypassable and paid by all retail customers of the electric utility, irrespective of the generation supplier of such customer, except for an exempt retail access customer;\n\n(5) A formula-based true-up mechanism for making annual adjustments to the securitized asset cost charges that customers are required to pay pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of securitized asset cost bonds and financing costs and other required amounts and charges payable in connection with the securitized asset cost bonds;\n\n(6) The securitized asset cost property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an electric utility or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure securitized asset cost bonds and all financing costs;\n\n(7) The authority of the electric utility to establish (i) the terms and conditions of the securitized asset cost bonds, including repayment schedules, expected interest rates, the issuance in one or more series or tranches with different maturity dates, and other financing costs, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the ancillary documents related to the securitized asset cost bonds, including servicing arrangements for securitized asset cost charges;\n\n(8) A finding that the securitized asset cost charges shall be allocated among customer classes in accordance with the methodology approved in the electric utility's most recent base rate case;\n\n(9) A requirement that after the final terms of an issuance of securitized asset cost bonds have been established and before the issuance of securitized asset cost bonds, the electric utility determines the resulting initial securitized asset cost charge in accordance with the financing order and that such initial securitized asset cost charge be final and effective upon the issuance of such securitized asset cost bonds without further Commission action so long as such initial securitized asset cost charge is consistent with the financing order;\n\n(10) A method of tracing funds collected as securitized asset cost charges, or other proceeds of securitized asset cost property, and a requirement that such method be the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any securitized asset cost property subject to the financing order under applicable law;\n\n(11) A requirement that the electric utility's base rates, exclusive of the cost of securitized asset cost bonds, reflect the reduction of rates associated with securitization effective on the date on which proceeds from the issuance of the securitized asset cost bonds are received by the electric utility. Such requirement may be met through the use of a temporary tracker to credit customers until such reduction is reflected in the base rates established through the electric utility's next base rate case;\n\n(12) Any other conditions not otherwise inconsistent with this section that the Commission determines are appropriate;\n\n(13) A requirement that the electric utility's base rates, exclusive of the cost of securitized asset cost bonds, reflect the reduction of rate base associated with the securitization of utility plant balances effective on the date proceeds from the issuance of the securitized asset cost bonds are received by the utility. This can be accomplished through the use of a temporary tracker to credit customers until the electric utility's next base rate case, at which point the reduction in rate base shall be reflected in base rates;\n\n(14) A method of tracing funds collected as securitized asset cost charges, or other proceeds of securitized asset cost property, and a requirement that such method be the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any securitized asset cost property subject to the financing order under applicable law; and\n\n(15) Any other conditions not otherwise inconsistent with this section that the Commission determines are appropriate.\n\nb. Neither a financing order issued pursuant to this section nor the Commission's approval of a petition for a financing order shall require that securitized asset cost bonds be marketed as a specified type of security or that the assignee be formed as a specified type of entity. The electric utility shall maintain discretion to determine the type of security that securitized asset cost bonds shall be.\n\nc. A financing order issued to an electric utility may provide that creation of the electric utility's securitized asset cost property is conditioned upon, and simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer for the securitized asset cost property to an assignee and the pledge of the securitized asset cost property to secure securitized asset cost bonds.\n\nd. If the Commission issues a financing order, the Commission shall establish a protocol for the electric utility to annually file a petition or, in the Commission's discretion, a letter setting out application of the formula-based mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make applicable adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are any mathematical or clerical errors in the application of the formula-based mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of securitized asset cost charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in respect of securitized asset cost bonds approved under the financing order. Within 30 days after receiving an electric utility's request pursuant to this subdivision d, the Commission shall either approve the request or inform the electric utility of any mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the Commission informs the electric utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the electric utility may correct such errors and refile its request. The 30-day time frame previously described in this subdivision d shall apply to a refiled request.\n\ne. Subsequent to the transfer of securitized asset cost property to an assignee or the issuance of securitized asset cost bonds authorized thereby, whichever is earlier, a financing order shall be irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based mechanism authorized in this section, the Commission shall not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust securitized asset cost charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer securitized asset cost property or to cause securitized asset cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance.\n\n3. At the request of an electric utility, the Commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or refunding securitized asset cost bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the Commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in this section for a financing order. Effective upon retirement of the refunded securitized asset bonds and the issuance of new securitized asset cost bonds, the Commission shall adjust the related securitized asset cost charges accordingly.\n\n4. a. A financing order shall remain in effect and securitized asset cost property under the financing order shall continue to exist until securitized asset cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all Commission-approved financing costs of such securitized asset cost bonds have been recovered in full.\n\nb. A financing order issued to an electric utility shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, merger, or sale of the electric utility or its successors or assignees.\n\nC. 1. The Commission shall not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties regarding any matter within its authority pursuant to this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, (i) consider the securitized asset cost bonds issued pursuant to a financing order to be the debt of the electric utility other than for federal income tax purposes, including for any purpose under § 56-585.8; (ii) consider the securitized asset cost charges paid under the financing order to be the revenue of the electric utility for any purpose, including for any purpose under § 56-585.8; (iii) consider the securitized asset costs or financing costs specified in the financing order to be the costs of the electric utility, including for any purpose under § 56-585.8; or (iv) determine any action taken by an electric utility that is consistent with the financing order to be unjust or unreasonable.\n\n2. The Commission shall not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electric utility to use securitized asset cost bonds to finance any project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other expenditure. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility shall retain sole discretion regarding whether to cause the securitized asset cost bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale, assignment, transfer, or issuance. Nothing shall prevent the electric utility from abandoning the issuance of securitized asset cost bonds under the financing order by filing with the Commission a statement of abandonment and the reasons therefor. The Commission shall not deny an electric utility its right to recover securitized asset costs as otherwise provided in this section, or refuse or condition authorization or approval of the issuance and sale by an electric utility of securities or the assumption by the electric utility of liabilities or obligations, solely because of the potential availability of securitized asset cost bond financing.\n\nD. The electric bills of an electric utility that has obtained a financing order and caused securitized asset cost bonds to be issued shall comply with the provisions of this subsection; however, the failure of an electric utility to comply with this subsection shall not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, securitized asset cost property, securitized asset cost charge, or securitized asset cost bonds. The electric utility shall:\n\n1. Explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on any electric bill represents securitized asset cost charges approved in a financing order issued to the electric utility and, if the securitized asset cost property has been transferred to an assignee, such bill shall include a statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to securitized asset cost charges and that the electric utility or another entity, if applicable, is acting as a collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers must indicate the securitized asset cost charge and the ownership of the charge; and\n\n2. Include the securitized asset cost charge on each customer's bill as a separate line item and include both the rate and the amount of the charge on each bill.\n\nE. 1. The following provisions shall be applicable to securitized asset cost property:\n\na. All securitized asset cost property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of securitized asset cost charges depends on the electric utility, to which the financing order is issued, performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of securitized asset cost charges and on future electricity consumption. The securitized asset cost property shall exist (i) regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the securitized asset cost property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected and (ii) notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the securitized asset cost property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electric utility or its successors or assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers;\n\nb. Securitized asset cost property specified in a financing order shall exist until securitized asset cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of such securitized asset cost bonds have been recovered in full;\n\nc. All or any portion of securitized asset cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the electric utility and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering securitized asset cost property or issuing securitized asset cost bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of securitized asset cost property may be pledged to secure securitized asset cost bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, or grant of a security interest in or pledge of securitized asset cost property by an electric utility, or an affiliate of the electric utility, to an assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, shall not require the prior consent and approval of the Commission;\n\nd. If an electric utility defaults on any required payment of charges arising from securitized asset cost property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the securitized asset cost property to the financing parties or their assignees. Any such financing order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or its successors or assignees;\n\ne. The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in securitized asset cost property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electric utility or any other entity;\n\nf. Any successor to an electric utility, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electric utility restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electric utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the securitized asset cost property. Nothing in this subdivision f is intended to limit or impair any authority of the Commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of public utilities; and\n\ng. Securitized asset cost bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the electric utility other than the securitized asset cost property as specified in the financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.\n\n2. The following provisions shall be applicable to security interests:\n\na. The creation, perfection, and enforcement of any security interest in securitized asset cost property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and other amounts payable in respect of securitized asset cost bonds; amounts payable under any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents in respect of the securitized asset costs; and other financing costs shall be governed by this subsection and not by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code;\n\nb. A security interest in securitized asset cost property shall be created and enforceable when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the debtor or seller for such securitized asset cost property, (iii) the debtor or seller has rights in such securitized asset cost property or the power to transfer rights in such securitized asset cost property, and (iv) a security agreement granting such security interest is executed and delivered by the debtor or seller. The description of securitized asset cost property in a security agreement shall be sufficient if the description refers to this section and the financing order creating the securitized asset cost property;\n\nc. A security interest shall attach without any physical delivery of collateral or other act and, upon the filing of a financing statement with the Commission, the lien of the security interest shall be valid, binding, and perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the person granting the security interest, regardless of whether the parties have notice of the lien. Also upon this filing, a transfer of an interest in the securitized asset cost property shall be perfected against all parties having claims of any kind, including any judicial lien or other lien creditors or any claims of the transferor or creditors of the transferor, and shall have priority over all competing claims other than any prior security interest, ownership interest, or assignment in the property previously perfected in accordance with this section;\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any security interest under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code. The filing of a financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code;\n\ne. The priority of a security interest in securitized asset cost property shall not be affected by the commingling of securitized asset cost charges with other amounts. Any pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all securitized asset cost charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the qualifying utility in which securitized asset cost charges have been commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party;\n\nf. No application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section shall affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of securitized asset cost property; and\n\ng. If a default or termination occurs under the securitized asset cost bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any securitized asset cost property as if they were secured parties with a perfected and prior lien under the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Commission may order that amounts arising from securitized asset cost charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the Commission shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the securitized asset cost charges.\n\n3. a. Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of securitized asset cost property shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of and not a pledge of, or secured transaction relating to, the transferor's right, title, and interest in, to, and under the securitized asset cost property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of an interest in securitized asset cost property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of any fact or circumstance that might support characterization of the transfer as a secured transaction. A transfer of an interest in securitized asset cost property shall occur only when all of the following have occurred: (i) the financing order creating the securitized asset cost property has become effective, (ii) the documents evidencing the transfer of securitized asset cost property have been executed by the transferor and delivered to the assignee, and (iii) value is received by the transferor for the securitized asset cost property. After such a transaction, the securitized asset cost property shall not be subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the securitized asset cost property perfected in accordance with subdivision 2.\n\nb. The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale, and the corresponding characterization of the interest of the assignee as an ownership interest, shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:\n\n(1) Commingling of securitized asset cost charges with other amounts;\n\n(2) The retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the securitized asset cost property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of securitized asset cost charges;\n\n(3) Any recourse that the assignee may have against the seller;\n\n(4) Any right or obligation that the seller may have to repurchase the securitized asset cost charges;\n\n(5) Any indemnification obligations of the seller;\n\n(6) The obligation of the seller to collect securitized asset cost charges on behalf of the assignee;\n\n(7) The transferor acting as the servicer of the securitized asset cost charges or the existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electric utility, to the extent that any interest in securitized asset cost property is sold or assigned, to agree with the assignee or any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the securitized asset cost charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;\n\n(8) The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;\n\n(9) The granting or providing to bondholders of a preferred right to the securitized asset cost property or credit enhancement by the electric utility or its affiliates with respect to the securitized asset cost bonds; or\n\n(10) Any application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this section.\n\nc. Any right that an electric utility has in the securitized asset cost property before its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order shall be property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in securitized asset cost property to an assignee shall be enforceable only when all of the following have occurred: (i) a financing order is issued, (ii) value is received by the transferor for such securitized asset cost property, (iii) the transferor has rights in such securitized asset cost property or the power to transfer rights in such securitized asset cost property, and (iv) transfer documents in connection with the issuance of securitized asset cost bonds are executed and delivered by the transferor. An enforceable transfer of an interest in securitized asset cost property to an assignee shall be perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subdivision 2 c. The transfer shall be perfected against third parties as of the date of filing.\n\nd. The Commission shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any sale, assignment, or transfer of securitized asset cost property under this section in the same manner that the Commission maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the Uniform Commercial Code. The filing of any financing statement under this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the Uniform Commercial Code. The filing of such a financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a transfer of securitized asset cost property.\n\ne. The priority of a transfer perfected under this section shall not be impaired by any later modification of the financing order or securitized asset cost property or by the commingling of funds arising from securitized asset cost property with other funds. Any other security interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under subdivision 2, shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If securitized asset cost property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or financing party.\n\nf. The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any securitized asset cost property shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority shall date from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with subdivision 2 c;\n\n(2) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee; and\n\n(3) A perfected interest or right of an assignee shall have priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.\n\nF. The description of securitized asset cost property being transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or other transfer agreement, granted or pledged to a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or indicated in any financing statement shall only be sufficient if such description or indication refers to the financing order that created the securitized asset cost property and states that the agreement or financing statement covers all or part of the property described in the financing order. This section shall apply to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or security interests in, securitized asset cost property, regardless of whether the related sale agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document was entered into, or any financing statement was filed.\n\nG. All financing statements referenced in this section shall be subject to Part 5 of Title 8.9A (§ 8.9A-501 et seq.) of the Uniform Commercial Code, except that the requirement as to continuation statements shall not apply.\n\nH. The laws of the Commonwealth shall govern the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or creation of a security interest in any securitized asset cost property.\n\nI. Neither the Commonwealth nor its political subdivisions shall be liable on any securitized asset cost bonds, and the bonds shall not be a debt or a general obligation of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, nor shall they be special obligations or indebtedness of the Commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions. An issue of securitized asset cost bonds shall not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the Commonwealth or any agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the Commonwealth to levy any tax or make any appropriation for payment of the securitized asset cost bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of electricity. All securitized asset cost bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: \"NEITHER THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF, OR INTEREST ON, THIS BOND.\"\n\nJ. All of the following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds in securitized asset cost bonds:\n\n1. Subject to applicable statutory restrictions on state or local investment authority, the Commonwealth, units of local government, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers, except for members of the Commission;\n\n2. Banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business;\n\n3. Personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries; and\n\n4. All other persons authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature.\n\nK. 1. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners of the securitized asset cost property, and other financing parties that the Commonwealth and its agencies shall not take any action listed in this subdivision. This subsection does not preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for the full protection of the securitized asset cost charges collected pursuant to a financing order and of the bondholders and any assignee or financing party entering into a contract with the electric utility. The Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, shall not:\n\na. Alter the provisions of this section that authorize the Commission to create an irrevocable contract right or chose in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create securitized asset cost property, and to make the securitized asset cost charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, or non-bypassable charges;\n\nb. Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of securitized asset cost property or the security for the securitized asset cost bonds or revises the securitized asset costs for which recovery is authorized;\n\nc. In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties; or\n\nd. Except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based adjustment mechanism authorized under this section, reduce, alter, or impair securitized asset cost charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related securitized asset cost bonds have been paid and performed in full.\n\n2. Any person that issues securitized asset cost bonds may include the language specified in subdivision 1 in the securitized asset cost bonds and related documentation.\n\nL. An assignee or financing party shall not be considered an electric utility or person providing electric service by virtue of engaging in the transactions described in this section.\n\nM. If there is a conflict between this section and any other law regarding the attachment, assignment, or perfection, or the effect of perfection, or priority of, assignment or transfer of, or security interest in securitized asset cost property, this section shall govern.\n\nN. In making determinations under this section, the Commission may engage an outside consultant and counsel.\n\nO. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of an electric utility to seek any available relief pursuant to any other provision of law, including § 56-585.8.\n\nP. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any customer that has chosen to purchase electric energy from a licensed supplier other than the incumbent electric utility serving the exclusive territory in which such customer is located pursuant to § 56-577 prior to February 1, 2019.\n\n2025, cc. 497, 597.",

Any corporation of the character mentioned in this chapter or in Chapter 2 (§ 56-49 et seq.) may contract with any person or corporation, the owner of lands, or of any interest, franchise, privilege, or easement therein, over, under, or through which any pipeline transmitting petroleum products or natural gas, power or telephone line, sewer or water main or similar works is to be constructed, for the right-of-way for such line, sewer, main or works, and for sufficient land for its necessary offices, plant, or plants, works, stations and structures. All such contracts shall specify with reasonable particularity and definiteness the location of such easement of right-of-way; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to contracts between any such corporation and any political subdivision of this Commonwealth, but any such corporation shall provide the location of its facilities on land owned by such a political subdivision upon request of such political subdivision.\n\nB. The location of any easement of right-of-way of any public service corporation shall be as specified in the instrument by which such easement was conveyed to such public service corporation; provided that, with respect to all such easements granted after December 31, 1968, if such location is not specified by metes and bounds or by reference to a center line or survey line showing courses and distances from some ascertainable point of beginning, the location of such easement shall be determined by reference to the facilities constructed thereon, and the center line of those facilities shall be the center line of the easement.\n\nC. Prior to acquiring any easement of right-of-way, public service corporations will consider the feasibility of locating such facilities on, over, or under existing easements of rights-of-way. In the event any public service corporation owning a right-of-way shall deny a request of any other public service corporation for joint use of that right-of-way, the corporation whose request is denied shall have the right, within thirty days after the denial to apply to the Commission for an order requiring such joint use. The Commission shall conduct a hearing on such application and shall direct the corporation owning the right-of-way to allow joint use if the Commission finds that such joint use is reasonable and that the present or future public utility service of such corporation will not be adversely affected by such joint use. In making such determination, the Commission may establish the terms and conditions for such joint use, including, without limitation, a requirement of compensation by the utility making the request to the utility owning the right-of-way, if the Commission finds such a requirement to be appropriate.\n\nD. In any case involving an application for a certificate pursuant to § 56-265.2, the governing body of each locality in which a gas pipeline or electrical transmission line would be located shall have the right to request the Commission to consider directing a joint use of right-of-way within that locality pursuant to the standards in subsection C of this section, provided that the governing body shall file its request no later than the date for public comment on the application established by the Commission.\n\nE. A renewable generator, as defined in § 56-614, should where feasible locate distribution facilities, as defined in § 56-614, that are required to connect its renewable energy facility that generates electricity to the electric distribution grid, to distribute steam generated at such facility, or to distribute its landfill gas to customers or a natural gas distribution or transmission pipeline, as applicable, on, over, or under existing easements of rights-of-way of a public service corporation. The renewable generator shall request joint use of the right-of-way from the public service corporation that owns the easement of right-of-way and shall offer to enter into an agreement that will specify the terms and conditions, including rental, under which such joint use will occur. The compensation to be paid to the public service corporation for such joint use shall be as negotiated between the public service corporation and the renewable generator. If any public service corporation owning an easement of right-of-way shall deny a request for the joint use of that right-of-way, the renewable generator shall have the right, exercisable within 30 days after the denial, to apply to the Commission for an order requiring such joint use. The Commission shall conduct a hearing on such application and shall direct the public service corporation owning the easement of right-of-way to allow joint use if the Commission finds that such joint use is reasonable and that the present or future public utility service of such corporation will not be adversely affected by such joint use. In making such determination, the Commission may establish the terms and conditions for such joint use, including, without limitation, the rental compensation that the renewable generator shall pay to the public service corporation owning the easement of right-of-way. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to railroads.\n\nCode 1919, § 4062; 1964, c. 523; 1968, c. 534; 1972, c. 519; 1979, c. 309; 2001, cc. 745, 752; 2009, c. 807.",

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, all powers of a multistate entity shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and all business and affairs of the multistate entity shall be managed under the direction of, a governing board, which may be titled a board of directors, board of trustees, or similar appellation. The governing board shall be comprised of (i) two members residing in the Commonwealth for each locality of the Commonwealth wherein the multistate entity provides sewage treatment services and (ii) a number of members residing in the adjacent state that is equal to the number of members residing in the Commonwealth.

If a quorum is present when a vote of the governing board is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of members present is the act of the governing board unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of the multistate entity requires the vote of a greater number of members. Except as provided in this section, the provisions of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of a multistate entity in effect prior to July 1, 2006, shall continue to apply with respect to the method of appointing the board members residing in the adjacent state and the duration of their terms, and to other matters relating to the governing board of such multistate entity, except that no amendment to the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of the multistate entity that contravenes any provision of this section shall be effective.\n\nC.

The multistate entity and the nonpetitioning members of the governing board shall be parties to the proceeding. With the petition for arbitration, the petitioners shall provide all relevant documentation concerning the issue on which it is alleged that the board is deadlocked and the positions of the petitioners and the other members of the governing board with respect to the issue. The Commission shall conduct the arbitration proceeding in accordance with its Rules of Practice and Procedure (5VAC5-20-10 et seq.). The Commission's consideration shall be limited to the issue in the petition. The Commission shall proceed promptly with the hearing and determination of the issue in controversy. The final order of the Commission shall be final and binding on the multistate entity and the governing board, unless notice of appeal to the Supreme Court is filed in the office of the Clerk of the Commission within 30 days after entry of the order appealed from, in the manner provided in the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.
