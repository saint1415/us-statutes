Every notification center shall be certified by the Commission. The Commission shall determine the optimum number of notification centers in the Commonwealth. If the Commission determines that there shall be more than one notification center in the Commonwealth, it shall define the geographic area to be served by each notification center.\n\nC. Any corporation desiring to serve as the notification center for an area of the Commonwealth may apply to the Commission to be certified as the notification center for that area. The Commission shall have authority to grant, amend, or revoke certificates under regulations promulgated relating to certification. An application for certification shall include such information as the Commission may reasonably require addressing the applicant's operational plan for the notification center.\n\nD. Every Commission action regarding the optimum number of notification centers, the geographic area to be served by each notification center, the promulgation of notification center certification regulations, and the grant, amendment, or revocation of notification center certifications shall be made in furtherance of the purpose of preventing or mitigating loss of, or damage to, life, health, property or essential public services resulting from damage to underground utility lines.

      "text": "A. No person shall make or begin any excavation or demolition without first submitting a locate request to the notification center. Submission of a locate request shall be deemed to be notice to each operator who is a member of the notification center. The notification center shall provide the excavator with the identity of utilities that will be notified of the proposed excavation or demolition. Except for counties, cities, and towns, an excavator who willfully fails to submit a locate request for a proposed excavation or demolition shall be liable to the operator whose facilities are damaged by that excavator, for three times the cost to repair the damaged property, provided that the operator is a member of the notification center. The total amount of punitive damages awarded under this section, as distinguished from actual damages, shall not exceed $10,000 in any single cause of action.\n\nB. Except in the case of an emergency as defined in § 56-265.15 or in cases subject to subsection C, the excavator shall only commence work:\n\n1. After the excavator has confirmed, by reviewing the positive response information posted on the notification center's positive response system, that each operator has marked its utility lines, notified the notification center that its utility lines are not present in the area of proposed excavation, or otherwise posted a positive response indicating excavation may begin; or\n\n2. If informed by the notification center that no operators are to be notified.\n\nIf any operator fails to respond to the positive response system as required by this chapter, the notification center shall renotify any operator of its failure. This renotification shall not constitute an exemption from the duties of the operator set forth in § 56-265.19.\n\nC. If, after at least 48 hours beginning with 7:00 a.m. the next working day following a locate request or on the date of excavation, the excavator, upon arrival at the site of a proposed excavation, observes clear evidence of the presence of an unmarked utility line in the area of the proposed excavation, the excavator shall not begin excavating until three hours after an additional contact is made to the notification center for the area, provided that no information has been posted to the positive response system or information posted to the positive response system is inconsistent with the clear evidence observed by the excavator.\n\nThe operator of any unmarked utility line shall respond within three hours of the excavator's contact to the notification center. After the clear evidence of an unmarked utility line is addressed pursuant to the additional contact to the notification center, excavation may proceed. During any excavation subject to this subsection, the excavator shall exercise reasonable care at all times to protect underground utility lines and shall be liable for any damages.\n\nD. The excavator's notification shall be valid for 15 working days from 7:00 a.m. on the next working day following a locate request or 15 working days following a scheduled excavation date provided to the notification center, whichever is later. Three working days before the end of the 15-working-day period, or at any time when line-location markings on the ground become illegible, the excavator intending to excavate shall contact the notification center and request the re-marking of lines. The operator shall re-mark the lines as soon as possible; however, the re-marking of the lines shall be completed within 48 hours from 7:00 a.m. on the next working day following the request for the re-mark. Such re-marking shall be valid for an additional 15 working days from 7:00 a.m. on the next working day following a locate request.\n\nE. If a specific location of the excavation cannot be given as required by subdivision 2 of § 56-265.18, prior to notifying the notification center pursuant to subsection A, the person proposing to excavate or demolish shall mark the route or boundary of the site of the proposed excavation or demolition by means of white paint, if practical.\n\nF. The extent of the excavator's proposed excavation or demolition shall be a work area that can be excavated within 15 working days from 7:00 a.m. on the next working day following a locate request.

Provide copies of the best reasonably available records regarding the location of the private sewer laterals by electronic message, mail, facsimile, or other delivery method. If an excavation affects 25 or more private sewer laterals, the sewer system operator's response shall be in accordance with the timelines set forth in § 56-265.17:3. If the provision of records required by this subsection imposes an unreasonable burden or substantial cost upon a sewer system operator, the excavator and the sewer system operator shall endeavor in good faith to reach an agreement to provide the sewer system operator with additional time to provide the records or any other mutually agreeable accommodation.\n\nb. Provide the best reasonably available records on the Internet or another readily accessible electronic system in order that the records may be retrieved by the excavator from a remote location. If the sewer system operator has implemented such a system, then the sewer system operator shall have no further obligations to provide records under subdivision C 1 a.\n\nc. If the sewer system operator has no such records, but has additional information to provide about the location of private sewer laterals, then the sewer system operator shall notify the excavator of such information and, upon request, either meet with the excavator on-site or convey such information to the excavator.\n\n2. When the records have been made available in accordance with subdivision C 1 and the excavator reasonably concludes that a private sewer lateral may be impacted by the planned excavation based upon visual evidence, knowledge of the proposed excavation site, or other information available to the excavator, the excavator shall exercise reasonable care to protect the private sewer lateral. For purposes of this subdivision, reasonable care includes the following actions:\n\na. Reviewing information provided by the sewer system operator;\n\nb. Reviewing information provided by the private sewer lateral owner;\n\nc. Meeting with the sewer system operator on-site if the sewer system operator has additional information to provide about the location of private sewer laterals; or\n\nd. Conducting a visual inspection of the proposed excavation site in an effort to determine the probable path of the sewer lateral.\n\nD. Sewer system operators shall mark utility lines, other than sewer system laterals and private sewer laterals, as provided by other sections of this chapter.\n\nE. Water system operators shall mark water system utility lines as provided by other sections of this chapter, except that a water system operator shall not be responsible for marking private water laterals.\n\nF. Records regarding the location of private sewer laterals provided on the Internet or otherwise made accessible by an electronic system pursuant to subdivision C 1 b shall also be accessible to other public utilities and cable operators or excavators working on their behalf for purposes of compliance with this chapter.\n\nG. In all excavations, the excavator shall exercise reasonable care to protect underground utility lines.\n\n2010, c. 205.",
