After default, a secured party has the rights provided in this part and, except as otherwise provided in § 8.9A-602, those provided by agreement of the parties. A secured party:\n\n(1) may reduce a claim to judgment, foreclose, or otherwise enforce the claim, security interest, or agricultural lien by any available judicial procedure; and\n\n(2) if the collateral is documents, may proceed either as to the documents or as to the goods they cover.\n\n(b) Rights and duties of secured party in possession or control. A secured party in possession of collateral or control of collateral under § 8.7-106, 8.9A-104, 8.9A-105, 8.9A-105.1, 8.9A-106, 8.9A-107, or 8.9A-107.1 has the rights and duties provided in § 8.9A-207.\n\n(c) Rights cumulative; simultaneous exercise.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g) and § 8.9A-605, after default, a debtor and an obligor have the rights provided in this part and by agreement of the parties.\n\n(e) Lien of levy after judgment. If a secured party has reduced its claim to judgment, the lien of any levy that may be made upon the collateral by virtue of an execution based upon the judgment relates back to the earliest of:\n\n(1) the date of perfection of the security interest or agricultural lien in the collateral;\n\n(2) the date of filing a financing statement covering the collateral; or\n\n(3) any date specified in a statute under which the agricultural lien was created.\n\n(f) Execution sale. A sale pursuant to an execution is a foreclosure of the security interest or agricultural lien by judicial procedure within the meaning of this section. A secured party may purchase at the sale and thereafter hold the collateral free of any other requirements of this title.\n\n(g) Consignor or buyer of certain rights to payment. Except as otherwise provided in § 8.9A-607 (c), this part imposes no duties upon a secured party that is a consignor or is a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-501; 1973, c. 509; 2000, c. 1007; 2004, c. 200; 2024, c. 652.",

A secured party shall apply or pay over for application the cash proceeds of disposition under § 8.9A-610 in the following order to:\n\n(1) the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing, and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;\n\n(2) the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made;\n\n(3) the satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate security interest in or other subordinate lien on the collateral if:\n\n(A) the secured party receives from the holder of the subordinate security interest or other lien a signed demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed; and\n\n(B) in a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor; and\n\n(4) a secured party that is a consignor of the collateral if the secured party receives from the consignor a signed demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed.\n\n(b) Proof of subordinate interest. If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time. Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under subsection (a) (3).\n\n(c) Application of noncash proceeds. A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under § 8.9A-610 unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable. A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\n(d) Surplus or deficiency if obligation secured. If the security interest under which a disposition is made secures payment or performance of an obligation, after making the payments and applications required by subsection (a) and permitted by subsection (c):\n\n(1) unless subsection (a) (4) requires the secured party to apply or pay over cash proceeds to a consignor, the secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus; and\n\n(2) the obligor is liable for any deficiency.\n\n(e) No surplus or deficiency in sales of certain rights to payment. If the underlying transaction is a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes:\n\n(1) the debtor is not entitled to any surplus; and\n\n(2) the obligor is not liable for any deficiency.\n\n(f) Calculation of surplus or deficiency in disposition to person related to secured party. The surplus or deficiency following a disposition is calculated based on the amount of proceeds that would have been realized in a disposition complying with this part to a transferee other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor if:\n\n(1) the transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor; and\n\n(2) the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-504; 1973, c. 509; 2000, c. 1007; 2024, c. 652.",

In a consumer-goods transaction in which the debtor is entitled to a surplus or a consumer obligor is liable for a deficiency under § 8.9A-615, the secured party shall:\n\n(1) send an explanation to the debtor or consumer obligor, as applicable, after the disposition and:\n\n(A) before or when the secured party accounts to the debtor and pays any surplus or first makes demand in a record on the consumer obligor after the disposition for payment of the deficiency; and\n\n(B) within fourteen days after receipt of a request; or\n\n(2) in the case of a consumer obligor who is liable for a deficiency, within fourteen days after receipt of a request, send to the consumer obligor a record waiving the secured party's right to a deficiency.\n\n(c) Required information. To comply with subsection (a) (1) (B), an explanation must provide the following information in the following order:\n\n(1) the aggregate amount of obligations secured by the security interest under which the disposition was made, and, if the amount reflects a rebate of unearned interest or credit service charge, an indication of that fact, calculated as of a specified date:\n\n(A) if the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral after default, not more than thirty-five days before the secured party takes or receives possession; or\n\n(B) if the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral before default or does not take possession of the collateral, not more than thirty-five days before the disposition;\n\n(2) the amount of proceeds of the disposition;\n\n(3) the aggregate amount of the obligations after deducting the amount of proceeds;\n\n(4) the amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of expenses, including expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing of the collateral, and attorney's fees secured by the collateral which are known to the secured party and relate to the current disposition;\n\n(5) the amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of credits, including rebates of interest or credit service charges, to which the obligor is known to be entitled and which are not reflected in the amount in paragraph (1); and\n\n(6) the amount of the surplus or deficiency.\n\n(d) Substantial compliance. A particular phrasing of the explanation is not required. An explanation complying substantially with the requirements of subsection (a) is sufficient, even if it includes minor errors that are not seriously misleading.\n\n(e) Charges for responses. A debtor or consumer obligor is entitled without charge to one response to a request under this section during any six-month period in which the secured party did not send to the debtor or consumer obligor an explanation pursuant to subsection (b) (1). The secured party may require payment of a charge not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each additional response.\n\n2000, c. 1007; 2024, c. 652.",
