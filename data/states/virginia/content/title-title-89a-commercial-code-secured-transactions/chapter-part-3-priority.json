A security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to the rights of:\n\n(1) a person entitled to priority under § 8.9A-322; and\n\n(2) except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a person that becomes a lien creditor before the earlier of the time:\n\n(A) the security interest or agricultural lien is perfected; or\n\n(B) one of the conditions specified in subdivision (b)(3) of § 8.9A-203 is met and a financing statement covering the collateral is filed.\n\n(b) Buyers that receive delivery. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer, other than a secured party, of goods, instruments, tangible documents, or a certificated security takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected.\n\n(c) Lessees that receive delivery. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a lessee of goods takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the lessee gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected.\n\n(d) Licensees and buyers of certain collateral. Subject to subsections (f) through (i), a licensee of a general intangible or a buyer, other than a secured party, of collateral other than electronic money, goods, instruments, tangible documents, or a certificated security takes free of a security interest if the licensee or buyer gives value without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected.\n\n(e) Purchase-money security interest. Except as otherwise provided in §§ 8.9A-320 and 8.9A-321, if a person files a financing statement with respect to a purchase-money security interest before or within twenty days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer, lessee, or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing.\n\n(f) Buyers of chattel paper. A buyer, other than a secured party, of chattel paper takes free of a security interest if, without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected, the buyer gives value and:\n\n(1) receives delivery of each authoritative tangible copy of the record evidencing the chattel paper; and\n\n(2) if each authoritative electronic copy of the record evidencing the chattel paper can be subjected to control under § 8.9A-105, obtains control of each authoritative electronic copy.\n\n(g) Buyers of electronic documents. A buyer of an electronic document takes free of a security interest if, without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected, the buyer gives value and, if each authoritative electronic copy of the document can be subjected to control under § 8.7-106, obtains control of each authoritative electronic copy.\n\n(h) Buyers of controllable electronic records.

A buyer, other than a secured party, of a controllable account or a controllable payment intangible takes free of a security interest if, without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected, the buyer gives value and obtains control of the controllable account or controllable payment intangible.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-301; 1973, c. 509; 1983, c. 204; 1991, c. 536, § 8.2A-307; 1996, c. 216; 2000, c. 1007; 2004, c. 200; 2012, c. 155; 2024, c. 652.",

Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.\n\n(2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.\n\n(3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.\n\n(b) Time of perfection; proceeds and supporting obligations. For the purposes of subsection (a) (1):\n\n(1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and\n\n(2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.\n\n(c) Special priority rules: proceeds and supporting obligations.

Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.\n\n(f) Limitations on subsections (a) through (e). Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:\n\n(1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;\n\n(2) § 8.4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank;\n\n(3) § 8.5A-118 with respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person; and\n\n(4) § 8.9A-110 with respect to a security interest arising under Title 8.2 or Title 8.2A.\n\n(g) Priority under agricultural lien statute.

This title does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.\n\n(c) General rule; subordination of security interest in fixtures. In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.\n\n(d) Fixtures purchase-money priority.

A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.\n\n(i) Priority of security interest in crops.
