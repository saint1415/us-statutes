      "text": "(a) Attachment. A security interest attaches to collateral when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, unless an agreement expressly postpones the time of attachment.\n\n(b) Enforceability. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) through (i), a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if:\n\n(1) value has been given;\n\n(2) the debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party; and\n\n(3) one of the following conditions is met:\n\n(A) the debtor has signed a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned;\n\n(B) the collateral is not a certificated security and is in the possession of the secured party under § 8.9A-313 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement;\n\n(C) the collateral is a certificated security in registered form and the security certificate has been delivered to the secured party under § 8.8A-301 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement;\n\n(D) the collateral is controllable accounts, controllable electronic records, controllable payment intangibles, deposit accounts, electronic documents, electronic money, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights, and the secured party has control under § 8.7-106, 8.9A-104, 8.9A-105, 8.9A-105.1, 8.9A-106, 8.9A-107, or 8.9A-107.1 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement; or\n\n(E) the collateral is chattel paper and the secured party has possession and control under § 8.9A-314.1 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.\n\n(c) Other Uniform Commercial Code provisions. Subsection (b) is subject to § 8.4-210 on the security interest of a collecting bank, § 8.5A-118 on the security interest of a letter-of-credit issuer or nominated person, § 8.9A-110 on a security interest arising under Title 8.2 or Title 8.2A, and § 8.9A-206 on security interests in investment property.\n\n(d) When person becomes bound by another person's security agreement. A person becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person if, by operation of law other than this title or by contract:\n\n(1) the security agreement becomes effective to create a security interest in the person's property; or\n\n(2) the person becomes generally obligated for the obligations of the other person, including the obligation secured under the security agreement, and acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets of the other person.\n\n(e) Effect of new debtor becoming bound. If a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person:\n\n(1) the agreement satisfies subdivision (b) (3) with respect to existing or after-acquired property of the new debtor to the extent the property is described in the agreement; and\n\n(2) another agreement is not necessary to make a security interest in the property enforceable.\n\n(f) Proceeds and supporting obligations. The attachment of a security interest in collateral gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by § 8.9A-315 and is also attachment of a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral.\n\n(g) Lien securing right to payment. The attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real property is also attachment of a security interest in the security interest, mortgage, or other lien.\n\n(h) Security entitlement carried in securities account. The attachment of a security interest in a securities account is also attachment of a security interest in the security entitlements carried in the securities account.\n\n(i) Commodity contracts carried in commodity account. The attachment of a security interest in a commodity account is also attachment of a security interest in the commodity contracts carried in the commodity account.\n\nCode 1950, § 6-551; 1964, c. 219, § 8.9-203; 1973, c. 509; 1984, c. 613; 1996, c. 216, § 8.9-115; 2000, c. 1007; 2004, c. 200; 2024, c. 652.",

Subsection (b) does not prevent a security interest from attaching:\n\n(1) to consumer goods as proceeds under § 8.9A-315 (a) or commingled goods under § 8.9A-336 (c);\n\n(2) to a commercial tort claim as proceeds under § 8.9A-315 (a); or\n\n(3) under an after-acquired property clause to property that is proceeds of consumer goods or a commercial tort claim.\n\n(c) Future advances and other value. A security agreement may provide that collateral secures, or that accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes are sold in connection with, future advances or other value, whether or not the advances or value are given pursuant to commitment.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-204; 1973, c. 509; 2000, c. 1007; 2024, c. 652.",

Where the unpaid debts from two or more sales of consumer goods are consolidated into one debt payable on a single schedule of payments, and the consolidated debt is secured by security interests in the consumer goods sold, the payments made by the debtor under the consolidated schedule may be applied to the payment of the debts arising from the sales either (1) in the order in which the sales were made, starting with the first sale, or (2) in the same proportion as the original debts arising from the various sales bear to one another. To the extent debts are paid according to this section, security interests in the consumer goods sold will terminate as the debt originally incurred with respect to each item is paid.\n\n(b) This section shall not apply to a sale of consumer goods purchased pursuant to an open-end credit plan, when previously purchased consumer goods were purchased pursuant to such plan. This section shall not apply to a security interest in a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which may be the subject of a certificate of title under Title 46.2.\n\n(c) A security interest created in violation of this section is void.\n\n2000, c. 1007.",
