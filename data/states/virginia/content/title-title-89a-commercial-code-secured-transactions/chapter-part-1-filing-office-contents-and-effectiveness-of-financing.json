The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the State Corporation Commission. The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures.\n\n1996, c. 216, § 8.9-401; 2000, c. 1007.",

Except as otherwise provided in § 8.9A-501 (b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (a) and also:\n\n(1) indicate that it covers this type of collateral;\n\n(2) indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records;\n\n(3) provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this state if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property; and\n\n(4) if the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner.\n\n(c) Record of mortgage as financing statement. A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:\n\n(1) the record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;\n\n(2) the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;\n\n(3) the record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section, but:\n\n(A) the record need not indicate that it is to be filed in the real property records; and\n\n(B) the record sufficiently provides the name of a debtor who is an individual if it provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor, even if the debtor is an individual to whom § 8.9A-503(a)(4) applies; and\n\n(4) the record is duly recorded.\n\n(d) Filing before security agreement or attachment.

A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:\n\n(1) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name;\n\n(2) subject to subsection (f), if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;\n\n(3) if the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:\n\n(A) provides, as the name of the debtor:\n\n(i) if the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified; or\n\n(ii) if the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and\n\n(B) in a separate part of the financing statement:\n\n(i) if the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i), indicates that the collateral is held in trust; or\n\n(ii) if the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;\n\n(4) subject to subsection (g), if the debtor is an individual to whom the Commonwealth has issued a driver's license or other document under Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of Title 46.2 that has not expired, only if it provides the name of the individual which is indicated on the driver's license or other document;\n\n(5) if the debtor is an individual to whom paragraph (4) does not apply, only if it provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and\n\n(6) in other cases:\n\n(A) if the debtor has a name, only if it provides the organizational name of the debtor; and\n\n(B) if the debtor does not have a name, only if it provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor, in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.\n\n(b) Additional debtor-related information. A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:\n\n(1) a trade name or other name of the debtor; or\n\n(2) unless required under subsection (a)(6)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.\n\n(c) Debtor's trade name insufficient. A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.\n\n(d) Representative capacity. Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.\n\n(e) Multiple debtors and secured parties. A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.\n\n(f) Name of decedent. The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the \"name of the decedent\" under subsection (a)(2).\n\n(g) Multiple driver's licenses. If the Commonwealth has issued to an individual more than one driver's license or other document of a kind described in subsection (a)(4), the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (a)(4) refers.\n\n(h) Definition. In this section, the \"name of the settlor or testator\" means:\n\n(1) if the settlor is a registered organization, the name of the registered organization indicated on the public organic record filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization; or\n\n(2) in other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust's organic record.\n\n2000, c. 1007; 2009, cc. 217, 610; 2012, c. 155; 2020, cc. 1227, 1246.",

This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under § 8.9A-311 (b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation.

      "text": "(a) Five-year effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing.\n\n(b) Public-finance or manufactured-home transaction. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of thirty years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction.\n\n(c) Lapse and continuation of financing statement. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.\n\n(d) When continuation statement may be filed. A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the thirty-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable.\n\n(e) Effect of filing continuation statement. Except as otherwise provided in § 8.9A-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.\n\n(f) Transmitting utility financing statement. If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.\n\n(g) Record of mortgage as financing statement. A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under § 8.9A-502 (c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-403; 1973, c. 509; 1975, c. 225; 1976, c. 536; 1977, c. 539; 1978, c. 284; 1982, c. 652; 1984, cc. 40, 771; 1985, c. 297; 1988, c. 804; 1990, cc. 89, 412; 1992, c. 784; 2000, c. 1007; 2012, c. 155.",

Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because:\n\n(1) the record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office;\n\n(2) an amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered;\n\n(3) the filing office is unable to index the record because:\n\n(A) in the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor;\n\n(B) in the case of an amendment or information statement, the record:\n\n(i) does not identify the initial financing statement as required by § 8.9A-512 or 8.9A-518, as applicable;\n\n(ii) identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under § 8.9A-515; or\n\n(iii) in the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in § 8.9A-501(a)(1), does not provide the name and mailing address of the debtor;\n\n(C) in the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's surname; or\n\n(D) in the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in § 8.9A-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates;\n\n(4) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record;\n\n(5) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not:\n\n(A) provide a mailing address for the debtor; or\n\n(B) indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization;\n\n(6) in the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under § 8.9A-514(a) or an amendment filed under § 8.9A-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee;\n\n(7) in the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by § 8.9A-515(d); or\n\n(8) in the case of an initial financing statement or amendment communicated to the office of the State Corporation Commission, it appears to such office that the record:\n\n(A) is not created pursuant to this title;\n\n(B) is presented for filing for an improper purpose, such as to hinder, harass, or otherwise wrongfully interfere with a person or promote or conduct an illegitimate object or purpose;\n\n(C) is materially false or fraudulent; or\n\n(D) indicates that the debtor and the secured party are substantially the same person or that an individual debtor is a transmitting utility.\n\n(c) Rules applicable to subsection (b). For purposes of subsection (b):\n\n(1) a record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information;\n\n(2) a record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by § 8.9A-512, 8.9A-514, or 8.9A-518, is an initial financing statement; and\n\n(3) if the filing office becomes aware that a record may have been wrongfully filed because it should have been rejected under subdivision (b)(8), the filing office may review the record and relevant circumstances and, if it determines that the record was wrongfully filed and should have been rejected under subdivision (b)(8):\n\n(A) the record shall be deemed void and ineffective; and\n\n(B) the filing office shall remove the record from the index and communicate the foregoing to the person that presented the wrongfully filed record and to other persons, as appropriate.\n\n(d) Refusal to accept record; record effective as filed record. A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files.\n\n2000, c. 1007; 2002, cc. 566, 644; 2012, c. 155; 2013, c. 757",
