Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 8.9A-309, a security interest is perfected if it has attached and all of the applicable requirements for perfection in §§ 8.9A-310 through 8.9A-316 have been satisfied. A security interest is perfected when it attaches if the applicable requirements are satisfied before the security interest attaches.\n\n(b) Perfection of agricultural lien. An agricultural lien is perfected if it has become effective and all of the applicable requirements for perfection in § 8.9A-310 have been satisfied. An agricultural lien is perfected when it becomes effective if the applicable requirements are satisfied before the agricultural lien becomes effective.\n\n(c) Continuous perfection; perfection by different methods. A security interest or agricultural lien is perfected continuously if it is originally perfected by one method under this title and is later perfected by another method under this title, without an intermediate period when it was unperfected.\n\n(d) Supporting obligation. Perfection of a security interest in collateral also perfects a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral.\n\n(e) Lien securing right to payment. Perfection of a security interest in a right to payment or performance also perfects a security interest in a security interest, mortgage, or other lien on personal or real property securing the right.\n\n(f) Security entitlement carried in securities account. Perfection of a security interest in a securities account also perfects a security interest in the security entitlements carried in the securities account.\n\n(g) Commodity contract carried in commodity account.

With respect to collateral other than certificated securities and goods covered by a document, a secured party takes possession of collateral in the possession of a person other than the debtor, the secured party, or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business, when:\n\n(1) the person in possession signs a record acknowledging that it holds possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit; or\n\n(2) the person takes possession of the collateral after having signed a record acknowledging that it will hold possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit.\n\n(d) Time of perfection by possession; continuation of perfection.

A secured party does not relinquish possession, even if a delivery under subsection (h) violates the rights of a debtor.

If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.\n\n(c) Possessory security interest in collateral moved to new jurisdiction.

The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:\n\n(1) A financing statement filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in § 8.9A-301 (1) or 8.9A-305 (c) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the debtor had not changed its location.\n\n(2) If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective under paragraph (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in § 8.9A-301 (1) or 8.9A-305 (c) or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.\n\n(i) Effect of change in governing law on financing statement filed against original debtor. If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in § 8.9A-301 (1) or 8.9A-305 (c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights before or within four months after the new debtor becomes bound under § 8.9A-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the collateral had been acquired by the original debtor.\n\n(2) A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement and which becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the expiration of the four-month period or the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in § 8.9A-301 (1) or 8.9A-305 (c) remains perfected thereafter. A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.\n\nCode 1950, § 55-9; 1964, c. 219, § 8.9-103; 1973, c. 509; 1984, c. 613; 1996, c. 216; 1997, c. 343; 2000, c. 1007; 2012, c. 155; 2024, c. 652.",
