      "text": "(a) Definitions. In this section:\n\n(1) \"purchase-money collateral\" means goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral; and\n\n(2) \"purchase-money obligation\" means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.\n\n(b) Purchase-money security interest in goods. A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest:\n\n(1) to the extent that the goods are purchase-money collateral with respect to that security interest;\n\n(2) if the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase-money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest; and\n\n(3) also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.\n\n(c) Purchase-money security interest in software. A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if:\n\n(1) the debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods; and\n\n(2) the debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.\n\n(d) Consignor's inventory purchase-money security interest. The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase-money security interest in inventory.\n\n(e) Application of payment in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, if the extent to which a security interest is a purchase-money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied:\n\n(1) in accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree;\n\n(2) in the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment; or\n\n(3) in the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order:\n\n(A) to obligations that are not secured; and\n\n(B) if more than one obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase-money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred.\n\n(f) No loss of status of purchase-money security interest in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a purchase-money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if:\n\n(1) the purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation;\n\n(2) collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation; or\n\n(3) the purchase-money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated, or restructured.\n\n(g) Burden of proof in nonconsumer-goods transaction. In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest.\n\n(h) Nonconsumer-goods transactions; no inference. The limitation of the rules in subsections (e), (f), and (g) to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.\n\n(i) Goods covered by negotiable document. The attachment of a security interest in a negotiable document is also attachment of a security interest in the goods covered by the negotiable document.\n\n1964, c. 219, § 8.9-107; 2000, c. 1007.",

A secured party has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the assignment of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the purchaser as the person to which the authoritative electronic copy was assigned.\n\n(b) Single authoritative copy. A system satisfies subsection (a) if the record or records evidencing the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in a manner that:\n\n(1) a single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;\n\n(2) the authoritative copy identifies the purchaser as the assignee of the record or records;\n\n(3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the purchaser or its designated custodian;\n\n(4) copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the purchaser;\n\n(5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and\n\n(6) any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.\n\n(c) One or more authoritative copies. A system satisfies subsection (a), and a purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper, if the electronic copy, a record attached to or logically associated with the electronic copy, or a system in which the electronic copy is recorded:\n\n(1) enables the purchaser readily to identify each electronic copy as either an authoritative copy or a nonauthoritative copy;\n\n(2) enables the purchaser readily to identify itself in any way, including by name, identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number, as the assignee of the authoritative electronic copy; and\n\n(3) gives the purchaser exclusive power, subject to subsection (d), to:\n\n(A) prevent others from adding or changing an identified assignee of the authoritative electronic copy; and\n\n(B) transfer control of the authoritative electronic copy.\n\n(d) Meaning of exclusive. Subject to subsection (e), a power is exclusive under subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B) even if:\n\n(1) the authoritative electronic copy, a record attached to or logically associated with the authoritative electronic copy, or a system in which the authoritative electronic copy is recorded limits the use of the authoritative electronic copy or has a protocol programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control; or\n\n(2) the power is shared with another person.\n\n(e) When power not shared with another person. A power of a purchaser is not shared with another person under subsection (d)(2) and the purchaser's power is not exclusive if:\n\n(1) the purchaser can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised by the other person; and\n\n(2) the other person:\n\n(A) can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the purchaser; or\n\n(B) is the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper.\n\n(f) Presumption of exclusivity of certain powers. If a purchaser has the powers specified in subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B), the powers are presumed to be exclusive.\n\n(g) Obtaining control through another person. A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if another person, other than the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper:\n\n(1) has control of the authoritative electronic copy and acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser; or\n\n(2) obtains control of the authoritative electronic copy after having acknowledged that it will obtain control of the electronic copy on behalf of the purchaser.\n\n2000, c. 1007; 2012, c. 155; 2024, c. 652.",
