Before approving any site for the placement of C. ariakensis, the Commissioner shall determine that such use of the site shall not conflict with Virginia's native oyster restoration program. The Commissioner shall not approve any submerged aquatic vegetation site designated pursuant to § 28.2-1204.1 for the placement of C. ariakensis. Sites designated and approved for the placement of C. ariakensis shall be marked as provided in § 28.2-517 or as otherwise specified by the Commissioner in granting the authorization.\n\n2. C. ariakensis oysters placed on state-owned bottomlands pursuant to this section shall not be relayed or transferred to other state-owned bottomlands except in compliance with this section.\n\n3. C. ariakensis oysters placed on state-owned bottomlands pursuant to this section shall originate at a hatchery located in the Chesapeake Bay region and be certified by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to be currently in compliance with applicable protocols established by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Documentation of compliance with this requirement shall be submitted to the Commissioner prior to the placement of such oysters on state-owned bottomlands pursuant to this section.\n\n4. C. ariakensis oysters placed in state-owned bottomlands pursuant to this section prior to July 1, 2007, or the completion of the Environmental Impact Statement under preparation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and sponsored by Maryland and Virginia concerning the introduction of nonnative oysters, whichever is sooner, shall be rendered incapable of reproduction by a method that has been determined by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science as reliably producing not more than one diploid oyster per 1,000 of triploid oysters produced, and shall be deployed in a manner determined by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to protect against inadvertent fertilization. On and after July 1, 2007, or the completion of the Environmental Impact Statement under preparation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and sponsored by Maryland and Virginia concerning the introduction of nonnative oysters, whichever is sooner, the Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Director of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, may authorize the placement of diploid or fertile C. ariakensis oysters on state-owned bottomlands.\n\nC.

Requests for approval and accompanying certifications required by this section shall be submitted in such form as prescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may, by regulation, establish a reasonable fee sufficient to defray the costs of processing requests for approval. Approvals granted pursuant to this section shall not be transferred without the written authorization of the Commissioner.\n\nE. C. ariakensis oysters that are placed on state-owned bottomlands in violation of this section shall, upon written order of the Commissioner, be removed immediately by the person responsible for their placement.
