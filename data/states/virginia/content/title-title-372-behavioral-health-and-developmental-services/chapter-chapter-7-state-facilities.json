The Department may assess or contract with any individual receiving services or the parent, guardian, conservator, trustee, or other person liable for his support and maintenance to recover care, treatment or training, and maintenance expenses. In arriving at the amount to be paid, the Department shall have due regard for the financial condition and estate of the individual, his present and future needs, and the present and future needs of his lawful dependents. Whenever it is deemed necessary to protect him or his dependents, the Department may assess or agree to accept a monthly sum for the individual's care, treatment or training, and maintenance that is less than the actual per diem cost, provided that the estate of the individual other than income shall not be depleted below the sum of $500. Nothing contained in this title shall be construed as making any such contract permanently binding upon the Department or prohibiting it from periodically reevaluating the actual per diem cost of care, treatment or training, and maintenance and the financial condition and estate of any individual receiving services, his present and future needs, and the present and future needs of his lawful dependents and entering into a new agreement with the individual or the parent, guardian, conservator, trustee, or other person liable for his support and maintenance, increasing or decreasing the sum to be paid for the individual's care, treatment or training, and maintenance.\n\nC.

When any individual receiving services or his guardian, conservator, trustee, or other person liable for his expenses fails to pay those expenses and it appears from investigation that the individual, his guardian, conservator, trustee, or other person liable for his support is able or has sufficient estate to pay the expenses, the Department shall petition the appropriate court having jurisdiction over the estate of the individual or the court for the county or city in which the individual resides or from which he was admitted to a state facility for an order to compel payment of the expenses by the person liable therefor. In any case in which a person liable for the support of the individual is being proceeded against, the petition shall be directed to the appropriate court of the county or city in which the person liable for the support of the individual resides.\n\nB. The individual receiving services and his estate shall first be liable for the payment of his expenses and thereafter, the person liable for the support of the individual. Such person shall be the father, mother, husband, wife, or child of the individual who has attained the age of majority. Multiple persons shall be jointly and severally liable. The Department shall collect part or all of the expenses from the several sources as appears proper under the circumstances and may proceed against all sources, except that the principal or income or both from a trust created for the benefit of the individual shall be liable for payment only as provided in Article 5 (§ 64.2-742 et seq.) of the Uniform Trust Code. In evaluating the circumstances, the Department may consider any events related to the admission of the individual for treatment or training that have affected the person liable, such as the infliction of serious injury by the individual on the person who is liable. The proceedings for the collection of expenses shall conform to the procedure for collection of debts due the Commonwealth.\n\nC. Notice of any hearing on the petition of the Department for an order to compel payment of expenses shall be served at least 15 days prior to the hearing and in the manner provided for the service of civil process on the individual receiving services and, if there is one, on his guardian, conservator, or trustee, on the other person legally responsible for the individual's support, or on the person against whom the proceedings are instituted.\n\nD. At the hearing, the court shall hear the allegations and proofs of the parties and shall by order require full or partial payment of maintenance by the liable parties, if they have sufficient ability, having due regard for the financial condition and estate of the individual receiving services or any other person liable for his expenses, his present and future needs, and the present and future needs of his lawful dependents, if the proceeding is to charge the individual or any other person liable with such expenses.\n\nE.
