Any such financing statement may be signed by either the debtor or the secured party. It must identify the security agreement, statement or notice (however denominated in any statute or other law repealed or modified by this act), state the office where and the date when the last filing, refiling or recording, if any, was made with respect thereto, and the filing number, if any, or book and page, if any, of recording and further state that the security agreement, statement or notice, however denominated, in another filing office under Title 8.9 or under any statute or other law repealed or modified by this act is still effective. Section 8.9-401 and § 8.9-103 determine the proper place to file such a financing statement. Except as specified in this subsection, the provisions of § 8.9-403 (3) for continuation statements apply to such a financing statement.\n\n1973, c. 509.",
