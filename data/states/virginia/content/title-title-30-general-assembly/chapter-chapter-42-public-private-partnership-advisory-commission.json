Each responsible public entity receiving detailed proposals from private entities for a qualifying project shall provide copies of such proposals to the Chairman of the Commission, the chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Finance, and Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations or their designees, and the Director of the Department of General Services prior to entering into the negotiation of an interim or comprehensive agreement.\n\nB.

Within 10 days of receipt of a complete copy of the detailed proposals for a qualifying project, the Commission shall determine whether to accept or decline such proposals for review and notify the responsible public entity of its decision.
