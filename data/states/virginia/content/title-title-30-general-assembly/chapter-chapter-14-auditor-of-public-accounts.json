      "text": "Whenever the General Assembly is not in session, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission may perform any of the duties of the Auditor of Public Accounts upon its determination that the Auditor is unable or unwilling to perform any of his duties by reason of incapacity, malfeasance in office, neglect of duty, conflict of interest, or criminal activity relating to the performance of his duties. Such action shall, after notice to the Auditor of Public Accounts and an opportunity to be heard, require a three-fifths vote of all Commission members and shall be effective until the House of Delegates, acting at the next regular or special session of the General Assembly, determines whether to institute impeachment proceedings against the Auditor, as provided in Article IV, Section 17 of the Constitution of Virginia or until the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, by a majority vote of its membership, determines that the Auditor of Public Accounts can resume the performance of his duties. Upon institution of impeachment proceedings by the House of Delegates, the Commission may continue to perform such duties until the conclusion of impeachment proceedings.\n\n1979, c. 441, § 2.1-155.2; 2001, c. 844.",
