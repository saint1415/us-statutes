At the end of a term, a nonlegislative citizen member shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed.

A majority of the Council shall constitute a quorum. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C, if any nonlegislative citizen member of the Council fails to attend a majority of meetings of the Council in a calendar year, the Council shall notify the member's appointing authority. Upon receipt of such notification, the appointing authority may remove the member and appoint a successor as soon as practicable.\n\nF.
