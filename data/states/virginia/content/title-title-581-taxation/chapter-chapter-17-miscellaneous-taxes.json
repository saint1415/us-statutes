      "text": "A. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:\n\n\"Access lines\" are defined to include residence and business telephone lines and other switched (packet or circuit) lines connecting the customer premises to the public switched telephone network for the transmission of outgoing voice-grade-capable telecommunications services. Centrex, PBX or other multistation telecommunications services will incur an E-911 tax charge on every line or trunk (Network Access Registrar or PBX trunk) that allows simultaneous unrestricted outward dialing to the public switched telephone network. ISDN Primary Rate Interface services will be charged five E-911 tax charges for every ISDN Primary Rate Interface network facility established by the customer. Other channelized services in which each voice-grade channel is controlled by the telecommunications provider shall be charged one tax for each line that allows simultaneous unrestricted outward dialing to the public switched telephone network. Access lines do not include local, state, and federal government lines; access lines used to provide service to users as part of the Virginia Universal Service Plan; interstate and intrastate dedicated WATS lines; special access lines; off-premises extensions; official lines internally provided and used by providers of telecommunications services for administrative, testing, intercept, coin, and verification purposes; and commercial mobile radio service.\n\n\"Automatic location identification\" or \"ALI\" means a telephone network capability that enables the automatic display of information defining the geographical location of the telephone used to place a wireline 9-1-1 call.\n\n\"Automatic number identification\" or \"ANI\" means a telephone network capability that enables the automatic display of the telephone number used to place a wireline 9-1-1 call.\n\n\"Centrex\" means a business telephone service offered by a local exchange company from a local central office; a normal single line telephone service with added custom calling features including but not limited to intercom, call forwarding, and call transfer.\n\n\"Communications services provider\" means the same as provided in § 58.1-647.\n\n\"Enhanced 9-1-1 service\" or \"E-911\" means a service consisting of telephone network features and PSAPs provided for users of telephone systems enabling users to reach a PSAP by dialing the digits \"9-1-1.\" Such service automatically directs 9-1-1 emergency telephone calls to the appropriate PSAPs by selective routing based on the geographical location from which the emergency call originated, and provides the capability for ANI and ALI features.\n\n\"ISDN Primary Rate Interface\" means 24 bearer channels, each of which is a full 64,000 bits per second. One of the channels is generally used to carry signaling information for the 23 other channels.\n\n\"Network Access Register\" means a central office register associated with Centrex service that is required in order to complete a call involving access to the public switched telephone network outside the confines of that Centrex company. Network Access Register may be incoming, outgoing, or two-way.\n\n\"PBX\" means public branch exchange and is telephone switching equipment owned by the customer and located on the customer's premises.\n\n\"PBX trunk\" means a connection of the customer's PBX switch to the central office.\n\n\"Public safety answering point\" or \"PSAP\" means a communications facility equipped and staffed on a 24-hour basis to receive and process 911 calls.\n\nB. There is hereby imposed a monthly tax of $0.75 on the end user of each access line of the telephone service or services provided by a communications services provider. However, no such tax shall be imposed on federal, state, and local government agencies or on consumers of CMRS, as that term is defined in § 56-484.12. The revenues shall be collected and remitted monthly by the communications services provider to the Department and deposited into the Communications Sales and Use Tax Trust Fund. This tax shall be subject to the notification and jurisdictional provisions of subsection C.\n\nC. If a customer believes that an amount of tax or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the communications services provider in writing. The customer shall include in this written notification the street address for the customer's place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, the account name and number for which the customer seeks a correction, a description of the error asserted by the customer, and any other information that the communications services provider reasonably requires to process the request. Within 15 days of receiving a notice under this section, the communications services provider shall review its records within an additional 15 days to determine the customer's taxing jurisdiction. If this review shows that the amount of tax or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is in error, the communications services provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to two years. If this review shows that the amount of tax or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, the communications services provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer. The procedures in this section shall be the first course of remedy available to customers seeking correction of assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, or a refund of or other compensation for taxes erroneously collected by the communications services provider, and no cause of action based upon a dispute arising from such taxes shall accrue until a customer has reasonably exercised the rights and procedures set forth in this subsection.\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, the terms \"customer\" and \"place of primary use\" shall have the same meanings provided in § 58.1-647.\n\nD. For the purpose of compensating a communications services provider for accounting for and remitting the tax levied by this section, each communications services provider shall be allowed 3% of the amount of tax revenues due and accounted for in the form of a deduction in submitting the return and remitting the amount due.\n\n2006, c. 780.",

There is hereby levied, in addition to all other taxes and fees of every kind now imposed by law, a tax upon the rental of a motor vehicle in Virginia, without regard to whether such vehicle is required to be licensed by the Commonwealth. However, such tax shall not be levied upon a rental to a person for re-rental as an established business or part of an established business, or incidental or germane to such business.\n\nThe amount of the tax to be collected shall be determined by the Tax Commissioner by the application of the following rates against the gross proceeds:\n\n1. Four percent of the gross proceeds from the rental in Virginia of any motor vehicle, except those with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross combination weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more.\n\n2. In addition to the tax levied pursuant to subdivision A 1, a tax of four percent of the gross proceeds shall be levied on the rental in Virginia of any daily rental vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is required to be licensed in the Commonwealth.\n\n3. In addition to all other applicable taxes and fees, a fee of two percent of the gross proceeds shall be imposed on the rental in Virginia of any daily rental vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is required to be licensed in the Commonwealth. For purposes of this article, the rental fee shall be implemented, enforced, and collected in the same manner that rental taxes are implemented, enforced, and collected.\n\nB.

Any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer exempt from this tax under subdivision 1 or 2 of § 58.1-1737 shall be subject to the tax when such vehicle is no longer rented by the United States government or any governmental agency thereof, or the Commonwealth of Virginia or any political subdivision thereof, unless at such time the vehicle is sold or its ownership is otherwise transferred, in which case the tax imposed by § 58.1-2402 shall apply, subject to the exemptions provided for in § 58.1-2403.\n\nD. There is hereby levied a tax upon peer-to-peer vehicle sharing, without regard to whether a shared vehicle is required to be licensed by the Commonwealth.\n\n1. Beginning July 1, 2020, and ending July 1, 2021, in lieu of the tax levied under subsection A, if a shared vehicle owner registers no more than 10 different shared vehicles on any combination of peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platforms at any one time, the tax shall be imposed at a rate of six and one-half percent on the gross proceeds paid by the shared vehicle driver for the peer-to-peer vehicle sharing in the Commonwealth of any shared vehicle.\n\n2. Beginning July 1, 2021, and thereafter, in lieu of the tax levied under subsection A, if a shared vehicle owner registers no more than 10 different shared vehicles on any combination of peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platforms at any one time, the tax shall be imposed at a rate of seven percent on the gross proceeds paid by the shared vehicle driver for the peer-to-peer vehicle sharing in the Commonwealth of any shared vehicle.\n\n3. However, if, and for so long as, a shared vehicle owner registers more than 10 different vehicles on any combination of peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platforms at any one time, the taxes levied on the gross proceeds paid by the shared vehicle driver shall be the same taxes imposed and collected on the rental of a motor vehicle and a daily rental vehicle pursuant to subdivisions A 1, 2, and 3.\n\nE. A peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform shall require all shared vehicle owners to certify to the peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform whether the shared vehicle owner or any affiliate or subsidiary has registered more than 10 different shared vehicles on any combination of platforms at any one time. A shared vehicle owner is under a continuing obligation to immediately notify all platforms upon which he has vehicles registered, if the registration of a shared vehicle on a platform by the shared vehicle owner will cause the shared vehicle owner to exceed 10 or more different shared vehicles registered on any combination of peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platforms at any one time. Such notification shall occur prior to sharing any additional shared vehicles on any platform, not including those already subject to a vehicle sharing platform agreement at the time the additional vehicle is registered with the platform by the shared vehicle owner. Failure by the shared vehicle owner to immediately notify any platform shall subject the shared vehicle owner to payment of the taxes due and applicable penalties. Any affirmation or notification by the shared vehicle owner of such certifications shall require the peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform to collect the taxes pursuant to subsection A.\n\n2011, cc. 405, 639; 2020, c. 1266.",
