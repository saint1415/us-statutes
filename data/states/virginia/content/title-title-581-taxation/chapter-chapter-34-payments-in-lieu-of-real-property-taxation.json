The assessed value of the Virginia Port Authority real property in each county, city, or town divided by the total assessed value of real property owned by the Virginia Port Authority in all counties, cities, or towns; and\n\n2. The Virginia Port Authority cargo tonnage shipped through each county, city, or town divided by the total Virginia Port Authority cargo tonnage shipped through all counties, cities, and towns.\n\nSuch service charge rate for each county, city, or town shall then be applied to the product of the total Virginia Port Authority cargo tonnage multiplied by $0.25.\n\nE.
