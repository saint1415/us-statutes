If the taxpayer has no place of business or residence within the Commonwealth, such memorandum may be filed in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond.

Such memorandum shall be recorded in the judgment docket book and shall have the effect of a judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, to be enforced as provided in Article 19 (§ 8.01-196 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01, except that a writ of fieri facias may issue at any time after the memorandum is filed. The lien on real estate shall become effective at the time the memorandum is filed in the jurisdiction in which the real estate is located. No memorandum of lien shall be filed unless the taxpayer is first given ten or more days' prior notice of intent to file a lien; however, in those instances where the Tax Commissioner determines that the collection of any tax, penalties or interest required to be paid pursuant to law will be jeopardized by the provision of such notice, notification may be provided to the taxpayer concurrent with the filing of the memorandum of lien. Such notice shall be given to the taxpayer at his last known address. For purposes of this section, \"last known address\" means the address shown on the most recent return filed by or on behalf of the taxpayer or the address provided in correspondence by or on behalf of the taxpayer indicating that it is a change of the taxpayer's address.\n\nB.

He shall also post notices of distraint on each of the doors so padlocked. If after three business days, the tax deficiency has not been satisfied or satisfactory arrangements for payment made, the Tax Commissioner may cause a writ of fieri facias to be issued.\n\nIt shall be a Class 1 misdemeanor for anyone to enter the padlocked premises without prior approval of the Tax Commissioner.\n\nIn the event that the taxpayer against whom the distraint has been applied subsequently makes application for correction of the assessment under § 58.1-1821, the taxpayer shall have the right to post bond equaling the amount of the tax liability in lieu of payment until the application is acted upon.\n\nThe provisions of subsection C shall be enforceable only after the promulgation, by the Tax Commissioner, of regulations under the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) setting forth the circumstances under which this subsection can be used.\n\nD. A taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Commissioner after a memorandum of lien has been filed under this section if the taxpayer alleges an error in the filing of the lien.

If no penalty is so prescribed, he shall assess a penalty of five percent of the tax due, or if the failure to pay in full was fraudulent, a penalty of 100 percent of the tax due. In addition thereto, interest on the outstanding tax and penalty shall be charged at the rate established under § 58.1-15 for the period between the due date and the date of full payment.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, the amount of tax shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed, whether such return was filed on or after the date prescribed, and no proceeding in court without assessment shall be begun for the collection of such tax after the expiration of such period.

Such interest shall accrue from a date sixty days after payment of the tax, or sixty days after the last day prescribed by law for such payment, whichever is later, and shall end on a date determined by the Department preceding the date of the refund check by not more than thirty days. Notwithstanding the above, any tax refunded pursuant to a court order or otherwise as a result of an erroneous assessment shall bear interest from the date the assessment was paid. No interest will be paid on sales taxes refunded to a dealer unless the dealer agrees to pass such interest on to the purchaser.\n\nB. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, if an individual overpays his individual income tax, the overpayment was for individual income taxes for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the overpayment has not been refunded, then interest shall accrue on the amount of the overpayment, beginning:\n\n(i) thirty days after payment of such tax if the individual filed his individual income tax return via electronic means; or\n\n(ii) sixty days after payment of such tax if the individual filed his individual income tax return using a method other than electronic means.\n\nIn no case shall interest be paid for the overpayment of the same tax pursuant to this subsection and subsection A.\n\n2. For the purposes of this subsection, interest shall accrue at a rate equal to the rate of interest established pursuant to § 58.1-15.

Any individual income tax deducted and withheld at the source and paid to the Department, and any amount paid as estimated tax, shall be deemed to have been paid on the day on which the return for such year's income was filed;\n\n2. Any corporate or estate and trust income tax deducted and withheld at the source and paid to the Department, and any amount paid as estimated tax, shall be deemed to have been paid on the day on which the return for such year's income was filed, or the last day prescribed by law for filing such return, whichever is later; and\n\n3. Any overpayment of tax resulting from the carry-back of a net operating loss or net capital loss shall be deemed to have been made on the day on which the return for the year in which the loss occurred was filed, or the last day prescribed by law for such filing, whichever is later.\n\nD. The Tax Commissioner and the State Comptroller shall implement procedures to allow an individual requesting a refund of the overpayment of individual income tax when filing his individual income tax return to elect on such return to have the refund paid by check mailed to the address provided on his return.

Any taxpayer required to file a return or to pay any tax administered or collected by the Department shall be eligible to participate in the Program, subject to the requirements in this section and guidelines established by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may require participants in the Program to complete an amnesty application and such other forms as he may prescribe and to furnish any additional information he deems necessary to make a determination regarding the validity of such amnesty application.\n\nC. The Tax Commissioner shall establish guidelines and rules for the procedures for participation and any other rules that are deemed necessary by the Tax Commissioner. The guidelines and rules issued by the Tax Commissioner regarding the Program shall be exempt from the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).\n\nD. The Program shall have the following features:\n\n1. The Program shall be conducted during the period July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, and shall not last less than 60 nor more than 75 days. The exact dates of the Program shall be established by the Tax Commissioner.\n\n2. All civil or criminal penalties assessed or assessable, as provided in this title, including the addition to tax under §§ 58.1-492 and 58.1-504, and one-half of the interest assessed or assessable, as provided in this title, which are the result of nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of tax liabilities, shall be waived upon receipt of the payment of the amount of taxes and interest owed, with the following exceptions:\n\na. No taxpayer currently under investigation or prosecution for filing a fraudulent return or failing to file a return with the intent to evade tax shall be eligible to participate in the Program.\n\nb. No taxpayer shall be eligible to participate in the Program with respect to any assessment outstanding for which the date of assessment is less than 90 days prior to the first day of the Program or with respect to any liability arising from the failure to file a return for which the due date of the return is less than 90 days prior to the first day of the Program.\n\nc. No taxpayer shall be eligible to participate in the Program with respect to any tax liability from the income taxes imposed by §§ 58.1-320, 58.1-360, and 58.1-400, if the tax liability is attributable to taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.\n\nE. For the purpose of computing the outstanding balance due because of the nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of any tax liability that has not been assessed prior to the first day of the Program, the rate of interest specified for omitted taxes and assessments under § 58.1-15 shall not be applicable. Instead, the Tax Commissioner shall establish one interest rate to be used for each taxable year that approximates the average \"underpayment rate\" specified under § 58.1-15 for the five-year period immediately preceding the Program.\n\nF. 1. If any taxpayer eligible for amnesty under this section and under the rules and guidelines established by the Tax Commissioner retains any outstanding balance after the close of the Program because of the nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of any tax liability eligible for relief under the Program, then such balance shall be subject to a 20 percent penalty on the unpaid tax. This penalty is in addition to all other penalties that may apply to the taxpayer.\n\n2. Any taxpayer who defaults upon any agreement to pay tax and interest arising out of a grant of amnesty is subject to reinstatement of the penalty and interest forgiven and the imposition of the penalty under this section as though the taxpayer retained the original outstanding balance at the close of the Program.\n\nG. For the purpose of implementing the Program, the Department is exempt from subsection B of § 2.2-2016.1 and §§ 2.2-2018.1, 2.2-2020, and 2.2-2021 pertaining to the Virginia Information Technologies Agency's project management and procurement oversight.\n\n2017, cc. 53, 433.",

The right to abatement of tax, interest, and penalties, in accordance with § 58.1-1835, attributable to any taxes administered by the Department, when the taxpayer reasonably relies upon binding written advice furnished to the taxpayer by the Department through authorized representatives in response to the taxpayer's specific written request which provided adequate and accurate information.\n\n5. The right to obtain simple, nontechnical statements which explain the procedures, remedies, and rights available during audit, appeals, and collection proceedings, including, but not limited to, the rights pursuant to this Taxpayer Bill of Rights and the right to be provided with an explanation for denials of refunds as well as the basis of the audit, assessments, and denials of refunds which identify any amount of tax, interest, or penalty due and which explain the consequences of the taxpayer's failure to comply with the notice, in accordance with § 58.1-1805.\n\n6. The right to be informed of impending collection actions which require sale or seizure of property or freezing of assets, except jeopardy assessments, and the right to at least fourteen days' notice in which to pay the liability or seek further review.\n\n7. After a jeopardy assessment, the right to have an immediate review of the jeopardy assessment, in accordance with § 58.1-313.\n\n8. The right to seek review, through formal or informal proceedings, of any adverse decisions relating to determinations in the audit or collections processes.\n\n9. The right to have the taxpayer's tax information kept confidential unless otherwise specified by law, in accordance with § 58.1-3.\n\n10. The right to procedures for retirement of tax obligations by installment payment agreements, in accordance with § 58.1-1817, which recognize both the taxpayer's financial condition and the best interests of the Commonwealth, provided that the taxpayer gives accurate, current information and meets all other tax obligations on schedule.\n\n11. The right to procedures, in accordance with § 58.1-1805, for requesting release of liens filed by the Department and for requesting that any lien which is filed in error be so noted on the lien cancellation filed by the Department and in a notice to any credit agency at the taxpayer's request, provided such request is made within three years of the release of the lien by the Department.\n\n12. The right to procedures which assure that the individual employees of the Department are not paid, evaluated, or promoted on the basis of the amount of assessments or collections from taxpayers, in accordance with subdivision 13 of § 58.1-202.\n\n13. The right to have the Department begin and complete its audits in a timely and expeditious manner after notification of intent to audit.\n\n1996, c. 634.",
