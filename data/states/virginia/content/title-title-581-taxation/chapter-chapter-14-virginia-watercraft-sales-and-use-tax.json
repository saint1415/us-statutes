The amount of the tax to be collected shall be determined by applying the following rate against the sale price, market value or gross receipts:\n\n1. Two percent of the sale price of each watercraft sold in the Commonwealth.\n\n2. Two percent of the sale price of each watercraft not sold in the Commonwealth but required to be titled in the Commonwealth. However, if the watercraft is first required to be titled in the Commonwealth six months or more after its acquisition, the tax shall be two percent of the market value of such watercraft at the time it is titled.\n\n3. Two percent of the gross receipts from the lease, charter or other use of any watercraft by a registered dealer.\n\nThe maximum tax levied under subdivisions 1 and 2 of this section shall be $2,000. A transaction taxed under subdivision 1 shall not be taxed under subdivision 2 or 3, nor shall the same transaction be taxed more than once under either subdivision 1, 2 or 3. Use of any watercraft by a registered dealer resulting in taxation under subdivision 3 shall not exempt any subsequent sale or use of such watercraft from being taxed under subdivision 1 or 2 if applicable.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 58-685.41, 58-685.44; 1981, c. 405; 1984, c. 675; 1987, c. 516; 1990, c. 666.",

In any case where (i) the invoice is not available, (ii) the Tax Commissioner has reason to believe that an invoice or return does not reflect the true sales price, or (iii) the watercraft was purchased more than six months prior to its use or storage in the Commonwealth, the Tax Commissioner may assess the tax in accordance with such publications or other data as are customarily employed in ascertaining the maximum sale price of watercraft. Where the Tax Commissioner finds that a charge for the rental, lease, charter or use of watercraft has been lower than the fair market value of such use, the Tax Commissioner may estimate a fair price in accordance with the cost of the watercraft, the cost of maintenance, the normal rental value as shown in similar transactions, or other relevant data.\n\nAny person who knowingly misrepresents the value of a watercraft or the amount of tax due to the Tax Commissioner or any return or invoice shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 58-685.44, 58-685.47; 1981, c. 405; 1984, c. 675.",
