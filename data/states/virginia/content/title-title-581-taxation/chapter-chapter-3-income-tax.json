Provided that the taxpayer has not itemized deductions for the taxable year on his federal income tax return: (i) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2019, and on and after January 1, 2027 $3,000 for single individuals and $6,000 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the case of a married individual filing a separate return); (ii) for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2019, but before January 1, 2022, $4,500 for single individuals and $9,000 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the case of a married individual filing a separate return); (iii) for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2022, but before January 1, 2024, $8,000 for single individuals and $16,000 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the case of a married individual filing a separate return); (iv) for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2025, $8,500 for single individuals and $17,000 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the case of a married individual filing a separate return); and (v) for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2025, but before January 1, 2027, $8,750 for single individuals and $17,500 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the case of a married individual filing a separate return).

If the payment is received in a single payment, then 10 percent of the recognized gain may be subtracted in the taxable year immediately following the year in which the single payment is received. The taxpayer may then deduct an equal amount in each of the nine succeeding taxable years.\n\n12. An amount equal to 20 percent of the sum paid by an individual pursuant to Chapter 6 (§ 58.1-600 et seq.), not to exceed $500 in each taxable year, in purchasing for his own use the following items of tangible personal property: (i) any clothes washers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, and standard size refrigerators that meet or exceed the applicable energy star efficiency requirements developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy; (ii) any fuel cell that (a) generates electricity using an electrochemical process, (b) has an electricity-only generation efficiency greater than 35 percent, and (c) has a generating capacity of at least two kilowatts; (iii) any gas heat pump that has a coefficient of performance of at least 1.25 for heating and at least 0.70 for cooling; (iv) any electric heat pump hot water heater that yields an energy factor of at least 1.7; (v) any electric heat pump that has a heating system performance factor of at least 8.0 and a cooling seasonal energy efficiency ratio of at least 13.0; (vi) any central air conditioner that has a cooling seasonal energy efficiency ratio of at least 13.5; (vii) any advanced gas or oil water heater that has an energy factor of at least 0.65; (viii) any advanced oil-fired boiler with a minimum annual fuel-utilization rating of 85; (ix) any advanced oil-fired furnace with a minimum annual fuel-utilization rating of 85; and (x) programmable thermostats.\n\n13.

The credit, however, shall be allowed only if the laws of such state: (i) grant a substantially similar credit to residents of Virginia subject to income tax under such laws or (ii) impose a tax upon the income of its residents derived from Virginia sources and exempt from taxation the income of residents of this Commonwealth.

If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other than from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax which results from adjustments determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change shall not be greater than if such adjustments were ratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the preceding taxable years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change is made. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations of the Department.\n\nE. In computing a taxpayer's Virginia taxable income for any taxable year under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's Virginia taxable income was computed, there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined, under regulations prescribed by the Department, to be necessary solely by reason of change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted.\n\nF. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this section, any accounting adjustments made for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year shall be applied in computing the taxpayer's taxable income for such year.\n\nCode 1950, § 58-151.061; 1971, Ex.

For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2021, but before January 1, 2022, a pass-through entity may make an election, in a format and according to such requirements and procedures to be established by the Department, to pay the tax levied by this section at the entity level for the taxable year. Such election shall be made on or before a date to be determined by the Department, which shall be set no earlier than one year after the extended due date for filing the applicable return. Notwithstanding §§ 58.1-1812 and 58.1-1833, no interest shall accrue on underpayments or overpayments solely attributable to such election.\n\n2. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2022, but before January 1, 2027, a pass-through entity may make an annual election, on its timely filed return pursuant to § 58.1-392, to pay the tax levied by this section at the entity level for the taxable period covered by such return. Such election shall be made on or before the due date for filing the applicable return, including any extensions that have been granted.\n\nB. A tax at the rate of 5.75 percent is hereby annually imposed on the Virginia taxable income, as calculated pursuant to § 58.1-391 but taking into account only the pro rata or distributive share of each item of income, gain, loss, or deduction attributable to eligible owners, for each taxable year of every pass-through entity that makes the election provided under subsection A.\n\nC. In computing the tax imposed by this section, the pro rata or distributive share of the Virginia taxable income of each nonresident eligible owner shall be limited to income that is attributable to Virginia sources and shall be subject to the modifications to income as described in §§ 58.1-322.01 through 58.1-322.04.\n\nD. A pass-through entity that elects to pay the tax levied by subsection B shall be eligible for all credits, deductions, or other adjustments to taxable income under § 58.1-391, provided that a pass-through entity's taxable income shall be adjusted to eliminate any federal deduction for state and local income taxes.\n\nE. Any person that is subject to the tax imposed under § 58.1-320 or 58.1-360 and is an eligible owner of a pass-through entity making the election pursuant to this section shall be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed, provided that taxable income has been adjusted to add back any deduction for state and local income taxes paid by the pass-through entity. Such credit shall be in an amount equal to such person's pro rata share of the tax paid under this section by any pass-through entity of which such person is an owner. If the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this subsection exceeds such person's tax liability for the tax imposed under § 58.1-320 or 58.1-360, as applicable, such excess shall be treated as an overpayment and refundable pursuant to § 58.1-499.\n\nF. If any pass-through entity makes an election pursuant to this section, the Department shall assess and collect tax, interest, and penalties as if such tax is a corporate income tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.).\n\nG. The Department shall develop and make publicly available guidelines implementing the provisions of this section and the credit authorized by subdivision C 2 of § 58.1-332.\n\n2022, cc. 690, 689; 2023, cc. 686, 687; 2025, c. 725.",

Every provider that owes the minimum tax imposed by this section shall remit such tax payment to the Department of Taxation.\n\nH. The minimum tax imposed by this section on providers is in lieu of all other state and local license fees or license taxes on providers and home service contracts.\n\nI. The minimum tax imposed by this section shall:\n\n1. Apply to (i) any entity that immediately prior to January 1, 2018, was licensed as a provider under former Article 2 (§ 38.2-2617 et seq.) of Chapter 26 of Title 38.2 and that continues to act as a provider on and after January 1, 2018, and (ii) any entity that registers to sell home service contracts under Chapter 33.1 (§ 59.1-434.1 et seq.) of Title 59.1 on or after January 1, 2018; and\n\n2. Not apply to any entity that was exempt from the provisions of former Article 2 (§ 38.2-2617 et seq.) of Chapter 26 of Title 38.2 immediately prior to January 1, 2018.\n\nJ. Notwithstanding § 58.1-3 or any other provision of law, the Department of Taxation and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services may exchange information regarding providers for purposes of enforcing the provisions of Chapter 33.1 (§ 59.1-434.1 et seq.) of Title 59.1.\n\n2017, c. 727.",

Accordingly, the provisions of subsections A and B relating to capital investment and new jobs are integral to the purpose of this section. If any provision of this section is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall not be deemed severable.\n\n2022, cc. 256, 257.",

For purposes of this section, the amount of any credit attributable to a partnership, electing small business corporation (S corporation), or limited liability company shall be allocated to the individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.\n\nC. A \"major business facility\" is a company that satisfies the following criteria:\n\n1. Subject to the provisions of subsections K or L, the establishment or expansion of the company shall result in the creation of at least 50 jobs for qualified full-time employees; the first such 50 jobs shall be referred to as the \"threshold amount\"; and\n\n2. The company is engaged in any business in the Commonwealth, except a retail trade business if such trade is the principal activity of an individual facility in the Commonwealth. Examples of types of major business facilities that are eligible for the credit provided under this section include, but are not limited to, a headquarters, or portion of such a facility, where company employees are physically employed, and where the majority of the company's financial, personnel, legal or planning functions are handled either on a regional or national basis. A company primarily engaged in the Commonwealth in the business of manufacturing or mining; agriculture, forestry or fishing; transportation or communications; or a public utility subject to the corporation income tax shall be deemed to have established or expanded a major business facility in the Commonwealth if it meets the requirements of subdivision 1 during a single taxable year and such facilities are not retail establishments. A major business facility shall also include facilities that perform central management or administrative activities, whether operated as a separate trade or business, or as a separate support operation of another business. Central management or administrative activities include, but are not limited to, general management; accounting; computing; tabulating; purchasing; transportation or shipping; engineering and systems planning; advertising; technical sales and support operations; central administrative offices and warehouses; research, development and testing laboratories; computer-programming, data-processing and other computer-related services facilities; and legal, financial, insurance, and real estate services. The terms used in this subdivision to refer to various types of businesses shall have the same meanings as those terms are commonly defined in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual.\n\nD. For purposes of this section, the \"credit year\" is the first taxable year following the taxable year in which the major business facility commenced or expanded operations.\n\nE. The Department of Taxation shall make all determinations as to the classification of a major business facility in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\nF. A \"qualified full-time employee\" means an employee filling a new, permanent full-time position in a major business facility in the Commonwealth. A \"new, permanent full-time position\" is a job of an indefinite duration, created by the company as a result of the establishment or expansion of a major business facility in the Commonwealth, requiring a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time a week for the entire normal year of the company's operations, which \"normal year\" shall consist of at least 48 weeks, or a position of indefinite duration which requires a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time a week for the portion of the taxable year in which the employee was initially hired for, or transferred to, the major business facility in the Commonwealth. Seasonal or temporary positions, or a job created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to the new major business facility and positions in building and grounds maintenance, security, and other such positions which are ancillary to the principal activities performed by the employees at a major business facility shall not qualify as new, permanent full-time positions.\n\nG. For any major business facility, the amount of credit earned pursuant to this section shall be equal to $1,000 per qualified full-time employee, over the threshold amount, employed during the credit year. The credit shall be allowed ratably, with one-third of the credit amount allowed annually for three years beginning with the credit year. However, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, one-half of the credit amount shall be allowed each year for two years. The portion of the $1,000 credit earned with respect to any qualified full-time employee who is employed in the Commonwealth for less than 12 full months during the credit year will be determined by multiplying the credit amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months that the qualified full-time employee worked for the major business facility in the Commonwealth during the credit year, and the denominator of which is 12. A separate credit year and a three-year allowance period shall exist for each distinct major business facility of a single taxpayer, except for credits allowed for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, when a two-year allowance period shall exist for each distinct major business facility of a single taxpayer.\n\nH. The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the tax imposed for such taxable year. Any credit not usable for the taxable year the credit was allowed may be, to the extent usable, carried over for the next 10 succeeding taxable years. No credit shall be carried back to a preceding taxable year. In the event that a taxpayer who is subject to the tax limitation imposed pursuant to this subsection is allowed another credit pursuant to any other section of the Code of Virginia, or has a credit carryover from a preceding taxable year, such taxpayer shall be considered to have first utilized any credit allowed which does not have a carryover provision, and then any credit which is carried forward from a preceding taxable year, prior to the utilization of any credit allowed pursuant to this section.\n\nI. No credit shall be earned pursuant to this section for any employee (i) for whom a credit under this section was previously earned by a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b) or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b); (ii) who was previously employed in the same job function in Virginia by a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b) or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b); (iii) whose job function was previously performed at a different location in Virginia by an employee of the taxpayer, a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b), or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b); or (iv) whose job function previously qualified for a credit under this section at a different major business facility on behalf of the taxpayer, a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b), or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b).\n\nJ. Subject to the provisions of subsections K or L, recapture of this credit, under the following circumstances, shall be accomplished by increasing the tax in any of the five years succeeding the taxable year in which a credit has been earned pursuant to this section if the number of qualified full-time employees decreases below the average number of qualified full-time employees employed during the credit year. Such tax increase amount shall be determined by (i) recomputing the credit which would have been earned for the original credit year using the decreased number of qualified full-time employees and (ii) subtracting such recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously earned. In the event that the average number of qualifying full-time employees employed at a major business facility falls below the threshold amount in any of the five taxable years succeeding the credit year, all credits earned with respect to such major business facility shall be recaptured. No credit amount will be recaptured more than once pursuant to this subsection. Any recapture pursuant to this section shall reduce credits earned but not yet allowed, and credits allowed but carried forward, before the taxpayer's tax liability may be increased.\n\nK. In the event that a major business facility is located in an economically distressed area or in an enterprise zone as defined in Chapter 49 (§ 59.1-538 et seq.) of Title 59.1 during a credit year, the threshold amount required to qualify for a credit pursuant to this section and to avoid full recapture shall be reduced from 50 to 25 for purposes of subdivision C 1 and subsection J. An area shall qualify as economically distressed if it is a city or county with an unemployment rate for the preceding year of at least 0.5 percent higher than the average statewide unemployment rate for such year. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall identify and publish a list of all economically distressed areas at least annually.\n\nL. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2004, but before January 1, 2006, in the event that a major business facility is located in a severely economically distressed area, the threshold amount required to qualify for a credit pursuant to this section and to avoid full recapture shall be reduced from 100 to 25 for purposes of subdivision C 1 and subsection J. However, the total amount of credit allowable under this subsection shall not exceed $100,000 in aggregate. An area shall qualify as severely economically distressed if it is a city or county with an unemployment rate for the preceding year of at least twice the average statewide unemployment rate for such year. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall identify and publish a list of all severely economically distressed areas at least annually.\n\nM. The Tax Commissioner shall promulgate regulations, in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), relating to (i) the computation, carryover, and recapture of the credit provided under this section; (ii) defining criteria for (a) a major business facility, (b) qualifying full-time employees at such facility, and (c) economically distressed areas; and (iii) the computation, carryover, recapture, and redemption of the credit by affiliated companies pursuant to subsection S.\n\nN. The provisions of this section shall apply only in instances where an announcement of intent to establish or expand a major business facility is made on or after January 1, 1994. An announcement of intent to establish or expand a major business facility includes, but is not limited to, a press conference or extensive press coverage, providing information with respect to the impact of the project on the economy of the area where the major business facility is to be established or expanded and the Commonwealth as a whole.\n\nO. The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall be granted to the person who pays taxes for the qualified full-time employees pursuant to Chapter 5 (§ 60.2-500 et seq.) of Title 60.2.\n\nP. No person shall claim a credit allowed pursuant to this section and the credit allowed pursuant to § 58.1-439.2. Any qualified business firm receiving an enterprise zone job creation grant under § 59.1-547 shall not be eligible to receive a major business facility job tax credit pursuant to this section for any job used to qualify for the enterprise zone job creation grant.\n\nQ. No person operating a business in the Commonwealth pursuant to Chapter 29 (§ 59.1-364 et seq.) of Title 59.1 shall claim a credit pursuant to this section.\n\nR. Notwithstanding subsection O, a taxpayer may, for the purpose of determining the number of qualified full-time employees at a major business facility, include the employees of a contractor or a subcontractor if such employees are permanently assigned to the taxpayer's major business facility. If the taxpayer includes the employees of a contractor or subcontractor in its total of qualified full-time employees, it shall enter into a contractual agreement with the contractor or subcontractor prohibiting the contractor or subcontractor from also claiming these employees in order to receive a credit given under this section. The taxpayer shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Department of Taxation that it has entered into such a contract.\n\nS. For purposes of satisfying the criteria of subdivision C 1, two or more affiliated companies may elect to aggregate the number of jobs created for qualified full-time employees as the result of the establishment or expansion by the individual companies in order to qualify for the credit allowed pursuant to this section. For purposes of this subsection, \"affiliated companies\" means two or more companies related to each other such that (i) one company owns at least 80 percent of the voting power of the other or others or (ii) at least 80 percent of the voting power of two or more companies is owned by the same interests.\n\nT. The General Assembly of Virginia finds that modern business infrastructure allows businesses to locate their administrative or manufacturing facilities with minimal regard to the location of markets or the transportation of raw materials and finished goods, and that the economic vitality of the Commonwealth would be enhanced if such facilities were established in Virginia. Accordingly, the provisions of this section targeting the credit to major business facilities and limiting the credit to those companies which establish a major business facility in Virginia are integral to the purpose of the credit earned pursuant to this section and shall not be deemed severable.\n\nU. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2019, and notwithstanding the provisions of § 58.1-3 or any other provision of law, the Department of Taxation, in consultation with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, shall publish the following information by November 1 of each year for the 12-month period ending on the preceding December 31:\n\n1. The location of sites used for major business facilities for which a credit was claimed;\n\n2. The North American Industry Classification System codes used for the major business facilities for which a credit was claimed;\n\n3. The number of qualified full time employees for whom a credit was claimed; and\n\n4. The total cost to the Commonwealth's general fund of the credits claimed.\n\nSuch information shall be published by the Department, regardless of how few taxpayers claimed the tax credit, in a manner that prevents the identification of particular taxpayers, reports, returns, or items.\n\n1994, cc. 750, 768; 1995, c. 365; 1996, c. 874; 1997, cc. 786, 852; 1998, c. 367; 2004, cc. 170, 619; 2005, cc. 863, 884; 2009, c. 753; 2010, cc. 363, 469; 2012, cc. 93, 445, 475; 2015, c. 451; 2019, c. 699; 2022, cc. 11, 203.",

For purposes of determining \"purchase price paid\" under this section, the taxpayer may use the original total capitalized cost of such machinery and equipment, less capitalized interest. For purposes of this section, \"advanced recycling\" means the operation of a single-stream or multi-stream recycling plant that converts waste materials into new materials for resale by processing them and breaking them down into their raw constituents. \"Advanced recycling\" includes the operation of a materials recovery facility or materials reclamation facility that receives, separates, and prepares recyclable materials for sale to end-user manufacturers.\n\n2.

The return must state the name of the production, provide a description of the production, and include a detailed accounting of the qualifying expenses with respect to which a credit is claimed.\n\n4. The Virginia Tourism Authority shall report to the Tax Commissioner on an annual basis the amount of tax credits that have been authorized for each fiscal year and the amount of tax credits that may be claimed for the current fiscal year by each taxpayer.\n\n5.

The taxpayer has the burden of proving eligibility for a credit and the amount of the credit. The Tax Commissioner shall consult with the Virginia Tourism Authority in order to determine the amount of qualifying expenses.\n\nF. For purposes of this section, the amount of any credit attributable to a partnership, electing small business corporation (S corporation), or limited liability company may be allocated to the individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.\n\nG. The total amount of credits allocated to all taxpayers under this section shall not exceed $2.5 million in the 2010-2012 biennium, $5 million in the 2012-2014 biennium, and $6.5 million in fiscal year 2015 and each fiscal year thereafter.\n\nH.

Location of sites used in a production for which a credit was claimed;\n\n2. Qualifying expenses for which a credit was claimed, classified by whether the expenses were for goods, services, or compensation paid by the production company;\n\n3. Number of people employed in the Commonwealth with respect to credits claimed; and\n\n4. Total cost to the Commonwealth's general fund of the credits claimed.\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of § 58.1-3 or any other law, such information shall be published by the Department, even if such information is not classified, so as to prevent the identification of particular taxpayers, reports, or returns and items.\n\nI. The Tax Commissioner shall develop guidelines implementing the provisions of this section, including but not limited to the definition of \"qualifying expenses\" and setting forth the recordkeeping requirements applicable to production companies claiming this credit. Such guidelines shall be exempt from the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).\n\n2010, cc. 419, 599; 2014, c. 730; 2017, cc. 108, 425; 2020, cc. 966, 967.",

Recapture of the credit amount, under the following circumstances, shall be accomplished by increasing the tax in any of the five years succeeding the taxable year in which a credit has been earned pursuant to this section if the number of qualified full-time employees falls below the average number of qualified full-time employees during the taxable year. The tax increase amount shall be determined by (i) recalculating the credit that would have been earned for the original taxable year using the decreased number of qualified full-time employees and (ii) subtracting the recalculated credit amount from the amount previously earned. In the event that the average number of qualified full-time employees employed at an international trade facility falls below the number employed by the taxpayer prior to claiming any credits pursuant to this section in any of the five taxable years succeeding the year in which the credits were earned, all credits earned with respect to the international trade facility shall be recaptured. No credit amount shall be recaptured more than once pursuant to this subsection.

For purposes of this section, the amount of any credit attributable to a partnership, electing small business corporation (S corporation), or limited liability company shall be allocated to the individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.\n\nD. The amount of tax credits available to any employer under this section in any taxable year shall not exceed the employer's tax liability. No unused tax credit shall be carried forward or carried back against the employer's tax liability. An employer shall be ineligible for a tax credit pursuant to this section if such employer claims a credit based on the jobs, wages, or other expenses for the same employee under any other provision of this chapter.\n\nE. An employer seeking to claim a tax credit provided herein shall submit a reservation application to the Tax Commissioner for tentative approval of the credit between September 1 and October 31 of the year preceding the calendar year in which the eligible telework expenses will be incurred. The Tax Commissioner shall establish policies and procedures for the reservation of tax credits by eligible employers. Such policies and procedures shall provide (i) requirements for applying for reservations of tax credits; (ii) a system for allocating the available amount of tax credits among eligible employers; and (iii) a procedure for the cancellation and reallocation of tax credit reservations allocated to eligible employers that, after reserving tax credits, have been determined to be ineligible for all or a portion of the tax credits reserved. Such application shall certify that the employer would not have incurred the eligible telework expenses for which the credit is sought but for the availability of such credit. The Tax Commissioner shall provide tentative approval of the applications no later than December 31 of the year in which the applications are received. When the application and amount of tax credits have been approved and the employer applicant notified, such employer may make purchases approved for the tax credits during the immediately following taxable year or lose the right to such credits.\n\nF. In no event shall the aggregate amount of tax credits approved by the Tax Commissioner exceed $1 million annually. In the event the credit amounts on the applications filed with the Tax Commissioner exceed the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits, then the tax credits shall be allocated on a pro rata basis based on the amounts allowed by subsection B among the eligible employers who filed timely applications.\n\nG.

Any taxpayer holding a credit under this section may transfer unused but otherwise allowable credit for use by another taxpayer on Virginia income tax returns. A taxpayer who transfers any amount of credit under this section shall file a notification of such transfer to the Department in accordance with procedures and forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. The transferred credits may be retroactively applied from the date such credits were originally issued, and the transferee may file an amended return under this chapter to claim such transferred credit for a prior tax year. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to extend the statute of limitations for filing an amended return under § 58.1-1823 or any other provision of law.\n\n2.

Scholarship foundations shall ensure that schools selected by students or eligible students with a disability to which tax-credit-derived funds may be paid (i) are in compliance with the Commonwealth's and locality's health and safety laws and codes; (ii) hold a valid occupancy permit as required by the locality; (iii) comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; and (iv) are (a) for students in grades K through 12, nonpublic schools that comply with nonpublic school accreditation requirements as set forth in § 22.1-19 and administered by the Virginia Council for Private Education or nonpublic schools that maintain an assessment system that annually measures the progress of scholarship students or eligible students with a disability in reading and math using a national norm-referenced achievement test, including but not limited to the Stanford Achievement Test, California Achievement Test, and Iowa Test of Basic Skills and (b) for eligible pre-kindergarten children, nonpublic pre-kindergarten programs.\n\n2. Each nonpublic pre-kindergarten program shall (i) provide to the eligible pre-kindergarten child a curriculum that is aligned with Virginia's Foundation Blocks for Early Learning: Comprehensive Standards for Four-Year-Olds as published by the Department of Education, or any successor standards published by the Department of Education; (ii) have maximum class sizes of 20 students with a teacher-student ratio of not fewer than two teachers for every 20 students; (iii) provide at least half-day services and operate for at least the school year; (iv) agree to provide the Department of Education with student information for each eligible pre-kindergarten child receiving a scholarship foundation scholarship for purposes of allowing the Department of Education to conduct studies comparing the academic performance of such children while attending primary or secondary school with other children attending primary or secondary school who have attended a pre-kindergarten program, including programs funded under the Virginia Preschool Initiative; and (v) require professional development of program teachers, which enables such teachers to engage in high-quality interactions with eligible pre-kindergarten children and provide high-quality instruction in accordance with the curriculum described under clause (i). Each nonpublic pre-kindergarten program teacher at a minimum shall have earned a certificate from a nationally recognized early childhood education certificate program, including but not limited to any early childhood education program provided or sponsored by the Virginia Community College System.\n\nIn awarding scholarships to eligible pre-kindergarten children, scholarship foundations shall award scholarships from tax-credit-derived funds only to such children who are enrolled in or attending nonpublic pre-kindergarten programs that meet the conditions of this subdivision as certified by the Virginia Council for Private Education or the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation.\n\n3. Eligible schools shall compile the results of any national norm-referenced achievement test for each of its students or eligible students with a disability receiving tax-credit-derived scholarships and shall provide the respective parents or legal guardians of such students or eligible students with a disability with a copy of the results on an annual basis, beginning with the first year of testing of the student or eligible student with a disability. Such schools also shall annually provide to the Department of Education for each such student or eligible student with a disability the achievement test results, beginning with the first year of testing of the student or eligible student with a disability, and information that would allow the Department to aggregate the achievement test results by grade level, gender, family income level, number of years of participation in the scholarship program, and race. Beginning with the third year of testing and test-related data collection, the Department of Education shall ensure that the achievement test results and associated learning gains are published on the Department of Education's website in accordance with such classifications and in an aggregate form as to prevent the identification of any student or eligible student with a disability. Eligible schools shall annually provide to the Superintendent of Public Instruction graduation rates of its students or eligible students with a disability participating in the scholarship program in a manner consistent with nationally recognized standards. In publishing and disseminating achievement test results and other information, the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Department of Education shall ensure compliance with all student privacy laws.\n\nThe provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to eligible pre-kindergarten children.\n\nE. 1. The aggregate amount of scholarships provided to each student or eligible student with a disability who does not meet the requirements of subdivision 2 for any single school year by all eligible scholarship foundations from eligible donations shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the actual qualified educational expenses of the student or (ii) 100 percent of the per-pupil amount distributed to the local school division (in which the student resides) as the state's share of the standards of quality costs using the composite index of ability to pay as defined in the general appropriation act.\n\n2. a. Except as provided in subdivision 1, the aggregate amount of scholarships provided to each eligible student with a disability for any single school year by all eligible scholarship foundations from eligible donations shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the actual qualified educational expenses of the student or (ii) 300 percent of the per pupil amount distributed to the local school division (in which the eligible student with a disability resides) as the state's share of the standards of quality costs using the composite index of ability to pay as defined in the general appropriation act.\n\nb. Except as provided in subdivision 1, scholarships may only be provided to an eligible student with a disability who is attending a school for students with disabilities, as defined in § 22.1-319, that (i) is licensed by the Department of Education to serve students with disabilities, (ii) complies with the nonpublic school accreditation requirements of the Virginia Association of Independent Schools, (iii) is exempt from taxation under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (iv) does not receive public funds to supplement the cost of the education of the eligible student with a disability that is receiving the scholarship pursuant to this section.\n\n3. In the case of eligible pre-kindergarten children, the aggregate amount of scholarships provided to each child for any single school year by all eligible scholarship foundations from eligible donations shall not exceed the lesser of the actual qualified educational expenses of the child or the state share of the grant per child under the Virginia Preschool Initiative for the locality in which the eligible pre-kindergarten child resides.\n\nF. Scholarship foundations shall develop procedures for disbursing scholarships in quarterly or semester payments throughout the school year to ensure scholarships are portable.\n\nG. Scholarship foundations that receive donations of marketable securities for which tax credits were issued under this article shall be required to sell such securities and convert the donation into cash immediately, but in no case more than 21 days after receipt of the donation.\n\nH. Each scholarship foundation with total revenues (including the value of all donations)(i) in excess of $100,000 for the foundation's most recent fiscal year ended shall have an audit or review performed by an independent certified public accountant of the foundation's donations received in such year for which tax credits were issued under this article or (ii) of $100,000 or less for the foundation's most recent fiscal year ended shall have a compilation performed by an independent certified public accountant of the foundation's donations received in such year for which tax credits were issued under this article. A summary report of the audit, review, or compilation shall be made available to the public and the Department of Education upon request.\n\nI. The Department of Education shall publish annually on its website a list of each scholarship foundation qualified under this article. Once a foundation has been qualified by the Department of Education, it shall remain qualified until the Department removes the foundation from its annual list. The Department of Education shall remove a foundation from the annual list if it no longer meets the requirements of this article. The Department of Education may periodically require a qualified foundation to submit updated or additional information for purposes of determining whether or not the foundation continues to meet the requirements of this article.\n\nJ. Actions of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department of Education relating to the awarding of tax credits under this article and the qualification of scholarship foundations shall be exempt from the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Decisions of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department of Education shall be final and not subject to review or appeal.\n\n2012, cc. 731, 842; 2013, cc. 713, 716; 2016, cc. 751, 767; 2019, cc. 808, 817.",

      "text": "A. Subject to the provisions of subsection H, a housing opportunity tax credit may be allowed for each qualified project for each year of the credit period, in an amount up to the amount of federal low-income housing tax credit allocated or allowed by the Authority to such qualified project. The credit shall be allowed ratably for each qualified project, with one-tenth of the total credit amount allowed annually for 10 years over the credit period, except that there shall be a reduction in the tax credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the calculation in 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) and any reduction by reason of 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) in the credit allowable for the first taxable year of the credit period shall be allowable for the first taxable year following the credit period.\n\nB. 1. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2021, but before January 1, 2031, a qualified taxpayer may claim a housing opportunity tax credit against its Virginia tax liability prior to reduction by any other credits allowed the taxpayer. The housing opportunity tax credit may be allocated by pass-through entities to some or all of its partners, members, or shareholders in any manner agreed to by such persons, regardless of whether or not any such person is allocated or allowed any portion of any federal low-income housing tax credit with respect to the qualified project, whether or not the allocation of the housing opportunity tax credit under the terms of the agreement has substantial economic effect within the meaning of § 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and whether any such person is deemed a partner for federal income tax purposes as long as the partner or member would be considered a partner or member as defined under applicable state law, and has been admitted as a partner or member on or prior to the date for filing the qualified taxpayer's tax return, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the year of the housing opportunity tax credit. Such pass-through entities or qualified taxpayer may assign all or any part of its interest, including its interest in the tax credits, to one or more pass-through entities or qualified taxpayers, and the qualified taxpayer shall be able to claim the housing opportunity tax credit so long as its interest is acquired prior to the filing of its tax return claiming the housing opportunity tax credit.\n\n2. If a housing opportunity tax credit has been awarded according to the terms of subsection G prior to January 1, 2031, such credit may continue to be claimed on a return for taxable years on and after January 1, 2031, but only pursuant to the applicable credit period specified in § 58.1-439.29.\n\nC. The housing opportunity tax credit authorized by this article shall not be refundable. Any housing opportunity tax credit not used in a taxable year may be carried forward by a qualified taxpayer for the succeeding five years.\n\nD. A qualified taxpayer claiming a housing opportunity tax credit shall submit a copy of the eligibility certificate at the time of filing its tax return with the Department. If the owner of the qualified project has applied to the Authority for the eligibility certificate but the Authority has not yet issued the eligibility certificate at the time the qualified taxpayer files its original tax return claiming the housing opportunity tax credit, the taxpayer may claim the housing opportunity tax credit based upon the amount of tax credit set forth in the award letter issued by the Authority for the housing opportunity tax credit issued to the qualified project and shall amend its tax return to include the eligibility certificate upon its receipt. If the amount of tax credit in the eligibility certificate is different than the amount of tax credit previously claimed, the taxpayer shall adjust the tax credit amount claimed on the amended tax return.\n\nE. If under § 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, a portion of any federal low-income housing credits taken on a qualified project is required to be recaptured or is otherwise disallowed during the credit period, the taxpayer claiming housing opportunity tax credits with respect to such project shall also be required to recapture a portion of any tax credits authorized by this article. The percentage of housing opportunity tax credits subject to recapture shall be equal to the percentage of federal low-income housing credits subject to recapture or otherwise disallowed during such period. Any tax credits recaptured or disallowed shall increase the income tax liability of the qualified taxpayer who claimed the tax credits in a like amount and shall be included on the tax return of the qualified taxpayer submitted for the taxable year in which the recapture or disallowance event is identified. The balance of any tax credits recaptured or disallowed shall be allocated by the Authority for any qualified project in accordance with subsection G.\n\nF. The Authority shall administer the housing opportunity tax credit program and shall be authorized to promulgate the regulations and guidelines necessary to implement and administer this article. Such regulations and guidelines may include the imposition of application, allocation, certification, and monitoring fees designed to recoup the costs of the Authority in administering the housing opportunity tax credit program.\n\nG. 1. Any housing opportunity tax credit amounts authorized in a calendar year that are subsequently (i) canceled and returned to the Authority or (ii) recaptured or disallowed pursuant to subsection E may be awarded in the following calendar year, but no later than December 31, 2030. If the amount of housing opportunity tax credits authorized in a calendar year for qualified projects is less than the total amount of credits available for qualified projects under subdivision H 2, the balance of such credits, in an amount not greater than 15 percent of the amount of credits available for qualified projects under subdivision H 2, (a) shall be allocated by the Authority for any qualified project in the following calendar year, (b) shall not be allocated at any time after such following calendar year, and (c) shall be allocated no later than December 31, 2030.\n\n2. Such housing opportunity tax credits issued pursuant to this subsection shall be allowed ratably, with one-tenth of the total amount of credits allowed annually for 10 years over the credit period, except that there shall be a reduction in the tax credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the calculation in 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) and any reduction by reason of 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) in the credit allowable for the first taxable year of the credit period shall be allowable for the first taxable year following the credit period.\n\nH. 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the aggregate amount of housing opportunity tax credits authorized for all qualified projects under this article shall not exceed $575 million across all calendar years.\n\n2. The total amount of housing opportunity tax credits authorized for qualified projects under this article shall not exceed $15 million for calendar year 2021.\n\n3. For calendar years 2022 through 2025, the total amount of housing opportunity tax credits authorized for qualified projects under this article shall not exceed $60 million per calendar year.\n\n4. For calendar years 2026 through 2030, the total amount of housing opportunity tax credits authorized for qualified projects under this article shall not exceed $64 million per calendar year.\n\n5. Such credits issued on and after January 1, 2022, shall be allowed ratably, with one-tenth of the total amount of credits allowed annually for 10 years over the credit period, except that there shall be a reduction in the tax credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the calculation in 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) and any reduction by reason of 26 U.S.C. § 42(f)(2) in the credit allowable for the first taxable year of the credit period shall be allowable for the first taxable year following the credit period.\n\nI. Notwithstanding any provision of law or regulation to the contrary, only Virginia housing opportunity tax credits awarded in calendar year 2021, up to a maximum of $15 million total for all taxpayers in all taxable years, may be claimed pursuant to the provisions of this section as set forth in Chapter 495 of the Acts of Assembly of 2021, Special Session I, prior to its amendment by the ninth enactment of Chapter 2 of the Acts of Assembly of 2022, Special Session I.\n\nJ. The Authority shall, upon request from the Chairs of the House Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations, provide information, data, and any other requested advisement on the potential structure and cost of a separately authorized certificated Virginia housing opportunity tax credit program that would allow a qualified project to sell all or any portion of its Virginia housing opportunity tax credits, to one or more unrelated taxpayers based on findings in the report of the Department of Housing and Community Development and the Authority stakeholder advisory group submitted pursuant to Chapter 517 of the Acts of Assembly of 2020.\n\nK. 1. Of the $60 million of Virginia housing opportunity tax credits authorized per calendar year from 2022 through 2025 for qualified projects by the Authority pursuant to this article, $20 million of such credits shall be first allocated exclusively for qualified projects located in a locality with a population no greater than 35,000 as determined by the most recent United States census.\n\n2. Of the $64 million of Virginia housing opportunity tax credits authorized per calendar year from 2026 through 2030 for qualified projects by the Authority pursuant to this article, $20 million of such credits shall be reserved for qualified projects located in a geographic area within the Balance of State Pool. The Authority shall notify the Virginia Housing Commission upon any change to the Balance of State Pool.\n\n3. Such allocation of Virginia housing opportunity tax credits shall constitute the minimum amount of such tax credits to be allocated for qualified projects in such localities. However, if the amount of such tax credits requested for qualified projects in such localities is less than the total amount of such credits available for qualified projects in such localities, the balance of such credits shall be allocated for any qualified project, regardless of location. In allocating or allowing such credits to qualified projects in such localities, the Authority may give equal consideration to qualified projects allocated or allowed a federal low-income housing credit in an amount equal to the 10-year present value calculation of the percentages prescribed under 26 U.S.C. §§ 42(b)(1)(B)(i) and 42(b)(1)(B)(ii).\n\n2021, Sp.

      "text": "A. For the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, a pass-through entity that has taxable income for the taxable year derived from or connected with Virginia sources, any portion of which is allocable to a nonresident owner, shall pay a withholding tax under this section, except as provided in subsection C.\n\nB. 1. The amount of withholding tax payable by any pass-through entity under this article shall be equal to five percent of the nonresident owner's share of income from Virginia sources of all nonresident owners as determined under this chapter, which may lawfully be taxed by the Commonwealth and which is allocable to a nonresident owner.\n\n2. When determining the amount of withholding tax due under this section, the pass-through entity may apply any tax credits allowable under the Code of Virginia to the pass-through entity that pass through to nonresident owners; provided that in no event may the application of any credit or credits reduce the tax liability of any nonresident owner under this article to less than zero.\n\nC. Withholding shall not be required:\n\n1. For any nonresident owner, other than a nonresident corporation, who is exempt from the tax imposed by this article. An owner shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this article only if the owner is, by reason of the owner's purpose or activities, exempt from paying federal income taxes on the owner's Virginia source income. The pass-through entity may rely on the written statement of the owner claiming to be exempt from the tax imposed by this article provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such owners in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392;\n\n2. For any nonresident owner that is a corporation that is exempt from the tax imposed by Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.). For purposes of this subdivision, a corporation is exempt from the tax imposed by Article 10 only if the corporation, by reason of its purpose or activities, is exempt from paying federal income taxes on the corporation's Virginia source income. The pass-through entity may rely on the written statement of the person claiming to be exempt from the tax imposed by Article 10 provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such corporations in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392;\n\n3. When compliance will cause undue hardship on the pass-through entity. However, no pass-through entity shall be exempt under this subdivision from complying with the withholding requirements of this section unless the Tax Commissioner, in his discretion, approves in writing the pass-through entity's written petition for exemption from the withholding requirements of this section based on undue hardship. The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the form and contents of such a petition and specify standards for when a pass-through entity will not be required to comply with the withholding requirements of this section due to undue hardship. The standards for undue hardship, determined by the Tax Commissioner in his discretion, shall take into account (among other relevant factors) the ability of a pass-through entity to comply at reasonable cost with the withholding requirements of this section and the cost to the Commonwealth of collecting the tax directly from a nonresident owner who does not voluntarily file a return and pay the amount of tax due under this chapter with respect to his allocable Virginia taxable income; or\n\n4. For any nonresident person of the Commonwealth when the pass-through entity owns and leases four or fewer dwelling units in the Commonwealth, provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such owners in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term \"person\" shall mean the same as that term is defined in § 55.1-1200.\n\nD. 1. Each pass-through entity required to withhold tax under this section shall pay the amount required to be withheld to the Tax Commissioner at the same time that the return under Article 9 (§ 58.1-390.1 et seq.), if required, is to be filed.\n\n2. An extension of time for filing the return under § 58.1-393.1 shall not extend the time for paying the amount of withholding tax due under this section. In cases of an extension of time for filing, the pass-through entity shall pay, by the due date specified in subsection A of § 58.1-392, at least 90 percent of the withholding tax due for the taxable year or 100 percent of the tax paid under this section for the prior taxable year, if that taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months and tax was paid under this section for that taxable year. The remaining portion of the tax due under this section, if any, shall be paid at the time the pass-through entity files the return required under § 58.1-392. If the balance due is paid by the last day of the extension period for filing such return and the amount of tax due with that return is 10 percent or less of the tax due under this section for the taxable year, no penalty shall be imposed with respect to the balance so remitted. In addition to interest, if the underestimation of the balance of tax due exceeds 10 percent of the actual tax liability, there shall be added to the tax as a penalty an amount equal to two percent per month of the balance of tax due for each month or fraction thereof from the original due date for the filing of the withholding tax return to the date of payment. If the amount of withholding tax due under this section for the taxable year is less than the estimated withholding taxes paid for the taxable year by the pass-through entity, the excess shall be refunded to the pass-through entity or, at its election, established as a credit against withholding tax due under this section for the then current taxable year.\n\n3. The Tax Commissioner may, if he believes it necessary for the protection of trust fund moneys due the Commonwealth, require any pass-through entity to pay over to the Tax Commissioner the tax deducted and withheld under this section at any earlier time or times.\n\nE. 1. Each nonresident owner shall be allowed a credit for that owner's share of the tax withheld by the pass-through entity under this section; provided, that when the distribution is to a corporation taxable under Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.), the credit allowed by this subsection shall be applied against the corporation's liability for tax under this chapter.\n\n2. A nonresident owner's share of any withholding tax paid by the pass-through entity shall be treated as distributed to such nonresident owner on the earlier of (i) the day on which such tax was paid to the Tax Commissioner by the pass-through entity or (ii) the last day of the taxable year for which such tax was paid by the pass-through entity.\n\nF. 1. Every pass-through entity required to deduct and withhold tax under this section shall furnish to each nonresident owner a written statement, as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, showing (i) the amount of its allocable Virginia taxable income, whether or not distributed for federal income tax purposes by such pass-through entity to such nonresident owner; (ii) the amount deducted and withheld as tax under this section; and (iii) such other information as the Tax Commissioner may require.\n\n2. A copy of the written statements required by this subsection shall be filed with the Virginia return filed under § 58.1-392 by the pass-through entity for its taxable year to which the distribution relates. The written statement shall be furnished to each nonresident owner on or before the due date of the pass-through entity's return under § 58.1-392 for the taxable year, including extensions of time for filing such return, or a later date as may be allowed by the Tax Commissioner.\n\nG. Every pass-through entity required to deduct and withhold tax under this section is hereby made liable for the payment of the tax due under this section for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. Any amount of tax withheld under this section shall be held in trust for the Tax Commissioner. No nonresident owner shall have a right of action against the pass-through entity in respect to any moneys withheld from such owner's distributive share and paid over to the Tax Commissioner in compliance with or in intended compliance with this section.\n\nH. If any pass-through entity fails to deduct and withhold tax as required by this section, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld under this section shall not be collected from the pass-through entity, but the pass-through entity shall not be relieved from liability for any penalties or interest or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to withhold.\n\n2007, c. 796; 2010, c. 120; 2011, c. 766.",

If a joint declaration is made but a joint return is not made for the taxable year, the estimated tax for such year may be treated as the estimated tax of either spouse, or may be divided between them.\n\nE.

In the case of any underpayment of estimated tax by an individual, trust or estate, except as provided in subsection C, there shall be added to the tax under this chapter for the taxable year an amount determined at the rate established for interest, under § 58.1-15, upon the amount of the underpayment (determined below), for the period of the underpayment (determined under subsection B). The amount of such addition to the tax shall be reported and paid at the time of filing the individual income tax return or the fiduciary income tax return for the taxable year.\n\nThe amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:\n\n1. The amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of an individual referred to in § 58.1-490 F, relating to income from farming) of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year, or if no return was filed, ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of individuals referred to in § 58.1-490 F, relating to income from farming) of the tax for such year; or 100 percent of the tax shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, whichever is less, over\n\n2. The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for such payment.\n\nB. The period of the underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to whichever of the following dates is the earlier:\n\n1. May 1, if a calendar year, or the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, if a fiscal year.\n\n2. With respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid. For purposes of this subdivision a payment of estimated tax on any installment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the extent such payment exceeds the amount of the installment determined under subdivision A 1 for such installment date.\n\nC. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B, the addition to the tax with respect to any underpayment of any installment shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds whichever of the following is the lesser:\n\n1. The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if estimated tax were whichever of the following is the least:\n\na. The tax shown on the return of the individual, trust or estate for the preceding taxable year, if a return showing a liability for tax was filed by the individual, trust or estate for the preceding taxable year and such preceding year was a taxable year of twelve months;\n\nb. An amount equal to the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the taxpayer's status with respect to personal exemptions for the taxable year, otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on his return for, and the law applicable to, the preceding year; or\n\nc. An amount equal to ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of individuals referred to in § 58.1-490 F, relating to income from farming) of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid. For purposes of this paragraph the taxable income shall be placed on an annualized basis by:\n\n(i) Multiplying by twelve (or, in the case of a taxable year of less than twelve months, the number of months in the taxable year) the taxable income (computed without deduction of personal exemptions) for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid, or, for a trust or estate, the months in the taxable year ending before the date that is one month before the month in which the installment is required to be paid;\n\n(ii) Dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the taxable year ending before the month in which such installment date falls, or, for a trust or estate, the months in the taxable year ending before the date that is one month before the month in which the installment is required to be paid; and\n\n(iii) Deducting from such amount the deductions for personal exemptions allowable for the taxable year (such personal exemptions being determined as of the last date prescribed for payment of the installment); or\n\n2. An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the actual taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.\n\nD. For purposes of applying this section:\n\n1. The estimated tax shall be computed without any reduction for the amount which the individual estimates as his credit under § 58.1-480 (relating to tax withheld at source on wages);\n\n2. The amount of the credit allowed under § 58.1-480 for the taxable year shall be deemed a payment of estimated tax, and an equal part of such amount shall be deemed paid on each installment date (determined under § 58.1-491) for such taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amounts so withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which such amounts were actually withheld; and\n\n3. There shall be no addition to tax imposed for underpayment of estimated tax of $1,000 or less for the taxable year.\n\nE.

The overpayment shall be refunded out of the state treasury on the order of the Tax Commissioner upon the Comptroller.\n\nB. If a refund of an overpayment of individual income tax payments is made payable jointly to married individuals who receive a final divorce decree after filing a joint income tax return, separate income tax returns on a single form, an amendment thereto, or other claim resulting in the issuance of a refund, the Tax Commissioner shall order the reissuance of the refund in separate checks to each spouse if the unnegotiated joint refund check is returned to Department with a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Department, made by one spouse that the other spouse refuses to endorse the joint refund check or cannot be located. In making such certification, the spouse returning the check shall agree to indemnify the Commonwealth for any amounts that the Commonwealth may be required to pay to the other spouse with respect to such refund. A certified copy of the final divorce decree, including any agreement with respect to the division of property between the spouses, shall be provided with the certification.

The reissuance of refund payments pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the joint and several liability of the spouses for tax liabilities for the period for which the return or returns were filed.\n\nC.

For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax liability imposed by §§ 58.1-320 and 58.1-400, an amount equal to 50 percent of the fair market value of any land or interest in land located in Virginia that is conveyed for the purpose of agricultural and forestal use, open space, natural resource, and/or biodiversity conservation, or land, agricultural, watershed and/or historic preservation, as an unconditional donation by the landowner/taxpayer to a public or private conservation agency eligible to hold such land and interests therein for conservation or preservation purposes. For such conveyances made on or after January 1, 2007, the tax credit shall be 40 percent of the fair market value of the land or interest in land so conveyed.\n\n2. a. If the Commonwealth or an instrumentality thereof operates a facility on a conveyance, including charging fees for the use of such facility, such operation shall not disqualify the conveyance from eligibility for the tax credit, so long as any fees are used for conservation or preservation purposes.\n\nb. If the Commonwealth or an instrumentality thereof enters into an agreement with a third party to lease or manage a facility on a conveyance, the fact that such third party is operated primarily as a business with intent for profit shall not disqualify the conveyance from eligibility for the tax credit, so long as such agreement is for conservation or preservation purposes.\n\nB. The fair market value of qualified donations made under this section shall be determined in accordance with § 58.1-512.1 and substantiated by a \"qualified appraisal\" prepared by a \"qualified appraiser,\" as those terms are defined under applicable federal law and regulations governing charitable contributions. The value of the donated interest in land that qualifies for credit under this section, as determined according to appropriate federal law and regulations, shall be subject to the limits established by United States Internal Revenue Code § 170(e). In order to qualify for a tax credit under this section, the qualified appraisal shall be signed by the qualified appraiser, who must be licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia as provided in § 54.1-2011, and a copy of the appraisal shall be submitted to the Department. In the event that any appraiser falsely or fraudulently overstates the value of the contributed property in an appraisal that the appraiser has signed, the Department may disallow further appraisals signed by the appraiser and shall refer the appraiser to the Real Estate Appraiser Board for appropriate disciplinary action pursuant to § 54.1-2013, which may include, but need not be limited to, revocation of the appraiser's license. Any appraisal that, upon audit by the Department, is determined to be false or fraudulent, may be disregarded by the Department in determining the fair market value of the property and the amount of tax credit to be allowed under this section.\n\nC. 1. The amount of the credit that may be claimed by each taxpayer, including credit claimed by applying unused credits as provided under subsection C of § 58.1-513, shall not exceed $50,000 for 2000 taxable years; $75,000 for 2001 taxable years; $100,000 for each of 2002 through 2008 taxable years; $50,000 for each of 2009, 2010, and 2011 taxable years; $100,000 for each of 2012, 2013, and 2014 taxable years; $20,000 for each of 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxable years; and $50,000 for 2018 taxable years and for each taxable year thereafter. However, for any fee simple donation of land conveyed to the Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2015, the amount of the credit claimed shall not exceed $100,000 for each taxable year, provided that no part of the charitable contributions deduction under § 170 of the Internal Revenue Code related to such fee simple donation is allowable by reason of a sale or exchange of property. In addition, for each taxpayer, in any one taxable year the credit used may not exceed the amount of individual, fiduciary or corporate income tax otherwise due. Any portion of the credit that is unused in any one taxable year may be carried over for a maximum of 10 consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the credit originated until fully expended. A credit shall not be reduced by the amount of unused credit that could have been claimed in a prior year by the taxpayer but was unclaimed. For taxpayers affected by the credit reduction for taxable years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2015 and thereafter, any portion of the credit that is unused in any one taxable year may be carried over for a maximum of 13 consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the credit originated until fully expended.\n\n2. Qualified donations shall include the conveyance of a fee interest in real property or the conveyance in perpetuity of a less-than-fee interest in real property, such as a conservation restriction, preservation restriction, agricultural preservation restriction, or watershed preservation restriction, provided that such less-than-fee interest qualifies as a charitable deduction under § 170(h) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\nThe Department of Conservation and Recreation shall compile an annual report on qualified donations of less-than-fee interests accepted by any public or private conservation agency in the respective calendar year and shall submit the report by December 1 of each year to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations. In preparing such report, the Department of Conservation and Recreation shall consult and coordinate with the Department of Taxation and the Departments of Forestry and Agriculture and Consumer Services to provide an estimate of the number of acres of land currently being used for \"production agriculture and silviculture\" as defined in § 3.2-300 that have been protected by qualified donations of less-than-fee interests. This report shall include information, when available, on land qualifying for credits being used for \"production agriculture and silviculture\" that have onsite operational best management practices, which are designed to reduce the amount of nutrients and sediment entering public waters. In addition, the report shall include information, when available, on riparian buffers, both vegetated/forested buffers and no-plow buffers, required by deed restriction on land qualifying for credits in order to protect water quality. This information shall be reported in summary fashion as appropriate to preserve confidentiality of information. Qualified donations shall not include the conveyance of a fee interest, or a less-than-fee interest, in real property by a charitable organization that (i) meets the definition of \"holder\" in § 10.1-1009 and (ii) holds one or more conservation easements acquired pursuant to the authority conferred on a \"holder\" by § 10.1-1010.\n\n3. Any fee interest, or a less-than-fee interest, in real property that has been dedicated as open space within, or as part of, a residential subdivision or any other type of residential or commercial development; dedicated as open space in, or as part of, any real estate development plan; or dedicated for the purpose of fulfilling density requirements to obtain approvals for zoning, subdivision, site plan, or building permits shall not be a qualified donation under this article.\n\n4. Qualified donations shall be eligible for the tax credit herein described if such donations are made to the Commonwealth of Virginia, an instrumentality thereof, or a charitable organization described in § 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if such charitable organization (i) meets the requirements of § 509(a)(2) or (ii) meets the requirements of § 509(a)(3) and is controlled by an organization described in § 509(a)(2).\n\n5. The preservation, agricultural preservation, historic preservation or similar use and purpose of such property shall be assured in perpetuity. In the case of conveyances of a fee interest to a charitable organization that is a \"holder\" as defined in § 10.1-1009, the credit shall not be allowed until the charitable organization agrees that subsequent conveyances of the fee interest in the property will be (i) subject to a previous conveyance in perpetuity of a conservation easement, as that term is defined in § 10.1-1009, or subject to the conveyance in perpetuity of an open-space easement, as that term is defined in § 10.1-1700, or (ii) conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia or to a federal conservation agency. No credit shall be allowed with respect to any subsequent conveyances by the charitable organization.\n\nD. The issuance of tax credits under this article for donations made on and after January 1, 2007, shall be in accordance with procedures and deadlines established by the Department and shall be administered under the following conditions:\n\n1. The taxpayer shall apply for a credit after completing the donation by submitting a form or forms prescribed by the Department in consultation with the Department of Conservation and Recreation. If the application requests a credit of $1 million or more or if the donation meets the conditions of subdivision 3 c, then a copy of the application shall also be filed with the Department of Conservation and Recreation by the taxpayer. The application shall include, but not be limited to:\n\na. A description of the conservation purpose or purposes being served by the donation;\n\nb. The fair market value of land being donated in the absence of any easement or other restriction;\n\nc. The public benefit derived from the donation;\n\nd. The extent to which water quality best management practices will be implemented on the property; and\n\ne. Whether the property is fully or partially forested and a forest management plan is included in the terms of the donation.\n\n2. Applications for otherwise qualified donations of a less-than-fee interest shall be accompanied by an affidavit describing how the donated interest in land meets the requirements of § 170(h) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations adopted thereunder. The application with accompanying affidavit shall be submitted to the Department of Taxation, with a copy also provided to the Department of Conservation and Recreation.\n\n3. a. No credit in the amount of $1 million or more shall be issued with respect to a donation unless the conservation value of the donation has been verified by the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, based on the criteria adopted by the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation for this purpose. Such criteria and subsequent amendments shall be exempt from the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), but the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation shall provide for adequate public participation, including adequate notice and opportunity to provide comments on the proposed criteria. The Director shall act on applications within 90 days of his receipt of a complete application and shall notify the taxpayer and the Department of Taxation of his action.\n\nb. For purposes of determining whether a credit requires verification of the conservation value, the credits allowed under this article with respect to donations of any other portion of a recorded parcel of land within the preceding 11 years shall be aggregated with the credit claimed for the current donation. This subdivision shall not apply if (i) all owners of the parcel who have been allowed credit for a qualified donation are not affiliated with the person or entity seeking credit for the current donation of a different portion of the parcel and (ii) in the case of an individual seeking credit, the individual has not previously made a qualified donation for any portion of the parcel and is not an immediate family member of any such owners.\n\nc. If (i) the real property that is the subject of the donation was partitioned from or part of another parcel of land and any other portion of such parcel, or any land partitioned from such parcel of land, has been allowed a tax credit under this article (or an application for tax credit is pending) within three years of such donation and (ii) the tax credit that would otherwise be allowed to the donor for such donation is at least $250,000, then no credit under this article shall be issued with respect to such donation described in clause (i) unless the conservation value of the donation has been verified by the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation. The Director shall act on applications within 90 days of his receipt of a complete application and shall notify the taxpayer and the Department of Taxation of his action. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed or interpreted (a) as allowing additional tax credit for any land or interest in land previously conveyed for which tax credit has already been allowed under this article or (b) affecting the validity of any tax credit allowed under this article for a prior conveyance of any land or interest in land.\n\n4. a. Tax credits shall be issued on a calendar year basis, and in no case shall the Department issue more than the maximum allowed for the calendar year. The maximum amount of credits that may be issued in a calendar year shall be $100 million plus any credits previously issued under this article but subsequently disallowed or invalidated by the Department. Credits previously issued but subsequently disallowed or invalidated shall be reissued in a subsequent calendar year. All credits shall be issued in the order that each complete application is filed. For filings by mail or a recognized commercial delivery service, the postmark or confirmation of shipment shall determine the date of filing. If within 30 days after an application for credits has been filed the Tax Commissioner provides written notice to the donor that he has determined that the preparation of a second qualified appraisal is warranted, the application shall not be deemed complete until the fair market value of the donation has been finally determined by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall make a final determination within 180 days of notifying the donor, unless the donor has filed an appeal. The donor shall have the right to appeal any decision of the Department in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18 (§ 58.1-1800 et seq.). If more than one complete application is filed at the same time, the credits with respect to those applications shall be issued in the order that the conveyances were recorded in the appropriate circuit court of the Commonwealth. In the event that a credit requires verification of the conservation value by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and such verification has not been received at the time the maximum $100 million allowed is reached for the calendar year of the donation, such credit shall not be issued for that calendar year but shall be issued in the calendar year that the conservation value of the credit is verified by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.\n\nNo credit shall be allowed for any land or interest in land conveyed unless (i) for a conveyance made before January 1, 2020, a complete application for tax credit with regard to the conveyance has been filed with the Department by December 31 of the third year following the calendar year of the conveyance or (ii) for a conveyance made on or after January 1, 2020, a complete application for tax credit with regard to the conveyance has been filed with the Department by December 31 of the second year following the calendar year of the conveyance. For filings by mail or a recognized commercial delivery service, the postmark or confirmation of shipment shall determine the date of filing. Solely for purposes of this condition, any application for which the Tax Commissioner has given written notice to the donor that the preparation of a second qualified appraisal is warranted shall be deemed timely filed, provided that the application was otherwise complete as of such filing deadline. For conveyances made on and after January 1, 2017, the deadlines provided by clauses (i) and (ii) of this subdivision shall be extended for any number of days exceeding 90 during which an application for tax credit is being reviewed for verification of conservation value by the Department of Conservation and Recreation, if the application was otherwise complete at the time of the original filing deadline.\n\nb. Beginning with calendar year 2008, the $100 million amount contained in subdivision 4 a shall be increased by an amount equal to $100 million multiplied by the percentage by which the consumer price index for all-urban consumers published by the United States Department of Labor (CPI-U) for the 12-month period ending August 31 of the preceding year exceeds the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending August 31, 2006.\n\nc. Beginning with calendar year 2015, the maximum amount of credits that may be issued in a calendar year shall not exceed $75 million. In no case shall the Department issue any tax credit for a donation from any allocation or pool of tax credits attributable to a calendar year prior to the year in which the complete tax credit application for the donation was filed.\n\nBeginning with the submission due on or before December 20, 2015, and in each year thereafter, the Governor shall include in \"The Budget Bill\" submitted pursuant to subsection A of § 2.2-1509 or in his amendments to the general appropriation act in effect submitted pursuant to subsection E of § 2.2-1509 a recommended appropriation from the general fund equal to the difference between the amount calculated pursuant to subdivision b and $75 million, but not more than $20 million, to be allocated as follows: 80 percent to the Virginia Land Conservation Fund to be used in accordance with § 10.1-1020, with no less than 50 percent of such appropriation to be used for fee simple acquisitions with public access or acquisitions of easements with public access; 10 percent to the Virginia Battlefield Preservation Fund to be used in accordance with § 10.1-2202.4; and 10 percent to the Virginia Farmland and Forestland Preservation Fund to be used in accordance with § 10.1-1119.3.\n\n5. a. Any taxpayer that has been issued a tax credit by the Department shall be allowed to use such credit for his or its taxable year that begins in the calendar year for which such credit was issued and for succeeding taxable years in accordance with the 10 consecutive taxable year carryforward provisions of this article, except for any taxpayer affected by the credit limitation for taxable years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2015 and taxable years thereafter. Such a taxpayer shall be allowed to use such credit for his or its taxable year that begins in the calendar year for which such credit was issued and for succeeding taxable years in accordance with the 13 consecutive taxable year carryforward provisions of this article.\n\nb. Any taxpayer to whom a credit has been transferred may use such credit for the taxable year in which the transfer occurred and unused amounts may be carried forward to succeeding taxable years, but in no event may such transferred credit be used more than 11 years after it was originally issued by the Department or in any taxable year of such taxpayer that ended prior to the date of transfer, except for any taxpayer affected by the credit limitation for taxable years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2015 and taxable years thereafter. Such a taxpayer may use such credit for the taxable year in which the transfer occurred and unused amounts may be carried forward to succeeding taxable years, but in no event may such transferred credit be used more than 14 years after it was originally issued by the Department or in any taxable year of such taxpayer that ended prior to the date of transfer.\n\n6. Neither the verification of conservation value by the Department of Conservation and Recreation nor the issuance of a credit by the Department of Taxation shall in any way be construed or interpreted as prohibiting the Department of Taxation or the Tax Commissioner from auditing any credit claimed pursuant to the provisions of this article or from assessing tax relating to the claiming of any credit under this article.\n\nE. In any review or appeal before the Tax Commissioner or in any court in the Commonwealth the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to show that the fair market value and conservation value at the time of the qualified donation is consistent with this section and that all requirements of this article have been satisfied.\n\n1999, cc. 968, 983; 2005, c. 940; 2006, Sp.

The Department shall update the guidelines as necessary as determined by the Tax Commissioner. Such guidelines shall be exempt from the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) but the Department shall provide for adequate public participation, including adequate notice and opportunity to provide comments on the proposed guidelines.\n\nB. For purposes of any appraisal for a conveyance under the provisions of this article, the value for any structures or other improvements to land shall be determined in accordance with law. For any otherwise qualified donation of a less-than-fee interest under this article, however, no more than 25% of the total credit allowed shall be for reductions in value to any structures and other improvements to land.\n\nC.

Any building which serves as the basis, in whole or in part, of a tax credit under this article shall not serve as the basis of the tax credit allowed under § 58.1-339.2 for a period of five years following the donation on which the credit is based; and any building which serves as the basis for the tax credit allowed under § 58.1-339.2 shall not serve as the basis, in whole or in part, for a tax credit under this article for a period of five years following the completion of the rehabilitation project on which the credit is based.\n\nB. Any tax credits that arise under this article from the donation of land or an interest in land made by a pass-through tax entity such as a trust, estate, partnership, limited liability company or partnership, limited partnership, subchapter S corporation or other fiduciary shall be used either by such entity if it is the taxpayer on behalf of such entity or by the member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary, as the case may be, in proportion to their interest in such entity in the event that income, deductions and tax liability pass through such entity to such member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary or as set forth in the agreement of said entity. Such tax credits shall not be claimed by both the entity and the member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary for the same donation.\n\nC. 1. Any taxpayer holding a credit under this article may transfer unused but otherwise allowable credit for use by another taxpayer on Virginia income tax returns. A taxpayer who transfers any amount of credit under this article shall file a notification of such transfer to the Department in accordance with procedures and forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.\n\n2. A fee of two percent of the value of the donated interest shall be imposed upon any transfer arising from the sale by any taxpayer of credits under this article and upon the distribution of a portion of credits under this article to a member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary pursuant to subsection B. The two percent fee shall not apply to a distribution of credits to a nonresident owner of a pass-through entity when such credits are applied by the pass-through entity to the withholding tax pursuant to subdivision B 2 of § 58.1-486.2. Revenues generated by such fees first shall be used by the Department of Taxation and the Department of Conservation and Recreation for their costs in implementing this article but in no event shall such amount exceed 50 percent of the total revenue generated by the fee on an annual basis. The remainder of such revenues shall be transferred to the Virginia Land Conservation Fund for distribution to the public or private conservation agencies or organizations, excluding federal governmental entities, that are responsible for enforcing the conservation and preservation purposes of the donated interests. Distribution of such revenues shall be made annually by the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation proportionally based on a three-year average of the number of donated interests accepted by the public or private conservation agencies or organizations, excluding federal governmental entities, during the immediately preceding three-year period.\n\n3. If the individual taxpayer who originally earned the tax credit holds unused credit under this article, he may provide through a will, bequest, or other instrument of transfer that, upon his death, his unused credit shall be transferred to a designated beneficiary. If such taxpayer dies without a will, his unused credit shall be transferred to the next person who is eligible to receive according to the rules of intestate succession as described in § 64.2-200; however, if two or more persons are eligible to receive according to such rules, the administrator of the taxpayer's estate shall choose one such person to whom to transfer such taxpayer's unused credit. The two percent fee described in subdivision 2 shall not apply to a transfer of unused credits pursuant to this subdivision. The carryover period for such transferred credits shall not be extended; instead, such credits shall be subject to the original carryover period as determined pursuant to subdivision C 1 of § 58.1-512.\n\nD.

The transfer of the credit and its application against a tax liability shall not create gain or loss for the transferor or the transferee of such credit.\n\nF. A pass-through tax entity, such as a partnership, limited liability company or Subchapter S corporation, may appoint a tax matters representative, who shall be a general partner, member/manager or shareholder, and register that representative with the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall be entitled to deal with the tax matters representative as representative of the taxpayers to whom credits have been allocated or transferred by the entity under this article with respect to those credits. In the event a pass-through tax entity allocates or transfers tax credits arising under this article to its partners, members or shareholders and the allocated or transferred credits shall be disallowed, in whole or in part, such that an assessment of additional tax against a taxpayer shall be made, the Tax Commissioner shall first make written demand for payment of any additional tax, together with interest and penalties, from the tax matters representative.
