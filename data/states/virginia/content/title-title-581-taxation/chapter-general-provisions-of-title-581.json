      "text": "As used in this title:\n\n\"Department\" means the Department of Taxation. Whenever the words \"Department of Taxation,\" or other words denoting that Department, appear in any provision of law or in any legal or other proceeding or in any other manner, the same shall be construed to mean the Tax Commissioner. When any provision of law imposes a duty upon, or vests power in, the Department, such duty shall be performed and such power shall be exercised by the Tax Commissioner.\n\n\"Resident\" for purposes of taxation, except as to Chapter 3 (§ 58.1-300 et seq.) of this title or as otherwise specifically provided, includes every person domiciled in the Commonwealth on the first day of any tax year, and every other person who has had his place of abode in the Commonwealth for the longer portion of the twelve months next preceding January 1 in each year, unless on or before that day he has changed his place of abode to a place outside the Commonwealth with the bona fide intention of continuing actually to abide permanently outside the Commonwealth.\n\nThe fact that a person who has so changed his place of abode, within six months from so doing, again abides within the Commonwealth shall be prima facie evidence that he did not intend permanently to have his actual place of abode outside the Commonwealth. Such person so changing his actual place of abode and not intending permanently to continue it outside the Commonwealth and not having listed his property for taxation as a resident of the Commonwealth for the purpose of having his personal property listed for taxation in the Commonwealth, shall be deemed to have resided on the day when such property should have been listed, at his last place of abode in the Commonwealth. The fact that a person whose place of abode during the greater portion of such twelve months has been in the Commonwealth does not claim or exercise the right to vote at public elections in the Commonwealth shall not, of itself, constitute him a nonresident of the Commonwealth within the meaning of this term.\n\n\"Tax Commissioner\" means the chief executive officer of the Department of Taxation or his delegate.\n\n\"Tax day\" or \"date of assessment,\" except as otherwise specifically provided, is January 1 of each year.\n\n\"Tax exempt organization\" or \"an organization exempt from taxation under § 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code\" means any corporation, partnership, organization or trust which has received written notice of its exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, if such notice is required by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain exempt status.\n\n\"Tax year,\" except when otherwise specifically provided, begins on January 1 of each year and ends on December 31 of each year.\n\n\"Taxes\" and \"levies\" as used in this title are synonymous. The terms \"taxes\" and \"levies,\" however, shall not include the assessments for local improvements provided for in Article 2 (§ 15.2-2404 et seq.) of Chapter 24 of Title 15.2 or the charter of any city or town.\n\n\"Taxpayer\" includes every person, corporation, partnership, organization, trust or estate subject to taxation under the laws of this Commonwealth, or under the ordinances, resolutions or orders of any county, city, town or other political subdivision of this Commonwealth.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 58-1 through 58-4, 58-5 through 58-8; 1964, c. 468; 1972, c. 88; 1984, c. 675; 1997, c. 694.",

All agreements entered into by the Governor with respect to any method of collection as to which provision is expressly made by statute shall conform to the provisions of such statute. As to any other method of collection appropriate to the powers vested in the Governor by this section, the Governor may agree to such terms and conditions as in his judgment are best calculated to promote the interests of this Commonwealth.

Except in accordance with a proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, the Tax Commissioner or agent, clerk, commissioner of the revenue, treasurer, or any other state or local tax or revenue officer or employee, or any person to whom tax information is divulged pursuant to this section or § 58.1-512, 58.1-2712.2, or 58.1-3826, or any former officer or employee of any of the aforementioned offices shall not divulge any information acquired by him in the performance of his duties with respect to the transactions, property, including personal property, income or business of any person, firm or corporation.

The Attorney General shall provide the list within 15 days of receipt of the request. If the manufacturer wishes to obtain actual copies of the reports the Stamping Agents filed with the Attorney General, it must first request them from the Stamping Agents pursuant to subsection C of § 3.2-4209. If the manufacturer does not receive the reports pursuant to subsection C of § 3.2-4209, the manufacturer may make a written request to the Attorney General, including a copy of the prior written request to the Stamping Agent and any response received, for copies of any reports not received. The Attorney General shall provide copies of the reports within 45 days of receipt of the request.\n\nB. 1.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other law, the Department, upon request by the General Assembly or any duly constituted committee of the General Assembly, shall disclose the total aggregate amount of an income tax deduction or credit taken by all taxpayers, regardless of (i) how few taxpayers took the deduction or credit or (ii) any other circumstances. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a local tax official from disclosing whether a person, firm or corporation is licensed to do business in that locality and divulging, upon written request, the name and address of any person, firm or corporation transacting business under a fictitious name. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner of revenue is authorized to provide, upon written request stating the reason for such request, the Tax Commissioner with information obtained from local tax returns and other information pertaining to the income, sales and property of any person, firm or corporation licensed to do business in that locality.\n\n2.

However, if through no fault of the taxpayer (i) no such postmark is affixed or (ii) the postmark affixed by the United States Postal Service is illegible or bears no date, such remittance of a tax return or a tax payment shall be deemed to have been timely if received through the United States mail no later than five days following the time of the close of business on the last day on which such return may be filed or such tax may be paid without penalty or interest. Additionally, no penalty or interest shall be imposed if a taxpayer provides evidence that remittance of a tax return or a tax payment was timely by producing a United States Postal Service Certificate of Mailing, or other proof of mailing, showing such return was filed or such payment was made before the close of business on the last day such return may be filed or such tax may be paid without penalty or interest.\n\nB.

If an individual tax return shall be accompanied by attachments or schedules that cannot be accepted through electronic means, the income tax preparer shall file the return using software that produces a two dimensional barcode using 2D technology reflecting information contained in the return in a standard format as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. This subsection shall not apply to an individual income tax return for a taxpayer who has indicated that he does not want his individual income tax return filed using electronic means or 2D technology.\n\nThe Tax Commissioner shall have the authority to waive the requirement to file by electronic means upon finding that the requirement would cause an undue hardship. The income tax return preparer otherwise required to file individual income tax returns using electronic means shall request in writing the waiver from the Tax Commissioner and clearly demonstrate the nature of the undue hardship. The Tax Commissioner shall respond to the income tax return preparer within 45 days after receiving the request for waiver.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, \"income tax return preparer\" means a person who prepares, or employs one or more individuals to prepare, an income tax return for compensation. Preparation of a substantial portion of an individual income tax return shall be deemed preparation of the entire individual income tax return for purposes of this section.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, \"income tax return preparer\" does not include volunteers who prepare tax returns for the elderly or poor as part of a nonprofit organization's program.\n\nCode 1950, § 58-4.2; 1966, c. 690; 1984, c. 675; 1996, cc. 370, 449, 635, 657; 2000, c. 995; 2004, c. 562; 2008, c. 217; 2010, cc. 36, 151, 635; 2011, c. 368; 2023, c. 163.",
