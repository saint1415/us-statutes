Except as provided in subsection C, every motor carrier shall pay a road tax per gallon equivalent to the cents per gallon credit for diesel fuel as determined under subsection A of § 58.1-2706 for the relevant period plus an additional amount per gallon, as determined by subsection B, calculated on the amount of motor fuel, diesel fuel or liquefied gases (which would not exist as liquids at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute), used in its operations within the Commonwealth.\n\nThe tax imposed by this chapter shall be in addition to all other taxes of whatever character imposed on a motor carrier by any other provision of law.\n\nB. The additional amount per gallon shall be determined by the Commissioner annually, effective July 1 of each year. On July 1, 2019, the additional amount per gallon shall be calculated by multiplying the average fuel economy by $0.01125. On July 1, 2020, and each July 1 thereafter, the additional amount per gallon shall be calculated by multiplying the average fuel economy by $0.0225. The additional amount per gallon shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent. For purposes of this subsection, \"average fuel economy\" shall be calculated by dividing the total taxable miles driven in the Commonwealth by the total taxable gallons of fuel consumed in the Commonwealth, as reported in IFTA returns in the preceding taxable year.\n\nC. In lieu of the tax imposed in subsection A, motor carriers registering qualified highway vehicles that are not registered under the International Registration Plan shall pay a fee of $150 per year for each qualified highway vehicle regardless of whether such vehicle will be included on the motor carrier's IFTA return. For the period of July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, the fee shall be adjusted based on the percent change in the road tax imposed pursuant to subsection A from June 30, 2019, to July 1, 2019. The Commissioner shall adjust the fee annually on July 1 of every year thereafter based on the percentage change in the road tax imposed pursuant to subsection A for the previous fiscal year as compared to the current fiscal year. The fee is due and payable when the vehicle registration fees are paid pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 (§ 46.2-685 et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 46.2.\n\nIf a vehicle becomes a qualified highway vehicle before the end of its registration period, the fee due at the time the vehicle becomes a qualified highway vehicle shall be prorated monthly to the registration expiration month. Fees paid under this subsection shall not be refunded unless a full refund of the registration fee paid is authorized by law.\n\nD.
