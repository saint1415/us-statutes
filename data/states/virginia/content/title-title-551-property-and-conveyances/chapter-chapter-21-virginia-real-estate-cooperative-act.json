      "text": "As used in this chapter or in the declaration and bylaws, unless provided otherwise or unless the context requires a different meaning:\n\n\"Affiliate of a declarant\" means any person that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a declarant. A person \"controls\" a declarant if the person (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the declarant; (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than 20 percent of the voting interest in the declarant; (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the declarant; or (iv) has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the declarant. A person \"is controlled by\" a declarant if the declarant (a) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the person; (b) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than 20 percent of the voting interest in the person; (c) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the person; or (d) has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the person. Control does not exist if the powers described in this definition are held solely as security for an obligation and are not exercised.\n\n\"Allocated interests\" means the common expense liability and the ownership interest and votes in the association allocated to each cooperative interest.\n\n\"Association\" or \"proprietary lessees' association\" means the proprietary lessees' association organized under § 55.1-2132.\n\n\"Capital components\" means those items, whether or not a part of the common elements, for which the association has the obligation for repair, replacement, or restoration and for which the executive board determines funding is necessary.\n\n\"Common elements\" means all portions of a cooperative other than the units of such cooperative.\n\n\"Common expenses\" means any expenditures made by, or financial liabilities of, the association, together with any allocations to reserves.\n\n\"Common expense liability\" means liability for common expenses allocated to each cooperative interest pursuant to § 55.1-2118.\n\n\"Conversion building\" means a building that at any time before creation of the cooperative was occupied wholly or partially by persons other than purchasers and persons who occupy with the consent of purchasers.\n\n\"Cooperative\" means real estate owned by an association, each of the members of which is entitled, by virtue of his ownership interest in the association, to exclusive possession of a unit.\n\n\"Cooperative interest\" means an ownership interest in the association coupled with a possessory interest in a unit under a proprietary lease.

An advertisement in a newspaper or other periodical of general circulation, or in any broadcast medium to the general public, of a cooperative not located in the Commonwealth is not an offering if the advertisement states that an offering may be made only in compliance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the cooperative is located.\n\n\"Person\" means a natural person, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity. In the case of a land trust, however, \"person\" means the beneficiary of the trust rather than the trust or the trustee.\n\n\"Proprietary lease\" means an agreement with the association pursuant to which a proprietary lessee has a possessory interest in a unit.\n\n\"Proprietary lessee\" means a person that owns a cooperative interest, other than as security for an obligation, and the declarant with respect to cooperative interests or potential cooperative interests to which allocated interests have been allocated pursuant to § 55.1-2118 until that cooperative interest has been created and conveyed to another person.\n\n\"Purchaser\" means any person, other than a declarant or a person in the business of selling cooperative interests for his own account, that, by means of a voluntary transfer, acquires or contracts to acquire a cooperative interest other than as security for an obligation.\n\n\"Real estate\" means any leasehold or other estate or interest in, over, or under land, including structures, fixtures, and other improvements and interests that, by custom, usage, or law, pass with a conveyance of land though not described in the contract of sale or instrument of conveyance. \"Real estate\" includes (i) parcels with or without upper or lower boundaries and (ii) spaces that may be filled with air or water.\n\n\"Residential purposes\" means use for dwelling or recreational purposes, or both.\n\n\"Security interest\" means an interest in real or personal property, created by contract or conveyance, that secures payment or performance of an obligation. \"Security interest\" includes a mortgage, deed of trust, trust deed, security deed, contract for deed, land sales contract, lease intended as security, assignment of lease or rents intended as security, pledge of an ownership interest in an association, and any other consensual lien or title retention contract intended as security for an obligation.\n\n\"Special declarant rights\" means rights reserved for the benefit of a declarant to (i) complete improvements described in the public offering statement pursuant to subdivision A 2 of § 55.1-2155; (ii) exercise any development right pursuant to § 55.1-2120; (iii) maintain sales offices, management offices, signs advertising the cooperative, and models; (iv) use easements through the common elements for the purpose of making improvements within the cooperative or within real estate that may be added to the cooperative; (v) make the cooperative part of a larger cooperative or group of cooperatives; (vi) make the cooperative subject to a master association as specified in § 55.1-2130; or (vii) appoint or remove any officer of the association, any master association, or any executive board member during any period of declarant control.\n\n\"Time share\" means a right to occupy a unit or any of several units during five or more separated time periods over a period of at least five years, including renewal options, whether or not coupled with an estate or interest in a cooperative or a specified portion of such estate or interest.\n\n\"Unit\" means a physical portion of the cooperative designated for separate occupancy under a proprietary lease.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-426; 2005, c. 436; 2019, c. 712.",

Unless the declaration provides that the entire chapter is applicable, such a cooperative is subject only to §§ 55.1-2104 and 55.1-2105 if the cooperative contains only units restricted to nonresidential use or contains no more than three units and is not subject to any development rights.\n\nB. Except as provided in subsection C, §§ 55.1-2100, 55.1-2104, 55.1-2105, 55.1-2109, 55.1-2114, and 55.1-2131, subdivisions A 1 through 6 and 11 through 17 of § 55.1-2133, and §§ 55.1-2143, 55.1-2148, 55.1-2151, 55.1-2169, 55.1-2170, and 55.1-2309 apply to all cooperatives created in the Commonwealth before July 1, 1982. Those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after July 1, 1982, and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. With regard to any cooperative created before July 1, 1982, § 55.1-2104 applies only to real estate acquired by that cooperative's association on or after that date. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative was created before July 1, 1982, if the cooperative was conveyed to the association before that date.\n\nC. If a cooperative created within the Commonwealth before July 1, 1982, contains no more than three units and is not subject to any development rights, it is subject only to §§ 55.1-2104 and 55.1-2105, unless the declaration is amended to make any or all of the sections enumerated in subsection B apply to that cooperative.\n\nD. This chapter does not apply to cooperatives or cooperative interests located outside the Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions as given in §§ 55.1-2153 through 55.1-2160 apply to all contracts for the disposition of cooperative interests signed in the Commonwealth by any party, unless exempt under subsection B of § 55.1-2153. The Common Interest Community Board regulations provisions under Article 5 (§ 55.1-2173 et seq.) apply to any such offering in the Commonwealth.\n\nE. This chapter does not apply to any cooperatives that receive federal funding pursuant to the public housing or § 8 program under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended.\n\nF. This chapter does not apply to any cooperative that, when acquired by an association, is subject to a mortgage or deed of trust securing an indebtedness owed to any government or governmental authority to which the association has contractual obligations in addition to those set forth in such mortgage or deed of trust.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-425; 1983, c. 312; 1986, cc. 368, 557; 2019, c. 712; 2023, cc. 387, 388.",

Unless waived by a proprietary lessee, a cooperative interest is subject to the provisions of Title 34 (§ 34-1 et seq.), regarding the homestead exemption.\n\nB. Any portion of the common elements for which the declarant has reserved any development right shall be separately taxed and assessed against the declarant, and the declarant alone is liable for the payment of those taxes.\n\nC. When the highest and best use of any parcel improved by a multi-unit cooperative apartment complex is achieved by sale of the cooperative apartment units as individual units, the fair market value of the parcel shall be determined by aggregating the fair market value of all taxable real estate that is part of the parcel, including each cooperative apartment unit and common elements. The fair market value of each such cooperative apartment unit shall be established by determining its fair market value for sale as an individual unit, determined in the same manner, mutatis mutandis, as the fair market value of condominium units. Tax bills shall be issued for each individual cooperative apartment unit.\n\nNo assessment of any parcel improved by a multi-unit cooperative apartment complex, whether the assessment was made before or after the adoption of this subsection, shall be held to be invalid because of the use of the method described in this subsection to determine the assessment.\n\nD. Any duly authorized real estate assessor, board of assessors, or department of real estate assessments may require that all declarants, associations, master associations, and proprietary lessees' associations in the county or city subject to local taxation furnish to such assessor, board, or department on or before a time specified a statement listing all transfers of the cooperative apartment units over a specified period of time and a statement listing all owners and proprietary lessees of the cooperative apartment units as of a specified date. Each such statement shall be certified as to its accuracy by the declarant, association, master association, or proprietary lessees' association for which the statement is furnished or by a duly authorized agent of such declarant or association. Any statement required by this subsection shall be kept confidential in accordance with the provisions of § 58.1-3.\n\nE. Subsections C and D apply to all cooperatives created in the Commonwealth, whether created before, on, or after July 1, 1982. However, subsections C and D do not apply to any multi-unit cooperative apartment complex the cooperative apartment units of which have been continually in use as such since December 31, 1967.\n\nF. Any residential cooperative association the members of which are owners of cooperative interests in a cooperative under this chapter shall not be deemed to be a business for any state and local purposes, including liability for payment of sales, meals, hotel, motel, or gross receipts taxes and business licenses, to the extent that such residential cooperative association collects payments from residents of such cooperative.\n\nG. Any tangible personal property owned by a residential cooperative association that would be considered household goods and personal effects if owned and used by an individual or by a family or household incident to maintaining an abode shall be considered household goods and personal effects owned and used by an individual or by a family or household incident to maintaining an abode for the purposes of § 58.1-3504 and any local ordinance authorized pursuant to § 58.1-3504.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-428; 1988, c. 412; 2002, c. 34; 2003, c. 351; 2019, c. 712.",

Subdivision and site plan ordinances in any locality shall apply to any cooperative in the same manner as such ordinances would apply to a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership. Nevertheless, the declarant need not apply for or obtain subdivision approval to record cooperative instruments against a portion of the land that may be submitted to the cooperative if the site plan approval for the land being submitted to the cooperative has first been obtained.\n\nC. During development of a cooperative containing additional land or withdrawable land, phase lines created by the cooperative instruments shall not be considered property lines for purposes of subdivision. If the cooperative may no longer be expanded by the addition of additional land, the owner of the land not part of the cooperative shall subdivide such land prior to its conveyance, unless such land is subject to an approved site plan as provided in subsection B, or prior to modification of such approved site plan. In the event of any conveyance of land within phase lines of the cooperative, the cooperative and any lot created by such conveyance shall be deemed to comply with the local subdivision ordinance, provided that such land is subject to an approved site plan.\n\nD. Localities may provide by ordinance that proposed cooperatives comprising conversion buildings and the use of such conversion buildings that do not conform to the zoning, land use, and site plan regulations of the respective county or city in which the property is located shall secure a special use permit, a special exception, or variance, as applicable, prior to such property's becoming a cooperative. The local authority shall grant a request for such a special use permit, special exception, or variance filed on or after July 1, 1982, if the applicant can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the local authority that the nonconformities are not likely to be adversely affected by the proposed conversion. The local authority shall not unreasonably delay action on any such request. In the event of an approved conversion, a locality, sanitary district, or other political subdivision may impose such charges and fees as are lawfully imposed by such locality, sanitary district, or other political subdivision as a result of construction of new structures to the extent that such charges and fees, or portions of such charges and fees, imposed upon property subject to such conversions may be reasonably related to greater or additional services provided by the locality, sanitary district, or political subdivision as a result of the conversion.\n\nE. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit application of any provision of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.), or any local ordinances regulating the design and construction of roads, sewer and water lines, stormwater management facilities, or other public infrastructure, that is not expressly applicable to cooperatives by reason of their form of ownership to a cooperative in a manner different from the manner in which such provision is applied to other buildings of similar physical form and nature of occupancy.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-429; 2004, c. 242; 2019, c. 712.",

Upon acquisition, unless the order otherwise provides, that cooperative interest's allocated interests are automatically reallocated to the remaining cooperative interests in proportion to the respective allocated interests of those cooperative interests before the taking, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection is thereafter a common element.\n\nB. Except as provided in subsection A, if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award for such unit shall compensate the proprietary lessee for the reduction in value of his cooperative interest. Unless the order provides otherwise, upon acquisition (i) that cooperative interest's allocated interests are reduced in proportion to the reduction in the size of the unit, or on any other basis specified in the declaration, and (ii) the portion of the allocated interests divested from the cooperative interest of which the partially acquired unit is a part is automatically reallocated to that cooperative interest and the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated interests of those cooperative interests before the taking, with the cooperative interest of which the partially acquired unit is a part participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated interests.\n\nC. If part of the common elements is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the common elements taken shall be paid to the association. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common element shall be equally divided among the proprietary lessees of the units to which that limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition.\n\nD.

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the cooperative are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.\n\nB. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratification of such agreement in the same manner as a deed by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all such ratifications must be recorded in every county or city in which a portion of the cooperative is situated and is effective only upon recordation.\n\nC. The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract for the sale of real estate in the cooperative, but the contract is not binding until approved pursuant to subsections A and B. After such approval, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded, and the proceeds of such sale are distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Except to the extent that any provisions in the declaration limit the amount that may be received by a proprietary lessee upon termination, as set forth in subdivision A 12 of § 55.1-2116, proceeds of the sale must be distributed to holders of liens against the association and against the cooperative interests and to proprietary lessees, all as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections D and E. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of such occupancy, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on proprietary lessees by this chapter or the declaration.\n\nD. Following termination of the cooperative, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for proprietary lessees and holders of liens against the association and the cooperative interests, as their interests may appear. The declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of proprietary lessees and creditors of proprietary lessees. Where the declaration provides such a priority, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative that were recorded or docketed before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and all other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have such priority:\n\n1. The lien of each creditor of the association that was perfected against the association before termination becomes a lien against each cooperative interest upon termination as of the date the lien was perfected;\n\n2. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens against the cooperative interests immediately before termination;\n\n3. The amounts of the liens of the association's creditors described in subdivisions 1 and 2 against each of the cooperative interests must be proportionate to the ratio that that cooperative interest's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all the cooperative interests;\n\n4. The lien of each creditor of each proprietary lessee that was perfected before termination continues as a lien against that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected; and\n\n5. The assets of the association shall be distributed to all proprietary lessees and all lienholders against their cooperative interests as their interests may appear in the order described in subdivisions 1 through 4, and creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any proprietary lessee in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest.\n\nE. The respective interests of proprietary lessees referred to in subsections C and D are as follows:\n\n1. Except as provided in subdivision 2, the respective interests of proprietary lessees are the fair market values of their cooperative interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. Appraisers selected shall hold a designation awarded by a major, nationwide testing or certifying professional appraisal society or association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the proprietary lessees and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which 25 percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any proprietary lessee's interest to that of all proprietary lessees is determined by dividing the fair market value of that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest by the total fair market values of all the cooperative interests.\n\n2. If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value of the unit or limited common element before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all proprietary lessees are their respective ownership interests in the association immediately before the termination.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-454; 1983, c. 96; 2019, c. 712.",

A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration.\n\n2. A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in subdivision 3 or 4, who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration:\n\na.

A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs pursuant to § 55.1-2125, if he is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a current public offering statement, any liability arising as a result of providing a public offering statement, and obligations under Article 5 (§ 55.1-2173 et seq.).\n\n4. A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed or other instrument of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title to cooperative interests or real estate subject to development rights under subsection C may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. After declaring such an intention in a recorded instrument, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any cooperative interest or real estate subject to development rights owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of subsection D of § 55.1-2134 for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability for his acts and omissions under subsection D of § 55.1-2134.\n\nF.

The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies; and\n\n2. Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and units.\n\nB. If the insurance described in subsection A is not reasonably available, the association shall notify all proprietary lessees by hand delivery or by United States mail, sent prepaid. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the proprietary lessees.\n\nC. Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection A must provide that:\n\n1. Each proprietary lessee is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association;\n\n2. The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any proprietary lessee or member of his household;\n\n3. No act or omission by any proprietary lessee, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and\n\n4. If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a proprietary lessee covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.\n\nD. Any loss covered by the property policy under subdivision A 1 must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, proprietary lessees, and lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection G, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property. The association, proprietary lessees, and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored, or the cooperative is terminated.\n\nE. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a proprietary lessee from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.\n\nF. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any proprietary lessee or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each proprietary lessee, and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known address.\n\nG. Any portion of the cooperative for which insurance is required under this section that is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless (i) the cooperative is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80 percent of the proprietary lessees, including every proprietary lessee of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire cooperative is not repaired or replaced, (a) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the cooperative and (b) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees, the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not rebuilt must be distributed to the proprietary lessees of those units and the proprietary lessees of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lien holders, as their interests may appear, and the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the proprietary lessees or lien holders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the cooperative interests. If the proprietary lessees vote not to rebuild any unit, the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under subsection A of § 55.1-2105, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, § 55.1-2128 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the cooperative is terminated.\n\nH.

Any common expense or portion benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed exclusively against the cooperative interests for the units benefited; and\n\n3.

Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged pursuant to subdivisions A 11 and 12 of § 55.1-2133 are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment becomes due. Upon nonpayment of the assessment, the proprietary lessee may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section. The association's lien may be foreclosed (i) by judicial sale in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or (ii) by power of sale as provided in subsection I.\n\nB. A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a cooperative interest except (i) liens and encumbrances on the cooperative that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (ii) any first security interest encumbering only the cooperative interest of a proprietary lessee and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the cooperative or the cooperative interest. The lien is also prior to the security interests described in clause (ii) to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-2133 that would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. The lien under this section is not subject to homestead or other exemptions.\n\nC. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority.\n\nD. Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation or filing of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.\n\nE. A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within 120 months after the full amount of the assessment becomes due.\n\nF. This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection A creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a transfer in lieu of foreclosure.\n\nG. A judgment in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party.\n\nH. Upon written request, the association shall furnish to a proprietary lessee a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against his cooperative interest. The statement shall be in recordable form. The statement shall be furnished within 10 business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board, and every proprietary lessee.\n\nI. The association may conduct a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the cooperative interest against which the association has perfected one or more liens pursuant to this section if the total sums secured are in excess of $5,000, exclusive of attorney fees and costs. Sale may be at a public sale or by private negotiation and at any time and place, but every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place, and terms, must be reasonable. The association shall give to the proprietary lessee and any sublessees of the proprietary lessee reasonable written notice of the time and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private disposition may be made. The same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a recorded interest in the cooperative interest that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required by this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. Sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.\n\nJ. The proceeds of a sale under subsection I shall be applied in the following order:\n\n1. The reasonable expenses of sale;\n\n2. The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; holding, maintaining, and preparing the cooperative interest for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges, premiums on hazard and liability insurance, and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the proprietary lessee, reasonable attorney fees and other legal expenses incurred by the association;\n\n3. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any prior claims of record;\n\n4. Satisfaction of the association's lien;\n\n5. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and\n\n6. Remittance of any excess to the proprietary lessee. Unless otherwise agreed, the proprietary lessee is liable for any deficiency.\n\nK. If a cooperative interest is sold under subsection I, a good faith purchaser for value acquires the proprietary lessee's interest in the cooperative interest free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with the requirements of this section. The person conducting the sale under subsection I shall execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the cooperative interest that states that the conveyance is executed by him, after a foreclosure by power of sale of the association's lien and that he has power to make the sale.

A declarant of a cooperative containing conversion buildings shall give each of the tenants of a conversion building formal notice of the conversion at the time the cooperative is registered by the Common Interest Community Board. This notice shall advise each tenant of (i) the offering price of the cooperative interests for the unit he occupies; (ii) the projected common expense assessments against that cooperative interest for at least the first year of the cooperative's operation; (iii) any relocation services, public or private, of which the declarant is aware; (iv) any measure taken or to be taken by the declarant to reduce the incidence of tenant dislocation; and (v) the details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant, to assist tenants in relocating. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than 120 days' notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Until the expiration of the 120-day period, the declarant shall have no right of access to the unit except as provided in this section and in subsection A of § 55.1-1229 except that, upon 45 days' written notice to the tenant, the declarant may enter the unit in order to make additional repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements, provided that (a) the making of the same does not constitute an actual or constructive eviction of the tenant and (b) such entry is made either with the consent of the tenant or only at times when the tenant is absent from the unit. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession. The declarant shall also provide general notice to the tenants of the cooperative or proposed cooperative at the time of application to the Common Interest Community Board, in addition to the formal notice required by this subsection.\n\nC. For 60 days after delivery or mailing of the formal notice described in subsection B, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases the unit associated with that cooperative interest. A specific statement of the purchase price and the amount of any initial or special cooperative fee due from the purchaser on or before settlement of the purchase contract and the basis of such fee shall be given to the tenant. If a tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that 60-day period, the offeror shall not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following 180 days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit that is part of that cooperative interest will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.\n\nD. If a seller, in violation of subsection C, conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection C to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection C but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection C.\n\nE. If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, and otherwise complies with the provisions of §§ 55.1-1202 and 55.1-1225, the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate as specified by §§ 55.1-1410, 55.1-1202, and 55.1-1225. The details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant for assisting tenants in relocating, shall also be provided to the tenant.\n\nF. Any locality may require by ordinance that the declarant of a conversion cooperative file with that governing body all information required by the Common Interest Community Board pursuant to § 55.1-2176 and a copy of the formal notice required by subsection B. Such information shall be filed with that governing body when the application for registration is filed with the Common Interest Community Board, and such copy of the formal notice shall be filed with that governing body whenever it is sent to tenants. No fee shall be imposed for such filings with a governing body.\n\nG. The governing body of any county utilizing the urban county executive form of optional government (§§ 15.2-800 through 15.2-858) or the county manager plan of optional government (§§ 15.2-702 through 15.2-749), or of any city or town adjoining any such county, may require by ordinance that the declarant of any residential cooperative containing conversion buildings converted from multi-family rental use shall reimburse any tenant displaced by the conversion for amounts actually expended to relocate as a result of such dislocation. The reimbursement shall not be required to exceed the amount that the tenant would have been entitled to receive under §§ 25.1-407 and 25.1-415 if the real estate comprising the condominium had been condemned by the Department of Highways and Transportation.\n\nH. Any locality may require by ordinance that elderly or disabled tenants, occupying as their residence up to 20 percent of the apartments or units in a cooperative containing conversion buildings at the time of issuance of the general notice required by subsection B, be offered leases or extensions of leases on the apartments or units they occupy or on other apartments or units of at least equal size and overall quality for up to three years beyond the date of such notice.\n\nThe terms and conditions of such leases or extensions of leases shall be as agreed upon by the lessor and the lessee, provided that the rent for such apartment or unit shall not be in excess of reasonable rent for comparable apartments or units in the same market area as such conversion building.\n\nSuch leases or extensions shall not be required, however, in the case of any apartments or units that will, in the course of the conversion, be substantially altered in physical layout, restricted exclusively to nonresidential use, or be converted in such a manner as to require relocation of the tenant in premises outside of the project being converted.\n\nI. Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-487; 1983, c. 310; 1984, c. 321; 1985, c. 69; 1993, c. 634; 2008, cc. 851, 871; 2019, c. 712.",

The Common Interest Community Board may initiate public or private investigations within or outside the Commonwealth to determine whether any representation in any document or information filed with the Common Interest Community Board is false or misleading or whether any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any unlawful act or practice.\n\nB. In the course of any investigation or hearing, the Common Interest Community Board may subpoena witnesses and documents, administer oaths and affirmations, and adduce evidence. If a person fails to comply with a subpoena or to answer questions propounded during the investigation or hearing, the Common Interest Community Board may apply to the appropriate court for a contempt order or for injunctive or other appropriate relief to secure compliance.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-503; 2019, c. 712.",

A declarant shall file promptly amendments to the public offering statement with the Common Interest Community Board.\n\nC. If an annual report reveals that a declarant owns or controls cooperative interests representing less than 25 percent of the voting power in the association and that a declarant has no power to increase the number of units in the cooperative or to cause a merger or confederation of the cooperative with other cooperatives, the Common Interest Community Board shall issue an order relieving the declarant of any further obligation to file annual reports. After such order is issued, so long as the declarant is offering any cooperative interests for sale, the Common Interest Community Board has jurisdiction over the declarant's activities but has no other authority to regulate the cooperative.\n\n1982, c. 277, § 55-504; 2019, c. 712.",
