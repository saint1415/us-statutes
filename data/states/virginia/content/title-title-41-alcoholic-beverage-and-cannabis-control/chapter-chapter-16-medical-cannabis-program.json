The Board shall require pharmaceutical processors, after processing and before dispensing any cannabis products, to make a sample available from each batch of cannabis product for testing by an independent laboratory that is located in Commonwealth and meets Board requirements. A valid sample size for testing shall be determined by each laboratory and may vary due to sample matrix, analytical method, and laboratory-specific procedures. A minimum sample size of 0.5 percent of individual units for dispensing or distribution from each homogenized batch of cannabis oil is required to achieve a representative cannabis oil sample for analysis. A minimum sample size, to be determined by the certified testing laboratory, from each batch of botanical cannabis is required to achieve a representative botanical cannabis sample for analysis. Botanical cannabis products shall only be tested for the following: total cannabidiol (CBD), total tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), terpenes, pesticide chemical residue, heavy metals, mycotoxins, moisture, and microbiological contaminants. Testing thresholds shall be consistent with generally accepted cannabis industry thresholds. The pharmaceutical processor may remediate botanical cannabis or cannabis oil that fails any quality testing standard except pesticides. Following remediation, all remediated botanical cannabis or cannabis oil shall be subject to laboratory testing, which shall not be more stringent than initial testing prior to remediation. Remediated botanical cannabis or cannabis oil that passes such quality testing may be packaged and labeled. If a batch of botanical cannabis fails retesting after remediation, it shall be considered usable cannabis and may be processed into cannabis oil. Stability testing shall not be required for any cannabis product with an expiration date assigned by the pharmaceutical processor of 12 months or less from the date of the cannabis product registration approval. Stability testing required for assignment of an expiration date longer than 12 months shall be limited to microbial testing, on a pass/fail basis, and potency testing, on a 15 percent deviation basis, of total THC and total CBD. No cannabis product shall have an expiration date longer than 12 months from the date of the cannabis product registration approval unless supported by stability testing.\n\nE. A laboratory testing samples for a pharmaceutical processor shall obtain a controlled substances registration certificate pursuant to § 54.1-3423 and shall comply with quality standards established by the Board of Pharmacy in regulation.\n\nF. Every pharmaceutical processor's dispensing area or cannabis dispensing facility shall be under the personal supervision of a licensed pharmacist on the premises of the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility unless all cannabis products are contained in a vault or other similar container to which only the pharmacist has access controls. The pharmaceutical processor shall ensure that security measures are adequate to protect the cannabis from diversion at all times, and the pharmacist-in-charge shall have concurrent responsibility for preventing diversion from the dispensing area.\n\nEvery pharmaceutical processor shall designate a person who shall have oversight of the cultivation and production areas of the pharmaceutical processor and shall provide such information to the Board. The Board shall direct all communications related to enforcement of requirements related to cultivation and production of cannabis and cannabis products by the pharmaceutical processor to such designated person.\n\nG. The Board shall require the material owners of an applicant for a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility permit to submit to fingerprinting and provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with his fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding the applicant's material owners. The cost of fingerprinting and the criminal history record search shall be paid by the applicant. The Central Criminal Records Exchange shall forward the results of the criminal history background check to the Board or its designee, which shall be a governmental entity.\n\nH. A pharmaceutical processor shall maintain evidence of criminal background checks for all employees and delivery agents of the pharmaceutical processor. Criminal background checks of employees and delivery agents may be conducted by any service sufficient to disclose any federal and state criminal convictions.\n\nI. In addition to other employees authorized by the Board, a pharmaceutical processor may employ individuals who may have less than one year of experience (i) to perform cultivation-related duties under the supervision of an individual who has received a degree in a field related to the cultivation of plants or a certification recognized by the Board or who has at least one year of experience cultivating plants, (ii) to perform extraction-related duties under the supervision of an individual who has a degree in chemistry or pharmacology or at least one year of experience extracting chemicals from plants, (iii) to perform duties at the pharmaceutical processor and cannabis dispensing facility upon certification as a pharmacy technician, and (iv) to serve as pharmacy technician trainees.\n\nJ. A pharmaceutical processor to whom a permit has been issued by the Board may (i) establish up to five cannabis dispensing facilities, subject to the permit requirement set forth in subsection B, for the dispensing of cannabis products that have been cultivated and produced on the premises of a pharmaceutical processor permitted by the Board and (ii) establish, if authorized by the Board, one additional location at which the pharmaceutical processor may cultivate cannabis plants. Each cannabis dispensing facility and the additional cultivation location shall be located within the same health service area as the pharmaceutical processor.\n\nK. No person who has been convicted of a felony under the laws of the Commonwealth or another jurisdiction within the last five years shall be employed by or act as an agent of a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility.\n\nL. Every pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall adopt policies for pre-employment drug screening and regular, ongoing, random drug screening of employees.\n\nM. A pharmacist at the pharmaceutical processor's dispensing area and the cannabis dispensing facility shall determine the number of pharmacy interns, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy technician trainees who can be safely and competently supervised at one time; however, no pharmacist shall supervise more than six persons performing the duties of a pharmacy technician at one time in the pharmaceutical processor's dispensing area or cannabis dispensing facility.\n\nN. A pharmaceutical processor may acquire from a registered industrial hemp handler or processor industrial hemp extracts that (i) are grown and processed in Virginia in compliance with state or federal law, and (ii) notwithstanding the tetrahydrocannabinol limits set forth in the definition of \"industrial hemp extract\" in § 3.2-5145.1, contain a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no greater than 0.3 percent. A pharmaceutical processor may process and formulate such extracts into an allowable dosage of cannabis product. Industrial hemp extracts acquired and formulated by a pharmaceutical processor are subject to the same third-party testing requirements that may apply to cannabis plant extract. Testing shall be performed by a laboratory located in Virginia and in compliance with state law governing the testing of cannabis products. The industrial hemp handler or processor shall provide such third-party testing results to the pharmaceutical processor before industrial hemp extracts may be acquired.\n\nO.

The Board may summarily suspend or restrict a permit issued pursuant to § 4.1-1602 without a hearing if the Board finds that such suspension or restriction is necessary to prevent substantial danger to public health or safety. The Board shall make decisions to summarily suspend or restrict a permit only during an in-person meeting in which a quorum is present; however, if, after a good faith effort, the Board is unable to assemble a quorum and a majority of the Board members determine that continued operation by the permittee constitutes a substantial danger to public health or safety, the Board may summarily suspend the permit during a telephone, video, or other electronic conference. Institution of proceedings for a hearing shall be provided simultaneously with a summary suspension. The Board may summarily restrict a permit without proceeding simultaneously with notification of an informal conference pursuant to § 2.2-4019 or Board regulations. Such hearing or conference shall be held within a reasonable amount of time after the summary suspension or restriction is issued.\n\nB. Allegations of violations of this subtitle shall be submitted to the Board in writing.\n\n2023, cc. 740, 773.",

      "heading": "Confidentiality of reports, information, and records; penalty",
      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any reports, information, or records received or maintained by the Board regarding active investigations or disciplinary proceedings for violations of this chapter shall be strictly confidential. The Board may only disclose such confidential information:\n\n1. In a disciplinary proceeding before a health regulatory board or in any subsequent trial or appeal of an action or order;\n\n2. To the permittee when entering into a confidential consent agreement;\n\n3. To regulatory authorities tasked with granting, limiting, or denying licenses, certificates, or registrations to practice a health profession;\n\n4. Pursuant to a court order for good cause arising from extraordinary circumstances;\n\n5. To qualified personnel for bona fide research or educational purposes, provided that identifying information is redacted and the information is released pursuant to a written agreement that ensures compliance with this section;\n\n6. To the Health Practitioners' Monitoring Program within the Department of Health Professions for the purpose of evaluating health practitioners who have applied to or participate in the Program; or\n\n7. To the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission pursuant to § 30-59.\n\nB. In no event shall confidential information received, maintained, or developed by the Board or disclosed by the Board to others pursuant to this section be available for discovery or court subpoena or introduced into evidence in any civil action. This section shall not, however, be construed to inhibit an investigation or prosecution under Article 1 (§ 18.2-247 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2.\n\nC. Any claim of a practitioner-patient privilege shall not prevail in any investigation or proceeding by the Board when acting within the scope of its authority. However, the disclosure of any information pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a waiver of such privilege in any other proceeding.\n\nD. This section shall not prohibit the Board, after consultation with the relevant health regulatory board president or his designee, from disclosing to the Attorney General, or the appropriate attorney for the Commonwealth, investigatory information that indicates a possible violation of any provision of criminal law, including the laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, prescribing, or administration of drugs, other than drugs classified as Schedule VI drugs and devices, by any individual regulated by the Board or any health regulatory board.\n\nE. This section shall not prohibit the Board from (i) disclosing information regarding any (a) disciplinary action taken against a person holding a permit issued pursuant to this chapter in another state or in a federal health institution or any voluntary surrender of a license in another state while under investigation; (b) malpractice judgment against a person holding a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; or (c) settlement of a malpractice claim against a person holding a permit issued pursuant to this chapter or (ii) making any report of aggregate, non-identifying information.\n\nF. This section shall not prohibit the Board, following consultation with any relevant health regulatory board president or his designee, from (i) disclosing information about a suspected violation of state or federal law or regulation to agencies within the Health and Human Resources Secretariat or to state or federal law-enforcement agencies having jurisdiction over the suspected violation or (ii) requesting an inspection or investigation of a permittee by such state or federal agency when the Board has reason to believe that a possible violation of state or federal law has occurred. Such disclosure shall not exceed the minimum information necessary to permit the state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the suspected violation of state or federal law or regulation to conduct an inspection or investigation. Disclosures by the Board pursuant to this subsection shall not be limited to requests for inspections or investigations of permittees. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the Board to make any disclosure or to permit any agency to which the Board makes a disclosure to re-disclose any information, reports, records, or materials received from the Board.\n\nG. Whenever a complaint has been filed about a permittee under this chapter, the Board shall provide information to the source and the subject of the complaint regarding investigative and disciplinary procedures. Prior to interviewing a permittee who is the subject of a complaint, or at the time that the permittee is first notified in writing of the complaint, whichever occurs first, the Board shall provide the permittee with a copy of the complaint and any records or supporting documentation, unless such provision would materially obstruct a criminal or regulatory investigation. If the Board concludes that a disciplinary proceeding will not be instituted, the Board may send an advisory letter to the person who was the subject of the complaint. The Board may also inform the source of the complaint (i) that an investigation has been conducted, (ii) that the matter was concluded without a disciplinary proceeding, (iii) of the process the Board followed in making its determination, and (iv) if appropriate, that an advisory letter from the Board has been communicated to the person who was the subject of the complaint. In providing such information, the Board shall inform the source of the complaint that he is subject to the requirements of this section relating to confidentiality and discovery.\n\nH. Orders and notices of the Board relating to disciplinary actions, other than confidential exhibits described in subsection I, shall be disclosed. The Board shall provide to the source of the complaint (i) information regarding the date and location of any disciplinary proceeding, allegations against the permittee, and the list of statutes and regulations the permittee is alleged to have violated prior to the proceeding and (ii) notice of the disposition of the disciplinary case.\n\nI. In disciplinary actions in which a practitioner is or may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients and the public because of a mental or physical disability, the Board shall consider whether to disclose and may decide not to disclose the practitioner's health records or services. Such information may be considered by the Board in a closed hearing and included in a confidential exhibit to a notice or order. The public notice or order shall identify, if known, the practitioner's mental or physical disability that is the basis for its determination. In the event that the Board determines that information should be withheld pursuant to this subsection, information contained in the confidential exhibit shall remain part of the Board's confidential record and is subject to court review under the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) and to release in accordance with this section.\n\nJ. This section shall not prohibit investigative staff authorized under § 54.1-2506 or investigative staff of any other agency to which disclosure of information about a suspected violation of state or federal law or regulation is authorized by subsection F from interviewing fact witnesses, disclosing to fact witnesses the identity of the subject of the complaint, or reviewing with fact witnesses any portion of records or other supporting documentation necessary to refresh the fact witnesses' recollection.\n\nK. The provisions of this section shall apply only to information collected or maintained by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\n\nL. Any person that discloses confidential information of the Board in violation of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n\n2024, c. 732.",
