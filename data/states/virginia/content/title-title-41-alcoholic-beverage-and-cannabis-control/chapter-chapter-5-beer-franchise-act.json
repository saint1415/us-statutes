The use of general corporate logos or symbols or the use of advertising messages, whether appearing on the product packaging or elsewhere, shall not be considered to be a brand, brand extension, or part thereof as these terms are used in this chapter.\n\n\"Brand extension\" and \"extension of a brand\" mean any brand, which incorporates all or a substantial part of the unique features of a preexisting brand of the same brewery and which relies to a significant extent on the goodwill associated with such preexisting brand.\n\n\"Brewery\" means every person, including any authorized representative of such person pursuant to § 4.1-218 which (i) is licensed as a brewery located within the Commonwealth, (ii) holds a beer importer's license and is not simultaneously licensed as a beer wholesaler, or (iii) manufactures any malt beverage, has title to any malt beverage products excluding licensed Virginia wholesalers and retailers or has the contractual right to distribute under its own brand any malt beverage product whether licensed in the Commonwealth or not, who enters into an agreement with any beer wholesaler licensed to do business in the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Dual distributorships\" means the existence of agreements between a single brewery and more than one wholesaler in a given territory as the result of a purchase of another brewery.\n\n\"Nonsurviving brewery\" means any brewery which is purchased by another brewery as provided in § 4.1-504 and, as a result, ceases to exist as an independent legal entity.\n\n\"Person\" means a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust, agency, or other entity as well as the individual officers, directors or other persons in active control of the activities of each such entity. \"Person\" also includes heirs, assigns, personal representatives and conservators.\n\n\"Purchase\" includes, but is not limited to, the sale of stock, sale of assets, merger, lease, transfer or consolidation.\n\n\"Surviving brewery\" means a brewery which purchases a nonsurviving brewery as provided in § 4.1-504.\n\n\"Territory\" or \"sales territory\" means the area of sales responsibility within the Commonwealth expressly or impliedly designated by any agreement between any beer wholesaler and brewery for the brand or brands of any brewer.\n\n1978, c. 579, § 4-118.4; 1985, c. 549; 1987, c. 247; 1991, c. 628; 1993, c. 866; 1997, c. 801.",

The purchaser of a brand from a brewery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling brewery's agreement with distributors concerning that brand. Whenever such a purchase of a brand results in the creation of a dual distributorship, the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 of subsection B will determine the distribution rights to such brand or any extension thereof. For the limited purpose of making such determination, the brewery selling such brand shall be a nonsurviving brewery and the purchaser shall be a surviving brewery.\n\nB. For purposes of this section, when a purchase of a brewery by or on behalf of another brewery causes the selling brewery to cease to exist as an independent legal entity, the selling brewery shall be regarded as a nonsurviving brewery and the brewery on whose behalf the purchase was made shall be regarded as a surviving brewery. The following rules shall apply in order to determine (i) the distribution rights to any brands which are first marketed in the Commonwealth by the surviving brewery on or after July 1, 1985, with respect to a dual distributorship created prior to July 1, 1985, and (ii) the distribution rights to any brands, regardless of when they were first marketed in the Commonwealth, with respect to a dual distributorship created on or after July 1, 1985:\n\n1. If the surviving brewery distributes in the Commonwealth any brand or brands of the nonsurviving brewery which that brewery marketed in the Commonwealth at any time during the one-year period ending on the day the purchase agreement was made, these brands shall be distributed through those beer wholesalers who were distributors in the Commonwealth for the nonsurviving brewery. Any brands which the surviving brewery had marketed in the Commonwealth prior to the purchase shall be distributed through those beer wholesalers who were wholesalers of the surviving brewery prior to the purchase.\n\n2. If the surviving brewery decides to market in the Commonwealth a new brand which is clearly an extension of a brand already assigned to beer wholesalers in the Commonwealth, the new brand shall be distributed through those wholesalers who distribute the brand of which the new brand is an extension.\n\n3. If the surviving brewery decides to introduce in the Commonwealth a new brand which was not marketed in the Commonwealth at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the purchase agreement was made and which is not a brand extension, the surviving brewery shall market the new brand either through a distributor of the nonsurviving brewery or through a distributor who was a distributor of the surviving brewery prior to the purchase, as the brewery may see fit in any territory.\n\nC. Subsection B shall not apply to determine distributorship rights to any brands or brand extensions which were marketed in the Commonwealth prior to July 1, 1985, with respect to any dual distributorship created prior to July 1, 1985.\n\n1985, c. 549, § 4-118.6:1; 1993, c. 866.",

Failure by the wholesaler to substantially comply, without reasonable excuse or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him in writing by the brewery, including, but not limited to, a substantial failure by a beer wholesaler to (i) maintain a sales volume of his brewery's brand or brands, (ii) render services comparable in quality, quantity or volume to the sales volumes maintained and services rendered by other wholesalers of the same brand or brands within the Commonwealth, or (iii) failure to obtain the consent of the brewery to a transfer of a wholesaler's business unless a determination has been made by the Board pursuant to § 4.1-507 that such consent was unreasonably withheld by the brewery. In any determination as to whether a wholesaler has failed to substantially comply, without reasonable excuse or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him by the brewery, consideration shall be given to the relative size, population, geographical location, number of retail outlets and demand for the products applicable to the territory of the wholesaler in question and to comparable territories.\n\nGood cause shall not be construed to exist without a finding of a material deficiency for which the wholesaler is responsible in any case in which good cause is alleged to exist based on circumstances not specifically set forth in subdivisions 1 through 4 of this section.\n\n1978, c. 579, § 4-118.7; 1985, c. 549; 1987, c. 247; 1989, c. 272; 1993, c. 866; 1996, c. 3.",

A copy of the notice shall be mailed at the same time to the Board. If such condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler, then the proposed amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect.

Reasonable compensation shall include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n1. The fair market value of the assets used by the wholesaler specifically for the purpose of distributing the brewery's products;\n\n2. The cost of the wholesaler's inventory of the brewery's products calculated as the sum of the net price paid by the wholesaler for the inventory;\n\n3.
