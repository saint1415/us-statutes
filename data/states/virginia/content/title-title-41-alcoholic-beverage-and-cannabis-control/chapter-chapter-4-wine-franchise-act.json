The purchaser of a brand from a winery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling winery's agreements with wholesalers concerning that brand. Whenever such a purchase of a brand results in the creation of a dual distributorship, the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 of subsection B will determine the distribution rights to such brand or any extension thereof.

For purposes of this section, when a purchase of a winery by or on behalf of another winery causes the selling winery to cease to exist as an independent legal entity, the selling winery shall be regarded as a nonsurviving winery, and the winery on whose behalf the purchase was made shall be regarded as a surviving winery. In any case in which such a purchase of a winery by or on behalf of another winery has created or will create a dual distributorship, the following rules shall apply in order to determine the allocation of any brands which are first marketed in the Commonwealth by the surviving winery after February 18, 1989:\n\n1. If the surviving winery distributes in the Commonwealth brands of the nonsurviving winery which that winery marketed anywhere prior to the purchase, these brands shall be distributed through any wholesalers who were distributors in the Commonwealth for the nonsurviving winery. If the nonsurviving winery had no distributors in the Commonwealth, then the surviving winery's brands, as well as the brands of the surviving winery which were marketed anywhere prior to the purchase, shall be distributed through those wine wholesalers who were wholesalers of the surviving winery prior to the purchase.\n\n2. If the surviving winery decides to market in the Commonwealth a new brand which was not marketed anywhere prior to the purchase, but which is clearly an extension of a brand which did exist prior to the purchase, the new brand shall be distributed through those wholesalers who distributed the brand of which the new brand is an extension.\n\n3.

Good cause shall not include the sale or purchase of a winery. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to the following:\n\n1. Revocation of the wholesaler's license to do business in the Commonwealth;\n\n2. Bankruptcy or receivership of the wholesaler;\n\n3.

Failure by the wholesaler to substantially comply, without reasonable cause or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him in writing by the winery including, but not limited to, a substantial failure by a wine wholesaler to (i) maintain a sales volume or trend of his winery's brand or brands comparable to that of other distributors of that brand in the Commonwealth similarly situated or (ii) render services comparable in quality, quantity or volume to the services rendered by other wholesalers of the same brand or brands within the Commonwealth similarly situated. In any determination as to whether a wholesaler has failed to substantially comply, without reasonable excuse or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him by the winery, consideration shall be given to the relative size, population, geographical location, number of retail outlets and demand for the products applicable to the territory of the wholesaler in question and to comparable territories.\n\nNothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a winery from proposing or effecting an amendment to a contract with a wine wholesaler in the Commonwealth provided that such amendment is not inconsistent with this chapter.\n\nGood cause shall not be construed to exist without a finding of a material deficiency for which the wholesaler is responsible in any case in which good cause is alleged to exist based on circumstances not specifically set forth in subdivisions 1 through 4 of this section.\n\nCode 1950, § 4-118.27; 1985, c. 542, § 4-118.47; 1987, c. 246; 1989, c. 10; 1993, c. 866; 1996, c. 3.",

After providing such notice, a winery may immediately apply to the Board for a determination that it is likely to incur substantial hardship if required to comply with the ninety-day notice requirement. If the Board makes such a determination, the ninety-day notice requirement shall be reduced to thirty days. In this event, the thirty-day notice period shall be included in the sixty-day opportunity to cure period provided in subsection B.\n\nB.

A copy of the notice shall be mailed at the same time to the Board. If such condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler, then the proposed amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect. However, where the winery contends that action on the part of the wholesaler has not rectified one or more of such conditions, the winery must within fifteen days after the expiration of the sixty-day period request a hearing before the Board to determine if the condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler.\n\nC. Where the reason relates to a condition which may not be rectified by the wholesaler within the sixty-day period, the wholesaler may request a hearing before the Board to determine if there is good cause for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of the agreement.\n\nD. Upon request in writing within the ninety-day period provided in subsection A from such winery or wholesaler for a hearing, the Board shall, after notice and hearing, determine if the action of the wholesaler has rectified the condition or, as the case may be, if good cause exists for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of the agreement.\n\nE. In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section in which the existence of good cause is an issue, the winery shall have the burden of proving the existence of good cause.

However, where a petition is made to the Board after the agreement has been terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, the filing of the petition shall not cause the terminated agreement to be reinstated unless the terminated wholesaler's failure to petition in a timely manner was based upon reasonable reliance on representation or other inducements made by the winery.\n\nF. No notice shall be required and an agreement may be immediately amended, terminated, cancelled or allowed to expire if the reason for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal is:\n\n1. The bankruptcy or receivership of the wholesaler;\n\n2.

Reasonable compensation shall include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n1. The fair market value of the assets used by the wholesaler specifically for the purpose of distributing the winery's products;\n\n2.
