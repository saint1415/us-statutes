The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.\n\nThe proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the airport project or projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional airport project or projects.\n\nPrior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.\n\n1980, c. 750; 1982, c. 563.",

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the airport project or projects.\n\n1980, c. 750.",

Whenever any abandoned or derelict aircraft is found or located on premises owned or controlled by the operator of an airport, the operator of the airport or his designee shall make a record of the date the aircraft was found or determined to be present on the airport premises.\n\nC. The airport operator or his designee shall contact the Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Registration Branch, to determine the name and address of the last registered owner of the aircraft and shall make a diligent search of available records, or contact an aircraft title search company, to determine the name and address of any person having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft. Within 30 calendar days after receipt of such information, the airport operator or his designee shall notify the owner and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the location of the abandoned or derelict aircraft on the airport premises; any fees and charges for the use of the airport by the aircraft that have accrued and the amount thereof; if the aircraft is subject to a lien under subsection F for the accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft; that the lien is subject to enforcement pursuant to law; and that the airport may cause the use, trade, sale, or removal of the aircraft if, within 90 calendar days after the date of receipt of such notice, the aircraft has not been removed from the airport upon payment in full of all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft.\n\nD. If the owner of the aircraft is unknown or cannot be found, the airport operator or his designee shall cause a laminated notice, in a form prescribed by the Board, to be placed conspicuously upon a window of such aircraft stating that the aircraft is unlawfully upon the airport's property, has accrued fees and charges for the use of such property, and those fees must be paid in full and the property removed within 90 calendar days of the date of the notice or the property will be removed or disposed of. The notice shall also provide that the aircraft is subject to a lien for all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, as well as the publication of such notice. The notice shall include the date of posting. Such notice shall be not less than eight inches by 10 inches and shall be sufficiently weatherproof to withstand normal exposure to the weather. If, at the end of 90 calendar days after posting the notice, the owner or any person having an equitable or legal interest in the described abandoned or derelict aircraft has not removed the aircraft from the airport upon payment in full or entry into a written payment plan for all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, or shown reasonable cause for failure to do so, the airport operator or his designee may dispose of the aircraft as provided in subsection E.\n\nE. Such abandoned or derelict aircraft shall be removed within the time period specified in the notice provided under subsection C or D. If, at the end of such time period, the owner or any person having an equitable or legal interest in the described abandoned or derelict aircraft has not removed the aircraft from the airport upon payment in full or entry into a written payment plan for all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, or shown reasonable cause for the failure to do so, the airport operator or his designee may (i) retain such aircraft or any part thereof for use by the airport; (ii) trade such aircraft to another airport operator, the Commonwealth, or a subdivision thereof; (iii) sell such aircraft at public auction; or (iv) dispose of such aircraft through an appropriate refuse removal company or a company that provides salvage services for aircraft.\n\n1. If the airport elects to sell the aircraft, the aircraft must be sold at public auction after (i) giving notice of the time and place of sale twice, once no less than 30 calendar days and once no less than 10 calendar days prior to the date of sale, in a publication of general circulation within the county or city where the airport is located; (ii) posting notice of the time and place of sale in the airport no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date of sale; and (iii) after providing written notice of the intended sale to all parties known to have an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft.\n\n2. If the airport elects to dispose of the aircraft as provided in clause (iv), the airport shall be entitled to negotiate with the company for a price to be received from such company in payment for the aircraft, or, if circumstances so warrant, a price to be paid to such company by the airport for the costs of disposing of the aircraft. All information pertaining to the establishment of such price and the justification for the amount of such price shall be prepared and maintained by the airport, and such negotiated price shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable price.\n\n3. If the sale price or the negotiated price is less than the airport's then current charges and costs against the aircraft or if the airport is required to pay the salvage company for its services, the owner of the aircraft shall remain liable to the airport for the airport's costs that are not offset by the sale price or negotiated price, in addition to the owner's liability for payment to the airport of the price the airport was required to pay any salvage company. All costs incurred by the airport in the removal, storage, and sale of any aircraft shall be recoverable against the owner of the aircraft, including attorney fees.\n\n4. If the sale price or the negotiated price is greater than the airport's then current charges and costs against the aircraft, the surplus of the proceeds of the sale or negotiated price shall be distributed to the owner of the aircraft and all parties known to have an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft by priority.\n\nF. The airport shall have a lien on an abandoned or derelict aircraft for all fees and charges for the use of the airport by such aircraft and for all fees and charges incurred by the airport for the transportation, storage, and removal of such aircraft. As a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this section, the airport operator or his designee shall serve a notice on the last registered owner and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft. Serving the notice does not dispense with recording the claim of lien.\n\nG. For the purpose of perfecting its lien under this section, the airport shall record a claim of lien that shall state:\n\n1. The name and address of the airport;\n\n2. The name of the last registered owner of the aircraft and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft;\n\n3. The dates upon which the lien is claimed by the airport;\n\n4. The fees and charges incurred by the aircraft for the use of the airport and the fees and charges for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, including attorney fees and post-judgment interest at six percent annually; and\n\n5. A description of the aircraft sufficient for identification.\n\nThe claim of lien shall be signed and sworn to or affirmed by the airport operator or his designee and served on the last registered owner of the aircraft and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft. The claim of lien shall be so served before recordation.\n\nThe claim of lien shall be recorded with the clerk of court in the county or city where the airport is located. The recording of the claim of lien shall be constructive notice to all persons of the contents and effect of such claim. The lien shall attach at the time of recordation and shall take priority as of that time.\n\nH. A purchaser or recipient in good faith of an aircraft sold or obtained under this section takes the property free of the rights of persons then holding any equitable or legal interest in the aircraft, whether or not recorded. The purchaser or recipient is required to notify the appropriate Federal Aviation Administration office of such change in the registered owner of the aircraft.\n\nI. If the aircraft is sold at public sale, the airport shall deduct from the proceeds of sale the costs of transportation, storage, publication of notice, and all other costs reasonably incurred by the airport, including attorney fees, and any balance of the proceeds shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account not later than 30 calendar days after the airport's receipt of the proceeds and held there for one year. The rightful owner of the aircraft may claim the balance of the proceeds within one year after the date of the deposit by making application to the airport and presenting acceptable written evidence of ownership to the airport operator or his designee. If no rightful owner claims the proceeds within the one-year period, the balance of the proceeds shall be retained by the airport to be used in any manner authorized by law.\n\nJ. Any person acquiring a legal interest in an aircraft that is sold by an airport under this section shall be the lawful owner of such aircraft and all other equitable or legal interests in such aircraft shall be divested and of no further force and effect, provided that the holder of any such equitable or legal interests was notified of the intended disposal of the aircraft to the extent required in this section. The airport may issue documents of disposition to the purchaser or recipient of an aircraft disposed of under this section.\n\nK. The provisions of this section shall not apply to aircraft owned or operated by (i) active-duty military personnel or (ii) any person or business engaged in the commercial industry of building, modifying, inspecting, repairing, or refurbishing aircraft.\n\n2024, c. 810.",

The application therefor shall be made on the form prescribed and furnished by the Department and shall be accompanied by a fee not exceeding $100.\n\nSuch license shall be issued for a period not to exceed seven years and shall be renewed every seven years. Before issuing such license, the Department shall require the holder of such license to furnish proof of financial responsibility prescribed in Chapter 8.2 (§ 5.1-88.7 et seq.).\n\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to operate any airport or landing area which is open to the general public for the landing or departure of any aircraft until a license therefor shall be issued by the Department.\n\nBefore issuing such license for the establishment of a new airport, the Department shall investigate the location of such airport or landing area with the relation to its proximity to and its runway orientation in relation to any other airport or landing area and shall provide for the safety of civil aircraft alighting thereon or departing therefrom. If the proposed airport or landing area shall be so situated as to endanger aircraft using the same or any other airport or landing area in close proximity, and if proper provisions have not been made in all other respects for the safety of aircraft alighting thereon or departing therefrom, the license shall not be granted. To be licensed, an airport required to be licensed under § 5.1-7.2 must meet this criterion and any applicable requirement provided for in regulation promulgated under this section, but no others.\n\nThe Board may, by regulation, adopt any other requirements for licensure that are related to the safety of civil aircraft using such airport or landing area. Any airport having a license issued prior to October 1, 1995, and not meeting one or more minimum standards as defined in Part III (24VAC5-20-120 et seq.) of the Virginia Aviation Regulations, shall be exempt from having to comply with those noncomplying standards for as long as the airport remains an active public-use facility unless those noncomplying standards are caused by natural growth. Should such airport cease to be open to the public for one year, and subsequently reopen, it shall be required to comply with all applicable minimum standards for licensure.\n\nIn addition to the above safety requirements, before a license is initially issued, the Department shall consider the reviews and comments of appropriate state agencies coordinated by the Department of Environmental Quality, and shall cause a public hearing to be held concerning the economic, social and environmental effects of the location or runway orientation of the airport or landing area if the facility is listed in the Virginia Air Transportation System Plan; however, such coordinated review by the Department of Environmental Quality shall not exceed 90 days after the Department has requested review by the Department of Environmental Quality. The public hearing required by this section shall be conducted by the Department of Environmental Quality in the jurisdiction in which the airport or landing area is located, after publication of notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in such jurisdiction at least 10 days in advance of such hearing.\n\nAny license issued shall describe the number of runways, the length and orientation of each runway and/or, if appropriate, the landing area.\n\nIf a runway is to be extended or new runways are to be added, a revised license shall be applied for from the Department. If the airport or landing area is listed in the Virginia Air Transportation System Plan, the Department shall consider the reviews and comments of appropriate state agencies, coordinated by the Department of Environmental Quality, and shall cause a public hearing to be held concerning the economic, social and environmental effects of such changes to the license.\n\nWhenever a public hearing is called for herein, if there has been a public hearing associated with the development of any environmental documents to comply with the receipt of federal funds, the Department and the Department of Environmental Quality may rely on such document or hearing in carrying out their respective duties set out in this section.\n\nIf an airport or landing area cannot meet the requirements for licensure that have been adopted by the Virginia Aviation Board, or having met those requirements cannot maintain compliance, the Department may issue conditional licenses to allow time for the airport or landing areas to take steps to meet those requirements or may revoke any license issued, if requirements for licensure are not met or cannot be met.\n\nAny party aggrieved by the granting or refusal to grant any such license shall have a right of appeal to the circuit court of the jurisdiction where the airport or landing area is to be located, which appeal shall be filed in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).\n\nAll airports or landing areas that hold licenses or permits shall be issued new licenses, without charge, on or before October 1, 1995, describing the number, length and orientation of the runway or runways or, if appropriate, the landing area, which shall be valid for up to seven years. The length of the new license term may be staggered so that all licenses will not become renewable at the same time.
