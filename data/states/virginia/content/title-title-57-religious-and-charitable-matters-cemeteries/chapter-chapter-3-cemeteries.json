No landowner shall erect a wall, fence or other structure or device that prevents ingress and egress to the cemetery or grave, unless the wall, fence or other structure or device has a gate or other means by which ingress and egress can be accomplished by persons specified in this subsection.

The surveying costs, including the cost of the survey and of preparing the original and one copy of the plat, shall be shared equally by the petitioner and the property owner.\n\nC.

The immediate family member or descendant may prove kinship to a deceased person buried in the family cemetery by proffering official documentation or evidence of kinship or nonofficial documentation, such as obituaries, family Bibles or other documents with family signatures, journals or letters of the deceased family person, family photographs, or other official or nonofficial documentation deemed by the court to be reliable.\n\nD.

Each pet cemetery operator shall establish in a bank, savings and loan or other federally insured investment banking institution doing business in the Commonwealth an irrevocable trust fund in the amount of at least $12,000 before the first lot, parcel of land, burial or interment right is sold. This fund shall be designated the perpetual care fund.\n\nC. The moneys of a perpetual care fund shall be invested as provided by § 2.2-4519, Article 9 (§ 64.2-780 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 64.2, and §§ 64.2-1502 through 64.2-1506, except as provided otherwise herein.\n\nD.

Annual reports of all the assets and investments of the perpetual care fund shall be prepared and maintained by the operator, and shall be available for inspection at reasonable times to any owner of a burial right in the pet cemetery.

After a declaration has been filed pursuant to § 57-39.21, the restriction may be removed in accordance with this section by order of the circuit court for the locality where the land is located in a proceeding brought by the pet cemetery owner or his heirs or assigns.\n\nB. The circuit court may remove the restriction on the land upon proof satisfactory to the court that either of the following has occurred:\n\n1. No interments have been made in the land from which the restriction is sought to be removed; or\n\n2. If, after notice sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of a person who owns a burial right in a pet cemetery, the owner of the pet cemetery has received from such persons written authorization, acknowledged before a notary public, to remove the restriction from the land. If no response is received by the cemetery owner after thirty days from the date of the notice, consent to remove the restriction from the land shall be presumed. Any person granting this authorization who wishes to have a pet that is already interred in the pet cemetery removed and reinterred elsewhere shall so state on the authorization, and the pet cemetery owner shall provide proof of this removal and reinterment. A pet cemetery owner need not obtain the authorization described in this subdivision from a person who has purchased a burial right in the pet cemetery but who has not yet used that right for the interment of a pet, if the owner refunds to the purchaser or his heirs or assigns all moneys taken for the burial right, plus interest accrued in six-month increments, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve Board discount rate as of January 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 1996.\n\nC. A holder of a lien on the restricted land may object to the removal of the restriction, and the circuit court shall consider any such objection before issuing an order to remove the restriction.\n\nD. An order issued by the circuit court removing a restriction pursuant to this section shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court for the locality where the land is located. The clerk shall record the order in the deed book.\n\n1996, c. 957.",
