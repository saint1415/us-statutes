A summary plan description (SPD) that contains all or substantially all the information an average member would deem crucial to possess a knowledgeable understanding of his benefits under the plan;\n\n2. A statement of benefits that indicates, on the basis of the latest available information: (i) his total accrued benefits and (ii) his nonforfeitable accrued retirement benefits, if any, or the earliest date on which benefits will become nonforfeitable; and\n\n3. A document disclosing material soft dollar transactions (arrangements not negotiated at arm's length or dealings between the retirement systems' fund managers and persons providing services to the systems for noncash considerations) in which the fund managers have engaged. \"Material\" means transactions wherein it could be asserted that a conflict of interests or an appearance of impropriety was a factor in making the determination of which outside provider of services would be contracted and which involved a transaction or course of dealings involving $10,000 or more. This disclosure document shall not be a part of the retirement system's annual report, but shall be prepared as an annual supplement and made available to the public upon request. Local retirement systems may publish such disclosure document with their annual reports.\n\n1990, c. 706; 1991, c. 612; 2004, c. 209.",
