The election by the governing body of an employer not to participate in this program shall be irrevocable. The employer need not consider the provisions of § 51.1-1178 when determining the comparability of its disability coverage to this program. As the context requires, the term \"participating employee\" includes the employees of an employer electing not to participate in the program under this subdivision.\n\n2.

Such participation shall be subject to the limitations described in § 51.1-1179, and the locality employing such eligible dispatchers shall provide the costs required for funding participation in the program pursuant to § 51.1-1183. However, if a locality made an irrevocable election not to participate in the program pursuant to subdivision 1, such dispatchers shall not become participants in the program but shall become participants in the comparable disability coverage established and maintained by the locality. An eligible dispatcher who is a participant in the program or in the disability coverage provided by a locality electing not to participate in the program shall not be eligible for disability retirement benefits pursuant to § 51.1-156.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 2, an eligible dispatcher shall not become a participant in the program or in the disability coverage provided by a locality electing not to participate in the program but shall remain subject to the provisions governing disability retirement if the eligible dispatcher was (i) awarded disability retirement benefits pursuant to § 51.1-156 prior to July 1, 2026, and continued to receive such disability retirement benefits on or after July 1, 2026, or (ii) employed on June 30, 2025, and on July 1, 2025, and made an irrevocable election no later than March 31, 2026, to remain covered by disability retirement benefits pursuant to § 51.1-156.
