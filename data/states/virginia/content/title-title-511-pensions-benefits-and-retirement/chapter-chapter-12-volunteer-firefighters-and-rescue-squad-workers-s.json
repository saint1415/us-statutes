If the eligible volunteer firefighter or volunteer who is an individual who meets the definition of \"emergency medical services personnel\" in § 32.1-111.1 ceases to serve as a volunteer and has less than five years of creditable service upon attaining age 60, such person shall not be paid, nor have any right or interest in, the amount paid into the Fund on his behalf (i) by his fire department or emergency medical services agency, (ii) from the general fund of the state treasury pursuant to § 51.1-1204, or (iii) by any local government. Such person shall, however, be paid all contributions to the Fund that he has made plus the applicable portion of any investment gains or losses thereon.\n\nThe amount paid into the Fund on his behalf by his fire department or emergency medical services agency shall remain in the Fund and shall be deemed additional contributions made by such fire department or emergency medical services agency.

The amount paid into the Fund on his behalf from a local government shall remain in the Fund and shall be deemed additional contributions from such local government.\n\n3. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to preclude any eligible volunteer firefighter or eligible volunteer emergency medical services personnel from completing the requisite number of years of active service, after attaining the age of 60, necessary to entitle him to the distribution provided for in § 51.1-1205.\n\n4. If an eligible volunteer firefighter or eligible volunteer who is an individual who meets the definition of \"emergency medical services personnel\" in § 32.1-111.1 dies before a service award is otherwise paid to him under the provisions of this chapter and while he is an eligible volunteer, there shall be paid to his beneficiary an amount equal to the contributions he has made, the matching contributions made on his behalf, and any investment gains on such contributions less any losses. If an eligible volunteer firefighter or eligible volunteer emergency medical services personnel dies before a service award is otherwise paid to him under the provisions of this chapter and while he is no longer an eligible volunteer, there shall be paid to his beneficiary an amount equal to the amount paid into the Fund by the volunteer and any investment gains on that amount, less any losses. For purposes of this section, a member's beneficiary is the person or persons the member may name on a form prepared by the Board, signed by the member and filed in a manner prescribed by the Board. If there are no such persons, then his beneficiary shall be his spouse; if there is no spouse, then his living children equally; if there are no children, then his heirs-at-law as may be determined by the Board; or if there are no heirs, then his estate, if it is administered.\n\n5. To any firefighter or emergency medical services personnel withdrawing from the Fund, upon proper application, all moneys he contributed to the Fund less any investment losses, and an administrative fee of $25.\n\n1999, cc. 664, 860; 2001, c. 672; 2002, c. 349; 2015, cc. 502, 503.",
