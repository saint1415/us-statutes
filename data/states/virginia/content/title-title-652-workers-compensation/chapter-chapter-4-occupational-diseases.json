As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \"occupational disease\" means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.\n\nB. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:\n\n1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;\n\n2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;\n\n3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;\n\n4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;\n\n5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and\n\n6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.\n\nC.

Ulceration due to chrome compound or to caustic chemical acids or alkalies and undulant fever caused by the industrial slaughtering and processing of livestock and handling of hides;\n\n5. Mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos; and\n\n6. Angiosarcoma of the liver due to vinyl chloride exposure.\n\nC. A claim for benefits pursuant to subdivision A 6 made as a result of the diagnosis of a disease listed in subsection C of § 65.2-402 shall be barred if the employee is 65 years of age or older, regardless of the date of diagnosis, communication, or last injurious exposure in employment.\n\nD. When a claim is made for benefits for a change of condition in an occupational disease, such as advance from one stage or category to another, a claim for change in condition must be filed with the Commission within three years from the date for which compensation was last paid for an earlier stage of the disease, except that a claim for benefits for a change in condition in asbestosis must be filed within two years from the date when diagnosis of the advanced stage is first communicated to the employee and no claim for benefits for an advanced stage of asbestosis shall be denied on the ground that there has been no subsequent accident. For a first or an advanced stage of asbestosis or mesothelioma, if the employee is still employed in the employment in which he was injuriously exposed, the weekly compensation rate shall be based upon the employee's weekly wage as of the date of communication of the first or advanced stage of the disease, as the case may be. If the employee is unemployed, or employed in another employment, the weekly compensation rate shall be based upon the average weekly wage of a person of the same or similar grade and character in the same class of employment in which the employee was injuriously exposed and preferably in the same locality or community on the date of communication to the employee of the advanced stage of the disease or mesothelioma. The weekly compensation rates herein provided shall be subject to the same maximums and minimums as provided in § 65.2-500.\n\nCode 1950, § 65-49; 1952, c. 205; 1960, c. 297; 1962, c. 588; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-52; 1970, c. 470; 1972, c. 612; 1974, c. 201; 1975, cc. 27, 471; 1979, cc. 80, 201; 1982, c. 82; 1983, c. 469; 1984, c. 411; 1985, c. 191; 1989, c. 502; 1990, c. 417; 1991, c. 355; 1992, c. 475; 1995, c. 324; 2005, c. 433; 2011, c. 513; 2022, cc. 497, 498.",

      "text": "A. When an employee or prospective employee, though not incapacitated for work, is found to be affected by, or susceptible to, a specific occupational disease he may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be permitted to waive in writing compensation for any aggravation of his condition that may result from his working or continuing to work in the same or similar occupation for the same employer.\n\nB. The Commission shall approve a waiver for coal worker's pneumoconiosis and silicosis only when presented with X-ray evidence from a physician qualified in the opinion of the Commission to make the determination and which demonstrates a positive diagnosis of the pneumoconiosis or the existence of a lung condition which makes the employee or prospective employee significantly more susceptible to the pneumoconiosis.\n\nC. In considering approval of a waiver, the Commission may supply any medical evidence to a disinterested physician for his opinion as to whether the employee is affected by the disease or has the preexisting condition.\n\nCode 1950, § 65-50; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-53; 1970, c. 517; 1979, c. 201; 1991, c. 355.",
