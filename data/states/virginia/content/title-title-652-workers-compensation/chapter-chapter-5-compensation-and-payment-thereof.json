Except as provided in subsections E, F and G, when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such total incapacity, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of his average weekly wages, with a minimum not less than 25 percent and a maximum of not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined herein. In any event, income benefits shall not exceed the average weekly wage of the injured employee. Any farm employer who continues to furnish benefits while the employee is incapacitated shall be given credit for the value of such benefits so furnished when computing the compensation due the employee.\n\nB. For the purpose of this section the average wage in the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Commission as follows: On or before January 1 of each year, the total wages, excluding wages of United States government employees, reported on contribution reports to the Virginia Employment Commission for the 12-month period ending the preceding June 30 shall be divided by the average monthly number of insured workers (determined by dividing the total insured workers reported for that 12-month period by 12). The average annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by 52 and the average weekly wage thus determined rounded to the nearest dollar. The average weekly wage as so determined shall be applicable for the full period during which income benefits are payable, when the date of occurrence of injury or of disablement in the case of disease falls within the year commencing with the July 1 following the date of determination.\n\nC. The minimum or the maximum weekly income benefits shall not be changed for any year unless the computation herein provided results in an increase or decrease of $2 or more, raised to the next even dollar in the level of the minimum or the maximum weekly income benefits.\n\nD. The weekly compensation on account of total and permanent incapacity as defined by subsection C of § 65.2-503 shall continue for the lifetime of the injured employee without limit as to total amount.\n\nE.

      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in § 65.2-503 or 65.2-510, or as provided in subsections B, C and D, when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such incapacity a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500. For purposes of calculating an injured employee's post-injury average weekly wage, the following rules shall apply to commissioned employees, self-employed income, and income derived from an employer in which the injured worker or their immediate family has an ownership interest: if the period of partial incapacity exists for 13 weeks or less, the injured employee's post-injury average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing the employee's total earnings during the first two weeks of partial incapacity by two, subject to retroactive adjustments as provided hereinafter. If the period of partial incapacity exists for more than 13 weeks, the injured employee's post-injury average weekly wage for each 13-week interval shall be computed by dividing the employee's total earnings during the period of partial incapacity by the number of weeks included in such period; however, if an injured employee's period of partial incapacity ends after the close of a 13-week interval but before the close of the next 13-week interval, the injured employee's post-injury average weekly wage for such portion of the subsequent 13-week interval shall be calculated by dividing the employee's total earnings during the period of partial incapacity by the number of weeks included in such period. When an injured employee is under a continuing award of temporary partial benefits, the employer or the employee shall be entitled to seek a retroactive adjustment of the temporary partial rate for the 90 days preceding the application seeking such adjustment of the temporary partial rate computed in accordance with the above method of calculation. Any resulting amount due to the employee shall be paid to the employee. Any resulting credit due to the employer may be offset dollar for dollar against future compensation benefits due the injured employee, subject to the provisions of § 65.2-520. The employee is required pursuant to § 65.2-712 to immediately disclose increases in his earnings. For all other employments, the employee's post-injury average weekly wage may, in the Commission's discretion, be calculated using the preceding formula or a week-to-week calculation. In case the partial incapacity begins after a period of total incapacity, the latter period shall be deducted from the maximum period herein allowed for partial incapacity. However, the employer shall not be required to pay, or cause to be paid, compensation under this section to any injured employee not eligible for lawful employment; nor shall any such injured employee not eligible for lawful employment who is partially incapacitated be entitled during partial incapacity to receive temporary total benefits under § 65.2-500.\n\nB.

In prescribing such standards the following factors shall be included:\n\n1. If an employee who died from a respirable (respiratory) disease was employed for ten years or more in an environment where he was injuriously exposed to such a disease, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his disease arose out of such employment, or if he became totally disabled from coal worker's pneumoconiosis or if such disease significantly contributed to his death or disability, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his death or disability was due to such disease.\n\n2. Where there is clear evidence of exposure to an occupational lung disease, the Commission may make its determination whether compensation is payable to the dependents based on the description of the employee's symptoms, X-rays, and other competent medical evidence, and the opinion of experts as to whether those symptoms reasonably described the symptoms of such an occupational disease.\n\n3. The statement as to the cause of death on a death certificate may be considered as evidence in any such cases but shall not be controlling on the Commission's findings.
