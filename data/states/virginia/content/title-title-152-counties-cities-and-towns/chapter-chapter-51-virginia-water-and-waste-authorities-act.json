The authority shall evaluate its landfill capacity annually, taking into consideration and projecting future changes in the quantity of waste disposed of in its landfill, or landfills reasonably situated or contractually obligated to accept its waste.\n\n7.

Such analysis shall be reviewed by the Board and approved by a vote of a minimum of 75 percent of the Board. The issuance of new debt shall require a vote of a minimum of 75 percent of the Board of Directors of the authority.

The powers of each authority created by the governing bodies of two or more localities shall be exercised by the number of authority board members specified in its articles of incorporation, which shall be not less than one member from each participating locality and not less than a total of five members. The board members of an authority shall be selected in the manner and for the terms provided by the agreement or ordinance or resolution or concurrent ordinances or resolutions creating the authority. One or more members of the governing body or one or more directors of an industrial or economic development authority of a locality may be appointed board members of the authority, the provisions of any other law to the contrary notwithstanding. No board member shall be appointed for a term of more than four years.

The term of each alternate shall be the same as the term of the board member for whom each serves as an alternate; however, the alternate's term shall not expire because of the board member's death, disqualification, resignation, or termination of employment with the member's political subdivision.

The authority may covenant with the entity to establish and maintain fees, rates, and charges at such levels during the term of the contract for such purposes.\n\nSuch fees, rates, and charges shall not apply to refuse generated, purchased, or utilized by any enterprise located in the service area and engaged in the business of manufacturing, mining, processing, refining, or conversion that is not disposed at or through such system.\n\nThe fees, rates, and charges may be imposed upon the owners, tenants, or occupants of each occupied lot or parcel of land that the authority determines (with the concurrence at the time of such determination of the local government in which such parcel is located) is in the service area, or portion thereof, of the system for which the authority has contracted, whether or not refuse generated from such parcel is actually delivered to such system.\n\nThe fees, rates, and charges shall be fixed in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection D of § 15.2-5136. Such fees, rates, and charges may be allocated among the owners, tenants, or occupants of each lot or parcel of land that the authority determines is in the service area, or portion thereof, of the system for which the authority has contracted. Such allocation may be based upon:\n\n1. Waste generation estimates, the average number of persons residing, working in, or otherwise connected with such premises, the type and character of such premises, or upon any combination of the foregoing factors;\n\n2. The amount of refuse delivered to such system;\n\n3. The assessed value of such parcels; or\n\n4. A combination of the foregoing.\n\nThere shall be a lien on real estate for the amount of such fees, rates, and charges as provided in § 15.2-5139. The authority is empowered by resolution or other lawful action to enforce the payment of the lien by means of the actions described in § 15.2-5138.\n\nThe power to establish such fees, rates, and charges shall be in addition to any other powers granted hereunder, and such fees, rates, and charges shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of any commission, authority, or other unit of government. The entity contracting with the authority, except to the extent that rights herein given may be restricted by the contract, either at law or in equity, by suit, mandamus, or other proceedings, may protect and enforce any and all rights granted under such contract and may force and compel the performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such contract to be performed by the authority or by any officer thereof, including without limitation the fixing, charging, and collecting of fees, rates, and charges in accordance with this chapter and such contract.\n\nSuch contract, with the irrevocable consent of the entity, may be made directly with the trustee for indebtedness issued to finance such system and provide for payment directly to such trustee. The authority may pledge fees, rates, and charges made in respect of the contract with the entity, and such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time it is made. Fees, rates, and charges so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind, in tort, contract, or otherwise, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the contract nor any assignment thereof need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority.\n\nThe requirements and restrictions of § 15.2-5121 shall not apply to any contract of the authority with respect to the system if the entity for such system will not collect refuse from the generators of the same and there are no such facilities located in the area served by the authority.\n\n1997, c. 587; 2019, c. 632.",

      "text": "A. No authority shall operate or contract for the operation of a refuse collection and disposal system for any political subdivision, or collect service charges therefor, unless the authority, and subsequently the locality's governing body find: (i) that privately owned and operated refuse collection and disposal services are not available on a voluntary basis by contract or otherwise, (ii) that the use of such privately owned services has substantially endangered the public health or has resulted in substantial public nuisance, (iii) that the privately owned refuse collection and disposal service is not able to perform the service in a reasonable and cost-efficient manner, or (iv) that operation by such authority or the contract for such operation, in spite of any potential anti-competitive effect, is important in order to provide for the development and/or operation of a regional system of refuse collection and disposal for two or more units.\n\nB. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, an authority formed under this chapter shall not operate or contract for the operation of a refuse collection and disposal system which displaces a private company engaged in the provision of refuse collection and disposal unless it provides the company with five years' notice of its decision to operate such a system. As an alternative to delaying displacement five years, the governing body or authority may pay a displaced company an amount equal to the company's preceding twelve months' gross receipts for the displaced service in the displacement area. Such five-year period shall lapse as to any private company being displaced when such company ceases to provide service within the displacement area.\n\nC. For purposes of this section, \"displace\" or \"displacement\" means an authority's provision of a system which prohibits a private company from providing the same service and which it is providing at the time the decision that will result in the displacement is made. Displace or displacement does not mean: (i) competition between the public sector and private companies for individual contracts; (ii) situations in which an authority, at the end of a contract with a private company, does not renew the contract and either awards the contract to another private company or, following a competitive process conducted in accordance with the Virginia Public Procurement Act, decides for any reason to provide such service itself; (iii) situations in which action is taken against a private company because the company has acted in a manner threatening to the public health and safety or resulting in a substantial public nuisance; (iv) situations in which action is taken against a private company because the company has materially breached its contract with the political subdivision; (v) entering into a contract with a private company to provide refuse collection and disposal so long as such contract is not entered into pursuant to an ordinance which displaces or authorizes the displacement of another private company providing refuse collection and disposal; or (vi) situations in which a private company refuses to continue operations under the terms and conditions of its existing agreement during the five-year notice period.\n\nD. An authority shall not make the findings required by subsection A or proceed to seek to operate a refuse collection and disposal system for any political subdivision that would displace a private company pursuant to subsection B until it has provided (i) public notice; (ii) a public hearing; and (iii) no less than forty-five days prior to the public hearing, written notice mailed first class to all private companies providing a refuse collection and disposal system in the political subdivision that can be identified through the political subdivision's records.\n\nE. The requirements and restrictions of this section shall not apply in any political subdivision wherein refuse collection and disposal services are being operated or contracted for by any sanitary district located therein, as of July 1, 1983.\n\nF. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a political subdivision need not comply with the requirements of this section if:\n\n1. The authority proposes to contract with the private sector for services or systems involving discarded or waste materials removed from the nonhazardous solid waste stream for recycling; or\n\n2. The authority proposes to contract with the private sector for services or systems involving collection and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and (i) the collected waste will be disposed of in a state-permitted waste management facility; (ii) the authority has a contract for services which shall be paid for through a supporting financial agreement approved by the participating locality's governing body; and (iii) such action will not displace a private company engaged in refuse collection and disposal. For purposes of this section, \"recycling\" means the process of separating a particular nonhazardous waste material from the waste stream and processing it so that it may be used again as a new material.\n\n1983, c. 155, § 15.1-1250.01; 1992, c. 247; 1993, c. 497; 1994, c. 190; 1995, c. 660; 1997, c. 587.",

After the adoption by the authority of a resolution setting forth the preliminary schedule or schedules fixing and classifying such rates, fees and charges, notice of a public hearing in accordance with § 15.2-1427 shall be published. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to the governing bodies of all localities in which such systems or facilities or any part thereof is located. After the hearing the preliminary schedule or schedules, either as originally adopted or as amended, shall be adopted and put into effect.\n\nH. A copy of the schedule or schedules of the final rates, fees and charges fixed in accordance with subsection G shall be kept on file in the office of the clerk or secretary of the governing body of each locality in which such systems or any part thereof is located, and shall be open to inspection by all interested parties.

All such connections shall be made in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the authority, which may provide for a reasonable charge for making such a connection. A private water company which purchases water from a regional authority for sale or delivery to or within a municipality may impose a charge for connection to the water company's system in the same manner, and subject to the same restrictions, as an authority may impose for connection to its water system, subject to the approval of the State Corporation Commission.\n\nB.

However, persons not served by a water supply system, as defined in § 15.2-2149, producing potable water meeting the standards established by the Virginia Department of Health may be required to pay a connection fee, a front footage fee, and a monthly nonuser service charge, which charge shall not be more than that proportion of the minimum monthly user charge, imposed by the authority, as debt service bears to the total operating and debt service costs, or any combination of such fees and charges. In York County and James City County, the monthly nonuser fee may be as provided by general law or not more than 85 percent of the minimum monthly user charge imposed by the authority, whichever is greater.\n\nC. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, those persons having a private septic system or domestic sewage system meeting applicable standards established by the Virginia Department of Health shall not be required under this chapter to discontinue the use of such system.

Roads, bridges, parking facilities, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, traffic signals, storm water management and retention systems, gas and electric lines and street lights within or serving the district which meet or exceed the specifications of the locality in which the roads are located.\n\nb. Parks and facilities for indoor and outdoor recreational, cultural and educational uses; entrance areas; security facilities; fencing and landscaping improvements throughout the district.\n\nc.

Issue revenue bonds of the development authority as provided in § 15.2-5125, including but not limited to refunding bonds, subject to such limitation in amount, and terms and conditions regarding capitalized interest, reserve funds, contingent funds, and investment restrictions, as may be established in the ordinance or resolution establishing the district, for all costs associated with the improvements enumerated in subdivision 1 of this subsection. Such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from revenues received by the development authority. The revenue bonds issued by a development authority shall not require the consent of the locality, except where consent is specifically required by the provisions of the resolution authorizing the collection of revenues and/or the trust agreement securing the same, and shall not be deemed to constitute a debt, liability, or obligation of any other political subdivision, and shall not impact upon the debt capacity of any other political subdivision.\n\n3. Request annually that the locality levy and collect a special tax on taxable real property within the development authority's jurisdiction to finance the services and facilities provided by the authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 (§ 58.1-3229 et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1, any such special tax imposed by the locality shall be levied upon the assessed fair market value of the taxable real property. Unless requested by every property owner within the proposed district, the rate of the special tax shall not be more than $.25 per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by § 58.1-3203. The proceeds of the special taxes collected shall be kept in a separate account and be used only for the purposes provided in this chapter. All revenues received by the locality from such special tax shall be paid over to the development authority for its use pursuant to this chapter subject to annual appropriation. No other funds of the locality shall be loaned or paid to the development authority without the prior approval of the local governing body.\n\n4. Provide special services, including: garbage and trash removal and disposal, street cleaning, snow removal, extra security personnel and equipment, recreational management and supervision, and grounds keeping.\n\n5. Finance the services and facilities it provides to abutting property within the district by special assessment thereon imposed by the local governing body. All assessments pursuant to this section shall be subject to the laws pertaining to assessments under Article 2 (§ 15.2-2404 et seq.) of Chapter 24; provided that any other provision of law notwithstanding, (i) the taxes or assessments shall not exceed the full cost of the improvements, including without limitation the legal, financial and other directly attributable costs of creating the district and the planning, designing, operating and financing of the improvements which include administration of the collection and payment of the assessments and reserve funds permitted by applicable law; (ii) the taxes or assessments may be imposed upon abutting land which is later subdivided in accordance with the terms of the ordinance forming the district, in amounts which do not exceed the peculiar benefits of the improvements to the abutting land as subdivided; and (iii) the taxes or assessments may be made subject to installment payments for up to 40 years in an amount calculated to cover principal, interest and administrative costs in connection with any financing by the authority, without a penalty for prepayment. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any assessments made pursuant to this section may be made effective as a lien upon a specified date, by ordinance, but such assessments may not thereafter be modified in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the debt instruments financing the improvements. All assessments pursuant to this section may also be made subject to installment payments and other provisions allowed for local assessments under this section or under Article 2 of Chapter 24. All revenues received by the locality pursuant to any such special assessments which the locality elects to impose upon request of the development authority shall be paid over to the development authority for its use under this chapter, subject to annual appropriation, and may be used for no other purposes.\n\n6. Fix, charge, and collect rates, fees, and charges for the use of, or the benefit derived from, the services and/or facilities provided, owned, operated, or financed by the authority benefiting property within the district. Such rates, fees, and charges may be charged to and collected by such persons and in such manner as the authority may determine from (i) any person contracting for the services or using the facilities and/or (ii) the owners, tenants, or customers of the real estate and improvements that are served by, or benefit from the use of, any such services or facilities, in such manner as shall be authorized by the authority in connection with the provision of such services or facilities.\n\n7. Purchase development rights that will be dedicated as easements for conservation, open space or other purposes pursuant to the Open-Space Land Act (§ 10.1-1700 et seq.). For purposes of this subdivision, \"development rights\" means the level and quantity of development permitted by the zoning ordinance expressed in terms of housing units per acre, floor area ratio or equivalent local measure. An authority shall not use the power of condemnation to acquire development rights.\n\n8. Subject to any statutory or regulatory jurisdiction and permitting authority of all applicable governmental bodies and agencies having authority with respect to any area included therein, finance and fund the acquisition of land within the district. All financing authority and methods provided by subsections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 shall be permitted for the acquisition of land as provided herein.\n\n9. Any special tax levied pursuant to subdivision 3 and any special assessment imposed pursuant to subdivision 5, whether previously or hereafter levied or imposed, constitute a lien on real estate ranking on parity with real estate taxes, and any such delinquent special tax or delinquent special assessment may be collected in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 4 (§ 58.1-3965 et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1, provided that the enforcement of the lien for any special assessment under subdivision 5 made subject to installment payments shall be limited to the installment payments due or past due at the time the lien is enforced through sale in accordance with Article 4 (§ 58.1-3965 et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1, and any sale to enforce payment of any delinquent taxes, assessments, or other levies shall not extinguish installment payments that are not yet due.\n\nB.
