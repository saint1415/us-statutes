      "text": "If any of the governing bodies of the Counties of Accomack and Northampton by resolution declare that there is a need for a public access authority to be created and an operating agreement is developed for the purpose of establishing or operating a public access authority for any such participating political subdivisions and that they should unite in the formation of an authority to be known as the Eastern Shore Water Access Authority (the Authority), which shall thereupon exist for such participating counties and shall exercise its powers and functions as prescribed herein. The region for which such Authority shall exist shall be coterminous with the boundaries of the participating political subdivisions. The Authority shall be charged with the following duties:\n\n1. Identify land, either owned by the Commonwealth or private holdings, that can be secured for use by the general public as a public access site;\n\n2. Research and determine ownership of all identified sites;\n\n3. Determine appropriate public use levels of identified access sites;\n\n4. Develop appropriate mechanisms for transferring title of Commonwealth or private holdings to the Authority;\n\n5. Develop appropriate acquisition and site management plans for public access usage;\n\n6. Determine which holdings should be sold to advance the mission of the Authority;\n\n7. Receive and expend public funds and private donations in order to restore or create tidal wetlands within the region for which the Authority exists, provided that any tidal mitigation credits resulting from such restoration or creation projects shall be held by the Authority for the benefit and use of participating political subdivisions and shall not be sold or conveyed to any private party by the Authority or any participating political subdivision;\n\n8. Receive and expend public funds and private donations for dredging or construction; apply for permits in order to perform dredging projects on waterways or to construct facilities and infrastructure within the region for which the Authority exists, provided that such projects enhance recreational and commercial public access; and perform such dredging projects or construct such facilities and infrastructure;\n\n9. In conjunction with one or both of the Middle Peninsula Chesapeake Bay Public Access Authority (the MPCBPAA), created pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 66 (§ 15.2-6600 et seq.), and the Northern Neck Chesapeake Bay Public Access Authority (the NNCBPAA), created pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 66.1 (§ 15.2-6626 et seq.), receive and expend public funds and private donations for dredging, apply for permits in order to perform dredging projects, and perform such dredging projects on waterways within the region for which any or all of the Authority, the MPCBPAA, or the NNCBPAA exists; and\n\n10. Perform other duties required to fulfill the mission of the Authority.\n\nIn any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the Authority, the Authority shall be deemed to have been created as a body corporate and to have been established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution as aforesaid by the participating political subdivisions declaring that there is a need for such Authority. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerks of the counties by which it is adopted shall be admissible as evidence in any suit, action, or proceeding. Any political subdivision of the Commonwealth is authorized to join such Authority pursuant to the terms and conditions of this act.\n\nThe ownership and operation by the Authority of any public access sites and related facilities and the exercise of powers conferred by this act are proper and essential governmental functions and public purposes and matters of public necessity for which public moneys may be spent and private property acquired. The Authority is a regional entity of government by or on behalf of which debt may be contracted by or on behalf of any county pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 (a) of the Constitution of Virginia.\n\n2014, c. 471; 2018, c. 327.",

      "text": "The Authority shall have the power to issue bonds from time to time in its discretion, for any of its purposes, including the payment of all or any part of the cost of Authority facilities and including the payment or retirement of bonds previously issued by it. The Authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) bonds payable, both as to principal and interest, (i) from its revenues and receipts generally and (ii) exclusively from the revenues and receipts of certain designated facilities or loans whether or not they are financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contribution from a participating political subdivision; the Commonwealth or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof; any federal agency; or any unit, private corporation, co-partnership, association, or individual, as such participating political subdivision, or other entities, may be authorized to make under general law or by pledge of any income or revenues of the Authority or by mortgage or encumbrance of any property or facilities of the Authority. Unless otherwise provided in the proceeding authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture securing the same, all bonds shall be payable solely and exclusively from the revenues and receipts of a particular facility or loan. Bonds may be executed and delivered by the Authority at any time and from time to time may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without the Commonwealth, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be payable at such time or times and at such places, may be evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided and specified by the board of directors in authorizing each particular bond issue.\n\nIf deemed advisable by the board of directors, there may be retained in the proceedings under which any bonds of the Authority are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings and as may be briefly recited on the face of the bonds, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the Authority any right or option to redeem any bonds except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any bonds of the Authority may be sold at public or private sale in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the board of directors of the Authority to be most advantageous, and the Authority may pay all costs, premiums, and commissions that its board of directors may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by the Authority of one or more series of bonds for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same facility or any other facility, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Any bonds of the Authority at any time outstanding may from time to time be refunded by the Authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the board of directors may deem necessary, but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any costs, premiums, or commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby, with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same facilities or separate facilities, and regardless of whether or not the bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or on different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.\n\nAll bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the corporate seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the secretary (or the secretary-treasurer) or the assistant secretary (or assistant secretary-treasurer) of the Authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of said chairman. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature, or such facsimile, shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. When the signatures of both the chairman or the vice-chairman and the secretary (or the secretary-treasurer) or the assistant secretary (or the assistant secretary-treasurer) are facsimiles, the bonds must be authenticated by a corporate trustee or other authenticating agent approved by the Authority.\n\nIf the proceeds derived from a particular bond issue, due to error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the Authority facilities for which such bonds were issued, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds of such issue or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds of the first issue. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus may be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additions, improvements, or enlargements of the Authority facilities for which such bonds shall have been issued.\n\nPrior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that become mutilated or are destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this act without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are specifically required by this act, provided, however, that nothing contained in this act shall be construed as affecting the powers and duties now conferred by law upon the State Corporation Commission.\n\nAll bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of and shall be and are hereby made negotiable instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code of Virginia (§ 8.1A-101 et seq.), subject only to provisions respecting registration of the bonds.\n\nIn addition to all other powers granted to the Authority by this act, the Authority is authorized to provide for the issuance from time to time of notes or other obligations of the Authority for any of its authorized purposes. All of the provisions of this act that relate to bonds or revenue bonds shall apply to such notes or other obligations insofar as such provisions may be appropriate.\n\n2014, c. 471.",
