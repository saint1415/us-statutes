However, with regard to Planning Districts 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, the governing bodies of any two or more localities within the region, provided that one or more of the localities is a city or county, may adopt such an ordinance. Such ordinances shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Upon certification by the Secretary of the Commonwealth that the ordinances required by this chapter have been filed and, upon the basis of the facts set forth therein, satisfy such requirements, the proposed authority shall be and constitute an authority for all of the purposes of this chapter, to be known and designated by the name stated in the ordinances. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the authority shall be deemed to have been lawfully and properly created and established and authorized to exercise its powers under this chapter. Each authority created pursuant to this chapter is hereby created as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. At any time subsequent to the creation of an authority under this chapter, the membership of the authority may, with the approval of the authority's board, be expanded to include any locality within the region that would have been eligible to be an initial member of the authority. The governing body of a locality seeking to become a member of an existing authority shall evidence its intent to become a member by adopting an ordinance proposing to join the authority that conforms, to the extent applicable, to the requirements for an ordinance set forth in clauses (i), (iii), and (iv).\n\n1997, cc. 276, 587, § 15.1-1712; 1999, cc. 820, 882; 2000, c. 892; 2001, c. 391; 2002, c. 691; 2006, c. 324; 2018, c. 545; 2024, c. 167.",

      "text": "A. All powers, rights and duties conferred by this chapter, or other provisions of law, upon an authority shall be exercised by a board of directors. A board shall consist of two members for each member locality. The governing body of each member locality shall appoint two members to the board. Any person who is a resident of the Commonwealth may be appointed to the board. However, if an authority has only two member localities, the governing body of each locality may appoint three members each. However, in any instance in which the member localities are not equally contributing funding to the authority, and upon agreement by each member locality, the number of appointments to be made by each locality may be based upon the percentage of local funds contributed by each of the member localities. Each member of a board shall serve for a term of four years and may be reappointed for as many terms as the governing body desires. However, the board may elect to provide for staggered terms, in which case some members may draw an initial two-year term. If a vacancy occurs by reason of the death, disqualification or resignation of a board member, the governing body of the member locality that appointed the authority board member shall appoint a successor to fill the unexpired term.\n\nHowever, with regard to any authority created by Planning Districts 10, 11, and 12, only members of the appointing governing body of each member locality shall be appointed to the board. In the event such board members feel it is necessary to have an odd number of members, they may establish a rotation system that will allow one locality to appoint one extra member to serve for up to two years. Each locality will, in turn, appoint such extra member. Once the cycle is completed, the rotation shall be repeated.\n\nEach member locality may appoint up to two alternate board members. Alternates shall be selected in the same manner as board members, and may serve as an alternate for either board member from the member locality that appoints the alternate. Alternates shall be appointed for terms that coincide with one or more of the board members from the member locality that appoints the alternate. If a board member is not present at a meeting of the authority, the alternate shall have all the voting and other rights of the board member not present and shall be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. Alternates are required to take an oath of office and are entitled to reimbursement for expenses in the same manner as board members.\n\nB. Each member of a board shall, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of his office, take and subscribe to the oath prescribed in § 49-1. Members shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties from funds available to the authority.\n\nC. A quorum shall exist when a majority of the member localities are represented by at least one member of the board. The affirmative vote of a quorum of the board shall be necessary for any action taken by the board. No vacancy in the membership of a board shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the board. The board shall determine the times and places of its regular meetings, which may be adjourned or continued, without further public notice, from day to day or from time to time or from place to place, but not beyond the time fixed for the next regular meeting, until the business before the board is completed. Special meetings of a board shall be held when requested by members of the board representing two or more localities. Any such request for a special meeting shall be in writing, and the request shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be considered at the meeting. A reasonable effort shall be made to provide each member with notice of any special meeting. No matter not specified in the notice shall be considered at such special meeting unless all the members of the board are present. Special meetings may be adjourned or continued, without further public notice, from day to day or from time to time or from place to place, not beyond the time fixed for the next regular meeting, until the business before the board is completed.\n\nD. Each board shall elect from its membership a chairman for each calendar year. The board may also appoint an executive director and staff who shall discharge such functions as may be directed by the board. The executive director and staff shall be paid from funds received by the authority.\n\nE. Each board, promptly following the close of the fiscal year, shall submit an annual report of the authority's activities of the preceding year to the governing body of each member locality. Each such report shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering the operation of the authority during such year.\n\n1997, cc. 276, 587, § 15.1-1713; 1999, cc. 820, 882; 2000, c. 892; 2001, cc. 7, 15, 390, 391; 2002, c. 691; 2006, c. 758; 2014, c. 728.",

For a period of thirty days after the date of the filing with the circuit court having jurisdiction over any of the political subdivisions that are members of the authority and in which the facility or any portion thereof being financed is located a certified copy of the initial resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of bonds, any person in interest may contest the validity of the bonds, the rates, rents, fees and other charges for the services and facilities furnished by, for the use of, or in connection with, the facility or any portion thereof being financed, the pledge of revenues pledged to payment of the bonds, any provisions that may be recited in any resolution, trust agreement, indenture or other instrument authorizing the issuance of bonds, or any matter contained in, provided for or done or to be done pursuant to the foregoing. If such contest is not given within the thirty-day period, the authority to issue bonds, the validity of any other provision contained in the resolution, trust agreement, indenture or other instrument, and all proceedings in connection with the authorization and the issuance of the bonds shall be conclusively presumed to have been legally taken and no court shall have authority to inquire into such matters and no such contest shall thereafter be instituted.\n\nUpon the delivery of any bonds reciting that they are issued pursuant to this chapter and a resolution or resolutions adopted under this chapter, the bonds shall be conclusively presumed to be fully authorized by all the laws of the Commonwealth and to have been sold, executed and delivered by the authority in conformity with such laws, and the validity of the bonds shall not be questioned by a party plaintiff, a party defendant, the authority, or any other interested party in any court, anything in this chapter or in any other statutes to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n1997, cc. 276, 587, § 15.1-1719; 2002, c. 691.",

No member seeking withdrawal shall retain, without the consent of a majority of the remaining members, any rights to contributions made by such member, to any property held by such authority or to any revenue sharing as allowed by §§ 15.2-6406 and 15.2-6407. Upon withdrawal, the withdrawing member shall also return to the authority any dues or other contributions refunded to such member during its membership in the authority. Whenever the board determines that the purpose for which the authority was created has been substantially fulfilled or is impractical or impossible to accomplish and that all obligations incurred by the authority have been paid or that cash or a sufficient amount of United States government securities has been deposited for their payment, or provisions satisfactory for the timely payment of all its outstanding obligations have been arranged, the board may adopt resolutions declaring and finding that the authority shall be dissolved. Appropriate attested copies of such resolutions shall be delivered to the Governor so that legislation dissolving such authority may be introduced in the General Assembly. The dissolution of an authority shall become effective according to the terms of such legislation. The title to all funds and other property owned by such authority at the time of such dissolution shall vest in the member localities which have contributed to the authority in proportion to their respective contributions.\n\n1997, cc. 276, 587, § 15.1-1725; 2010, c. 531.",
