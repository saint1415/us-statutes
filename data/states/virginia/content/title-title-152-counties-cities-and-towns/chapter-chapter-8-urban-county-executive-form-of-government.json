At such election their successors shall be elected for terms of four years each.\n\nIf the number of districts in any such county is increased by redistricting or otherwise subsequent to a general election for supervisors, and such supervisors have taken office, then the board shall adopt a resolution requesting a judge of the circuit court for such county to call a special election for an additional supervisor or supervisors in accordance with the increase in the number of districts, such additional supervisor or supervisors to be elected from the county at large, and such election shall be held within 45 days from the date of such request. The qualifications of candidates and the election shall be as at general law applying to special elections.

A bachelor of science degree in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture or related science or equivalent experience or a land surveyor certified pursuant to § 54.1-408.\n\n2. Successful completion of an educational program specified by the county.\n\n3. A minimum of two years of land development engineering design experience acceptable to the county.\n\n4. Attendance at continuing educational courses specified by the county.\n\n5. Consistent preparation and submission of plans which meet all applicable ordinances and regulations.\n\nC. If an expedited review procedure is adopted by the board of supervisors pursuant to this section, the board of supervisors shall establish an advisory plans examiner board which shall make recommendations to the board of supervisors on the general operation of the program, on the general qualifications of those who may participate in the expedited processing procedure, on initial and continuing educational programs needed to qualify and maintain qualification for such a program, and on the general administration and operation of such a program. In addition, the plans examiner board shall submit recommendations to the board of supervisors as to those persons who meet the established qualifications for participation in the program and as to whether those persons who have previously qualified to participate in the program should be disqualified, suspended or otherwise disciplined. The plans examiner board shall consist of six members who shall be appointed by the board of supervisors for staggered four-year terms. Initial terms may be less than four years so as to provide for staggered terms. The plans examiner board shall consist of three persons in private practice as licensed professional engineers or land surveyors certified pursuant to § 54.1-408, at least one of whom shall be a certified land surveyor; one person employed by the county government; one person employed by the Virginia Department of Transportation who shall serve as a nonvoting advisory member; and one citizen member. All plans examiner board members who serve as licensed engineers or as certified surveyors must maintain their professional license or certification as a condition of holding office, and all such persons shall have at least two years of experience in land development procedures of the county. The citizen member shall meet the qualifications provided in § 54.1-107.

The expedited land development program shall include an educational program conducted under the auspices of a public institution of higher education. The instructors in the educational program shall consist of persons in the private and public sectors who are qualified to prepare land development plans. The educational program shall include the comprehensive and detailed study of county ordinances and regulations relating to plans and how they are applied.\n\nE. The separate processing system may include a review of selected or random aspects of plans rather than a detailed review of all aspects. However, it shall also include periodic detailed review of plans prepared by persons who qualify for the system.\n\nF. In no event shall this section relieve persons who prepare and submit plans of the responsibilities and obligations which they would otherwise have with regard to the preparation of plans, nor shall it relieve the county of its obligation to review other plans in the time periods and manner prescribed by law.\n\n1989, c. 735, § 15.1-783.01; 1990, c. 822; 1997, c. 587; 2009, c. 309.",

If the owner or developer has not met all previous land development obligations in accordance with all development agreements with the locality as determined by the governing body or its designated administrative agency for the previous seven years, then a personal, corporate, or property bond may be disallowed by the governing body as security for such facilities, and in such event, security for such facilities shall be restricted to a certified check, cash escrow, or a letter of credit that meets the requirements of clause (iv) herein. The amount of such certified check, cash escrow, bond, or letter of credit shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost of construction based on current unit prices for new public or private sector construction in the locality and a reasonable allowance for estimated administrative costs, inflation, and potential damage to existing roads or utilities, which shall not exceed 25% of the estimated construction costs. However, if for the previous seven years the owner or developer has not met all previous land development obligations in accordance with all development agreements with the locality as determined by the governing body or its designated administrative agency, the governing body may require that the allowance for estimated administrative costs, inflation, and potential damage to existing roads or utilities be greater than 25% of the estimated construction costs, but not to exceed 50% of the estimated construction costs. \"Developer,\" as used in this section, means any owner, builder, subdivider or other person or entity engaged in the land development process and shall include their principals, officers, members, managers, partners, alter egos, and members of the immediate family related to any of the foregoing. \"Such facilities,\" as used in this section, means those facilities specifically provided for in this section.\n\nB. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection E of § 15.2-2245, a subdivision ordinance may provide that upon written request by the subdivider or developer, the governing body or its designated administrative agency shall be required to make periodic partial releases of such bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee in a cumulative amount equal to no less than 90% of the original amount for which the bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee was taken, and may make partial releases to such lower amounts as may be authorized by the governing body or its designated administrative agency based upon the percentage of public facilities completed and approved by the governing body, local administrative agency, or state agency having jurisdiction. If the subdivider or developer has not met all previous land development obligations in accordance with all development agreements with the locality as determined by the governing body or its designated administrative agency for the previous seven years prior to the written request for partial release, the cumulative amount released may be equal to no less than 80% of the original amount for which the bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee was taken. \"Subdivider\" and \"developer,\" as used in this section, mean any owner, builder, subdivider, or other person or entity engaged in the land development process and shall include their principals, officers, members, managers, partners, alter egos, and members of the immediate family related to any of the foregoing. Periodic partial releases may not occur before the completion of at least 30% of the public facilities covered by any bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee. The governing body or administrative agency shall not be required to execute more than three periodic partial releases in any 12-month period. Upon final completion and acceptance of the public facilities, the governing body or administrative agency shall release any remaining bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee to the subdivider or developer. For the purpose of final release, the term \"acceptance\" means when the public facility is accepted by and taken over for operation and maintenance by the state agency, local government department or agency, or other public authority which is responsible for maintaining and operating such public facility upon acceptance.\n\n2006, c. 736.",
