If such money is paid and possession taken within 90 days of the time of the filing of the report of the body determining just compensation, no interest on the amount of the award, or any part thereof, shall be allowable to the defendant or defendants, and if such money is paid and possession taken after the lapse of more than 90 days from the date of the filing of the report of the body determining just compensation, the court, upon hearing after due notice, shall adjudicate all claims made by the defendant or defendants for damages claimed to have been sustained and for interest on the value of the property taken, and for additions thereto or replacements during or for the time elapsed since the expiration of the 90 days. If the property taken, or any part thereof, be income producing the court shall take into consideration any income accruing to the property owner during such period, and shall also take into consideration depreciation of an operating water system as well as the cost of additions, betterments, and replacements made by the city or county. If the court finds that the property owner is entitled to receive any additional payment by reason of such matters, it shall render judgment against the city or county for the amount thereof.\n\n1938, p. 50; Michie Code 1942, § 4387a; Code 1950, § 25-55; 2003, c. 940.",
