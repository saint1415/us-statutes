The proper development of such areas industrially and otherwise is required so that local governments may derive revenues with which to render necessary services to their citizens and so that industrial development; job creation; and housing, recreational, commercial, educational and other economic and social development may be fostered and stimulated to prevent the creation of blighted areas in the Commonwealth with resultant injury to all.
