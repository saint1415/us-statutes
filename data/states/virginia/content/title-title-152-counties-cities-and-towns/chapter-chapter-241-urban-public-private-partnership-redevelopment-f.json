The Fund shall consist of sums appropriated to the Fund by the General Assembly; sums which may be allocated to the Commonwealth for this purpose by the United States government; all interest earned on moneys in the Fund; and any other sums designated for deposit to the Fund from any source, public or private. The Fund is created to address the serious problem of a lack of developable land in urban areas of the Commonwealth and the high cost of redeveloping such land. The Fund shall make grants or loans to local governments for assembling, planning, clearing, and remediating sites for the purpose of promoting such sites to private developers for redevelopment.\n\nThe Fund shall be administered and managed by the Department as prescribed in this chapter. The Department may disburse from the Fund reasonable costs and expenses incurred in administration and management of the Fund.\n\n2000, c. 757.",
