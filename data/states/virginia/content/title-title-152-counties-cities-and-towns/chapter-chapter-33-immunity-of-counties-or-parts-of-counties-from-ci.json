If the court determines that the county or tier-city has not met the criteria for immunity as set forth in this section, it shall deny the county's or tier-city's petition.\n\nC. In the determination of its population density, a county or tier-city may elect to have excluded from consideration the area of property within its boundaries which is owned by the federal and state governments and the area covered by bodies of water of forty acres or more in size. If a county or tier-city elects to exclude such areas from consideration, any county or tier-city residents residing in such areas must also be excluded in determining the county's or tier-city's population and population density.\n\n1979, c. 85, § 15.1-977.21; 1984, c. 695; 1997, c. 587.",

      "text": "The governing body of any county which feels appropriate urban-type services are being provided, exclusive of those services which are provided by a city but inclusive of those services provided by cooperative agreement between the county and city, in the part of the county proposed for immunity may, by ordinance passed by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the members thereof, petition the circuit court for the county for an order declaring some part or parts of the county immune from city-initiated annexation and from incorporation of new cities within such part or parts. The ordinance passed by the governing body of the county shall designate the area or areas for which the county desires such partial immunity. The circuit court with which the petition is filed shall notify the Supreme Court, which shall appoint a special court to hear the case as prescribed by Chapter 30 (§ 15.2-3000 et seq.) of this title.\n\nIn considering the petition, the special court shall use the list of services set out in subdivision 1 of § 15.2-3209 as a guide in determining whether appropriate urban-type services are being provided in such part or parts of the county. The court shall also consider (i) whether the county has made efforts to comply with applicable state policies with respect to environmental protection, public planning, education, public transportation, housing, and other state service policies promulgated by the General Assembly; (ii) whether a community of interest exists between that part of the county for which immunity is sought and the remainder of the county that is greater than the community of interest that exists between that part of the county for which the immunity is sought and the adjoining municipality; and (iii) whether either party has arbitrarily refused to cooperate in the joint provision of services. Unless the population of a city adjoining a county which is seeking partial immunity exceeds 100,000 persons, the court shall not grant partial immunity to such county which would result in substantially foreclosing such a city from expanding its boundaries by annexation. The court may include a greater or smaller area than the area for which immunity is sought.\n\nAny city or town adjoining or within the county, or the parts proposed for immunity, shall be made parties to the action. The finding of the Commission on Local Government shall be received into evidence, and the court shall receive such additional evidence as the parties may introduce. The court may limit additional evidence to those kinds of services considered by the Commission. If, after consideration of the evidence, the court finds that the county has appropriate urban-type services, comparable to the type and level of services furnished in the city from which the county seeks immunity, within such parts of the county that are proposed for immunity and that the other conditions in this section are satisfied, the court shall enter an order declaring such part or parts of the county to be immune from city-initiated annexation and incorporation of new cities.\n\n1979, c. 85, § 15.1-977.22:1; 1983, c. 217; 1997, c. 587.",

Immunity granted by this chapter shall not be interpreted to prohibit any town annexations, or to prohibit annexations to a city initiated under the provisions of § 15.2-3203, except that no city may commence or be a petitioner in any such proceeding.\n\nB. Notwithstanding other provisions of law, including § 15.2-3800, no grant of county immunity shall be interpreted to deny the right of any town, which in 1979 possessed a population in excess of 5,000 persons and was situated in a county possessing a population of 20,000 or more persons and a population density of 300 or more persons per square mile, or a population of 50,000 or more persons and a population density of 140 persons or more per square mile, based either on the United States census, on population estimates of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia, or on a special census conducted under court supervision, to obtain city status. Where a town seeks to become a city under the provisions of this section, the special court shall be limited in its review to a determination of the town's population and population density. Where the court determines that such town has a population of at least 5,000 persons and a density of 200 persons per square mile, it shall enter an order granting the town city status.\n\n1979, c. 85, § 15.1-977.23; 1997, c. 587; 2002, c. 199.",

Such election shall be exercised by notifying the Governor of the election at least two years prior to the beginning of the biennium in which it takes effect. If, after a minimum period of eight years following the date upon which such treatment has become effective, a city wishes to terminate such treatment as an immune county, it shall notify the Governor of its intention to return to being treated as a city for such purposes.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to a petition for partial immunity if the previous petition was withdrawn, or was dismissed for any reason other than the merits of the case.\n\nThe provisions of this section further shall not apply to a county which institutes an immunity proceeding by filing notice with the Commission on Local Government but subsequently fails to petition the court to grant such immunity.
