To contract and be contracted with, to sue and be sued, and to adopt, use, and alter at its pleasure a seal;\n\n2. To acquire and hold real or personal property necessary or convenient for its purposes;\n\n3.

To acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any lands, property rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements, and other property, including public lands, parks, playgrounds, reservations, highways, or parkways, or parts thereof or rights therein, of any person, partnership, association, railroad, public service, public utility, or other corporation, or of any municipality, county, or other political subdivision, deemed necessary or convenient for the construction or the efficient operation of a project or necessary in the restoration, replacement, or relocation of public or private property damaged or destroyed whenever a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon with the governing body of such municipality, county, or other political subdivision as to such property owned by it or whenever the Authority cannot agree on the terms of purchase or settlement with the other owners because of the incapacity of such owners, because of the inability to agree on the compensation to be paid or other terms of settlement or purchase, or because such owners are nonresidents of the Commonwealth, are unknown, or are unable to convey valid title to such property. Such proceedings shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of any and all laws of the Commonwealth applicable to the exercise of the power of eminent domain in the name of the Commissioner of Highways and subject to the provisions of § 25.1-102 as fully as if the Authority were a corporation possessing the power of eminent domain. Title to any property condemned by the Authority shall immediately vest in the Authority, and the Authority shall be entitled to the immediate possession of such property upon the deposit with the clerk of the court in which such condemnation proceedings are originated of the total amount of the appraised price of the property and court costs and fees as provided by law, notwithstanding that any of the parties to such proceedings shall appeal from any decision in such condemnation proceeding. Whenever the Authority makes such deposit in connection with any condemnation proceeding, the making of such deposit shall not preclude the Authority from appealing any decision rendered in such proceedings. Upon the deposit with the clerk of the court of the appraised price, any person entitled thereto may, upon petition to the court, be paid his or their pro rata share of 90 percent of such appraised price. The acceptance of such payment shall not preclude such person from appealing any decision rendered in such proceedings. If the appraisement is greater or less than the amount finally determined by the decision in such proceeding or by an appeal, the amount of the increase or decrease shall be paid by or refunded to the Authority.\n\nThe terms \"appraised price\" and \"appraisement\" as used in this subdivision mean the value determined by two competent real estate appraisers appointed by the Authority for such purposes.\n\nThe acquisition of any such property by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain shall be and is hereby declared to be a public use of such property;\n\n8.

The bonds of each issue or series shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding six percent per year, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 50 years from the date or dates thereof, as may be determined by the Authority, and may contain provisions reserving the right of the Authority to redeem such bonds before maturity at such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution authorizing such bonds. Such bonds may be issued in coupon form, registered form, or both as prescribed by the Authority, and provisions may be made for the registration of coupon bonds as to principal only or as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of registered bonds into coupon bonds. Such bonds may be issued in any denomination and may be made payable at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth as the Authority may determine. Such bonds and the coupons attached to coupon bonds shall be signed in such manner either manually or by facsimile signature, as shall be determined by the Authority, and sealed with the seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof. In case any officer whose signature or facsimile thereof shall appear on any bond or coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer or officers had remained in office until the delivery thereof. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner either at public or private sale and for such price or prices as the Authority may determine, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per year, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on the redemption of any bond prior to maturity. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond that has become mutilated, destroyed, or lost.\n\n2009, c. 471, § 15.2-7003; 2014, c. 805.",
