Members, employees, agents, and contractors of the Commission shall provide access to information necessary or desirable for the conduct of the annual audit.\n\nD. Financing.\n\n1. The Commission's operations shall be funded, independently of WMATA, by the Signatory jurisdictions and, when available, by federal funds. The Commission shall have no authority to levy taxes.\n\n2.

The Commission may borrow up to five percent of its last annual appropriations budget in anticipation of receipts, or as otherwise set forth in the appropriations budget approved by all of the Signatories, from any lawful lending institution for any purpose of this Compact, including, without limitation, for administrative expenses. Such loans shall be for a term not to exceed two years, or at such longer term approved by each Signatory pursuant to its laws as evidenced by the written authorization by the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Governors of Maryland and Virginia, and at such rates of interest as shall be acceptable to the Commission.\n\n4. With respect to the District of Columbia, the commitment or obligation to render financial assistance to the Commission shall be created, by appropriation or in such other manner, or by such other legislation, as the District of Columbia shall determine; provided, that any such commitment or obligation shall be approved by Congress pursuant to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 774; D.C.

Thus, pursuant to the Anti-Deficiency Acts, nothing in this MSC Compact creates an obligation of the District in anticipation of an appropriation for such purpose, and the District's legal liability for the payment of any amount under this MSC Compact does not and may not arise or obtain in advance of the lawful availability of appropriated funds for the applicable fiscal year.\n\nE.

Reconsideration of Commission Orders.\n\n1. WMATA shall have the right to petition the Commission for reconsideration of an order based on rules and procedures developed by the Commission.\n\n2. Consistent with subdivision C 2 of Article III, the filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not act as a stay upon the execution of a Commission order, or any part of it, unless the Commission orders otherwise. WMATA may appeal any adverse action on a petition for reconsideration as set forth in subdivision G 1.\n\nG. Judicial Matters.\n\n1. The United States District Courts for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, the United States District Courts for the District of Maryland, Southern Division, and the United States District Courts for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction of all actions brought by or against the Commission and to enforce subpoenas under this MSC Compact.\n\n2.

The Commission and its members, alternate members, officers, agents, employees, or representatives shall not be liable for suit or action or for any judgment or decree for damages, loss, or injury resulting from action taken within the scope of their employment or duties under this MSC Compact, nor required in any case arising or any appeal taken under this MSC Compact to give a supersedeas bond or security for damages. Nothing in this section shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.\n\n2. The Commission shall be liable for its contracts and for its torts and those of its members, alternate members, officers, agents, employees, and representatives committed in the conduct of any proprietary function, in accordance with the law of the applicable Signatory, including, without limitation, rules on conflict of laws but shall not be liable for any torts occurring in the performance of a governmental function. The exclusive remedy for such breach of contract or tort for which the Commission shall be liable, as herein provided, shall be by suit against the Commission. Nothing contained in this MSC Compact shall be construed as a waiver by the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, or the State of Maryland of any immunity from suit.\n\nI. Commitment of Parties.\n\nEach of the Signatories pledges to each other faithful cooperation in providing safety oversight for the WMATA Rail System, and, to affect such purposes, agrees to consider in good faith and request any necessary legislation to achieve the objectives of this MSC Compact.\n\nJ. Amendments and Supplements.\n\nAmendments and supplements to this MSC Compact shall be adopted by legislative action of each of the Signatories and the consent of Congress. When one Signatory adopts an amendment or supplement to an existing section of this MSC Compact, that amendment or supplement shall not be immediately effective, and the previously enacted provision or provisions shall remain in effect in each jurisdiction until the amendment or supplement is approved by the other Signatories and is consented to by Congress.\n\nK. Withdrawal and Termination.\n\n1. Any Signatory may withdraw from this MSC Compact, which action shall constitute a termination of this MSC Compact.\n\n2. Withdrawal from this MSC Compact shall be by a Signatory's repeal of this MSC Compact from its laws, but such repeal shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of the repealed statute and written notice of the withdrawal being given by the withdrawing Signatory to the governors or mayors, as appropriate, of the other Signatories.\n\n3. Prior to termination of this MSC Compact, the Commission shall provide to each Signatory:\n\na. A mechanism for concluding the operations of the Commission;\n\nb. A proposal to maintain state safety oversight of the WMATA Rail System in compliance with applicable federal law;\n\nc.

A plan to return any surplus funds that remain four years after the creation of the trust.\n\nL. Construction and Severability.\n\n1. This MSC Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes for which it is created.\n\n2. If any part or provision of this MSC Compact or the application thereof to any person or circumstances be adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of this MSC Compact or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances, and the Signatories hereby declare that they would have entered into this MSC Compact or the remainder thereof had the invalidity of such provision or application thereof been apparent.\n\nM. Adoption; Effective Date.\n\nThis MSC Compact shall be adopted by the Signatories in the manner provided by law therefor and shall be signed and sealed in four duplicate original copies. One such copy shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Maryland, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Secretary of the District of Columbia in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction. One copy shall be filed and retained in the archives of the Commission upon its organization. This MSC Compact shall become effective upon the enactment of concurring legislation by the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland, and consent thereto by Congress and when all other acts or actions have been taken, including, without limitation, the signing and execution of this MSC Compact by the Governors of Maryland and Virginia and the Mayor of the District of Columbia.\n\nN. Conflict of Laws.\n\n1. Any conflict between any authority granted herein, or the exercise of such authority, and the provisions of the WMATA Compact shall be resolved in favor of the exercise of such authority by the Commission.\n\n2. All other general or special laws inconsistent with this MSC Compact are hereby declared to be inapplicable to the Commission or its activities.\n\n2017, cc. 696, 705.",
