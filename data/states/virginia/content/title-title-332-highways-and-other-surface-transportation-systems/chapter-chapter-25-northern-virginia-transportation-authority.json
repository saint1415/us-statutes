The Authority shall prepare a regional transportation plan for Planning District 8 that includes transportation improvements of regional significance and those improvements necessary or incidental thereto and shall revise and amend the plan. The provisions of Article 7 (§ 33.2-1928 et seq.) of Chapter 19 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to preparation of such transportation plan.\n\n2. The Authority shall evaluate all significant transportation projects, including highway, mass transit, and technology projects, in and near Planning District 8, to the extent that funds are available for such purpose. The evaluation shall provide an objective, quantitative rating for each project according to the degree to which the project is expected to reduce congestion and, to the extent feasible, the degree to which the project is expected to improve regional mobility in the event of a homeland security emergency. Such evaluation shall rely on analytical techniques and transportation modeling, including those that employ computer simulations currently and customarily employed in transportation planning. The Authority may rely on the results of transportation modeling performed by other entities, including the Department of Transportation and private entities contracted for this purpose, provided that such modeling is in accordance with this section. The Authority shall publicize the quantitative ratings determined for each project on its website and complete the evaluation at least once every four years, with interim progress reports provided on the website at least once every six months.\n\nFor purposes of this section, the significant transportation projects to be evaluated may include:\n\na. Projects included in the version of the Financially Constrained Long-Range Transportation Plan of the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board in effect when the evaluation is made, plus additional projects in the plan adopted according to subdivision 1; and\n\nb. Other highway, rail, bus, and technology projects that could make a significant impact on mobility in the region, including additional Potomac River crossings west and south of Washington, D.C.; extension of the Metro Orange Line, Metro Yellow Line, and Metro Blue Line; bus rapid transit on Interstate 66; vehicle capacity and mass transit improvements on the U.S. Route 1 corridor; and implementation of relevant portions of the Statewide Transportation Plan established pursuant to § 33.2-353.\n\n3. The Authority may, when a transportation plan is adopted according to subdivision 1, construct or acquire, by purchase, lease, contract, or otherwise, the transportation facilities specified in such transportation plan.\n\n4. The Authority may enter into agreements or leases with public or private entities for the operation of its facilities or may operate such facilities itself.\n\n5. The Authority may enter into contracts or agreements with the counties and cities embraced by the Authority, with other transportation commissions of transportation districts adjoining any county or city embraced by the Authority, with any transportation authority, or with any federal, state, local, or private entity to provide, or cause to be provided, transportation facilities and services to the area embraced by the Authority. Such contracts or agreements, together with any agreements or leases for the operation of such facilities, may be used by the Authority to finance the construction and operation of transportation facilities and such contracts, agreements, or leases shall inure to the benefit of any creditor of the Authority.\n\nNotwithstanding subdivisions 1 through 5, the Authority shall not have the power to regulate services provided by taxicabs, either within municipalities or across municipal boundaries; such regulation is expressly reserved to the municipalities within which taxicabs operate.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Authority may:\n\na. Acquire land or any interest therein by purchase, lease, or gift and provide transportation facilities thereon for use in connection with any transportation service;\n\nb. Acquire land or any interest therein by purchase, lease, or gift in advance of the need for sale or contribution to an agency, for use by that agency in connection with an adopted transportation plan; and\n\nc. Prepare a plan for mass transportation services with persons, counties, cities, agencies, authorities, or transportation commissions and may further contract with any such person or entity to provide necessary facilities, equipment, operations and maintenance, access, and insurance pursuant to such plan.\n\n2002, c. 846, § 15.2-4830; 2014, c. 805; 2019, c. 749.",

All revenues dedicated to the Fund pursuant to §§ 33.2-2400, 58.1-638, and 58.1-802.4, any other funds that may be appropriated by the General Assembly, and any funds that may be received for the credit of the Fund from any other source shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund.

Of the revenues distributed pursuant to this subsection, as determined solely by the applicable locality, such revenues shall be used for additional urban or secondary highway construction, for other capital improvements that reduce congestion, for other transportation capital improvements that have been approved by the most recent long-range transportation plan adopted by the Authority, or for public transportation purposes. None of the revenue distributed by this subsection may be used to repay debt issued before July 1, 2013.

The amount of any such reduction in revenue shall be redistributed according to subsection C. The provisions of this subdivision shall be ongoing and apply over annual periods as determined by the Authority.\n\nC. 1. The remaining 70 percent of the revenues received by the Authority under subsection A, plus the amount of any revenue to be redistributed pursuant to subsection B, shall be used by the Authority solely to fund transportation projects selected by the Authority that are contained in the regional transportation plan in accordance with subdivision 1 of § 33.2-2500 and that have been rated in accordance with subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500.

Such projects selected by the Authority for funding shall be located (i) only in localities embraced by the Authority or (ii) in adjacent localities but only to the extent that such extension is an insubstantial part of the project and is essential to the viability of the project within the localities embraced by the Authority.\n\n2. Not less than 15 days prior to any decision by the Authority for the expenditure of funds pursuant to subdivision 1 for any project to create or improve any transportation facility, the Authority shall make the following publicly available: (i) the project evaluation pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500, (ii) the total amount of funds from the Authority to be used for the project, (iii) the total amount of funds from sources other than the Authority to be used for the project, and (iv) any other rating or scoring of other factors to be taken into account by the Authority related to each such transportation facility.\n\n3.

The Authority is independent of any state or local entity, including the Department and the Commonwealth Transportation Board, but the Authority, the Department, and the Commonwealth Transportation Board shall consult with one another to avoid duplication of efforts and, at the option of the Authority, may combine efforts to complete specific projects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of the Authority, the Department may provide the Authority with engineering services or right-of-way acquisition for the project with its own forces.\n\n4. With regard to the revenues distributed under subdivision 1, each locality's total long-term benefit shall be approximately equal to the proportion of the total of the fees and taxes received by the Authority that are generated by or attributable to the locality divided by the total of such fees and taxes received by the Authority.\n\nD.
