Any appointment to fill a vacancy shall be for the unexpired term.\n\nC. Each member may appoint up to two alternate representatives of the board. Alternates shall be selected in the same manner as regular representatives and may serve as an alternate for any board representative appointed by the member. Alternates shall be appointed for terms that coincide with one or more of the regular representatives appointed by the member.

Each member of the board before entering upon the discharge of the duties of his office shall take and subscribe to the oath prescribed in § 49-1.\n\nE. Representatives of the board shall serve without compensation but shall be eligible for reimbursement of actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties from funds available to the authority.\n\nF. A quorum shall exist when a majority of the members of the authority are represented by at least one representative of the board. The affirmative vote of a quorum of the board shall be necessary for any action taken by the board. No vacancy in the membership of the board shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the board.\n\nG. The board shall determine the times and places of its regular meetings, which may be adjourned or continued, without further public notice. Special meetings of the board shall be held when requested by representatives of the board representing two or more members. Any such request for a special meeting shall be in writing, and the request shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be considered at the meeting. An effort shall be made to provide members reasonable notice of any special meeting. No matter not specified in the notice shall be considered at such special meeting unless all of the representatives of the board are present. Special meetings may be adjourned or continued without further public notice.\n\nH. The board shall annually elect from its membership a chairman. The board may also appoint an executive director and staff to discharge such functions as may be directed by the board. The executive director and staff shall be paid from funds received by the authority.\n\nI. At the close of each fiscal year, the board shall submit to each governing body an annual report of the authority's activities of the preceding year. Such report shall include a complete operating and financial statement covering the operation of the authority during the preceding year.\n\n2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 353, 354.",

The revenues pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding against any person having any claim of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether the person has notice. No resolution, trust agreement or financing statement, continuation statement, or other instrument adopted or entered into by the authority need be filed or recorded in any public record other than the records of the authority in order to perfect the lien against third persons, regardless of any contrary provision of public general or local law.\n\nH. Except to the extent restricted by an applicable resolution or trust agreement, any holder of bonds issued under this chapter or a trustee acting under a trust agreement entered into under this chapter, may, by any suitable form of legal proceedings, protect and enforce any rights granted under the laws of Virginia or by any applicable resolution or trust agreement.\n\nI. The authority may issue bonds to refund any of its bonds then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of the bonds. Refunding bonds may be issued for the public purposes of realizing savings in the effective costs of debt service, directly or through a debt restructuring, for alleviating impending or actual default and may be issued in one or more series in an amount in excess of that of the bonds to be refunded.\n\nJ. For a period of 30 days after the date of the filing with the circuit court having jurisdiction over any of the political subdivisions that are members of the authority and in which the facility or any portion thereof being financed is located a certified copy of the initial resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of bonds, any person in interest may contest the validity of the bonds, rates, rents, fees, and other charges for the services and facilities furnished by, for the use of, or in connection with, the facility or any portion thereof being financed, the pledge of revenues pledged to payment of the bonds, any provisions that may be recited in any resolution, trust agreement, indenture or other instrument authorizing the issuance of bonds, or any matter contained in, provided for, or done or to be done pursuant to the foregoing. If such contest is not given within the 30-day period, the authority to issue bonds, the validity of any other provision contained in the resolution, trust agreement, indenture, or other instrument, and all proceedings in connection with the authorization and the issuance of the bonds, shall be conclusively presumed to have been legally taken, and no court shall have authority to inquire into such matters and no such contest shall thereafter be instituted.\n\nK. Upon the delivery of any bonds reciting that they are issued pursuant to this chapter and a resolution or resolutions adopted under this chapter, the bonds shall be conclusively presumed to be fully authorized by all of the laws of the Commonwealth and to have been sold, executed, and delivered by the authority in conformity with such laws, and the validity of the bonds shall not be questioned by a party plaintiff, a party defendant, the authority, or any other interested party in any court, anything in this chapter or in any other statutes to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n2021, Sp.
