However, such prohibition shall not apply to (i) reconstruction with additional lanes of a highway, bridge, or tunnel provided that the number of un-tolled non-high-occupancy vehicle lanes, excluding auxiliary lanes, after the reconstruction is not less than the number of un-tolled, non-high-occupancy vehicle lanes, excluding auxiliary lanes, prior to such reconstruction; (ii) new construction that is opened to the public as a tolled facility; (iii) new construction that is opened to the public as high-occupancy vehicle lanes; (iv) existing high-occupancy vehicle lanes; or (v) an existing lane on a segment of a highway whose length does not exceed 10 miles and is between an interchange and an interchange or an interchange and a bridge, provided that the number of un-tolled non-high-occupancy vehicle lanes on such segment is equal to the number of un-tolled non-high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the portion of the highway preceding such segment.\n\nC. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, prior approval of the General Assembly shall be required prior to the imposition and collection of any toll for use of all or any portion of (i) a non-limited access highway except for a bridge, tunnel, or the approaches to a bridge or tunnel; (ii) Interstate 81; or (iii) any primary highway that is wholly located in Planning District 8 and that was previously classified as a secondary highway and is between 30 and 35 miles in length.\n\n2016, c. 780; 2017, c. 836; 2018, Sp.

An increase in the CAFE standards from the current standard by promoting performance-based tax credits for advanced technology, fuel-efficient vehicles to facilitate the introduction and purchase of such vehicles; and\n\n2. Market incentives and education programs to build demand for high-efficiency, cleaner vehicles, including tax incentives for highly efficient vehicles.\n\n2006, c. 939, §§ 67-800, 67-801; 2021, Sp.
