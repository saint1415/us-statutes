The market value shall be determined as of (i) the date of death if a decedent's estate; (ii) the date assets are received by the trustee if a trust; or (iii) the date of qualification in all other cases. Any reasonable expense incurred in determining such values shall be allowable as a cost of the administration of the estate.\n\nE. In the case of assets discovered or received by a fiduciary after filing an inventory, the further inventory required by subsections A, B, and C may be made by filing an amended inventory showing all assets of the estate or trust, by filing an additional inventory showing only the after-discovered assets or, with the permission of the commissioner of accounts, by showing the after-discovered assets on the estate's or trust's next regular accounting.

If all distributees of a decedent's estate or all residuary beneficiaries under a decedent's will are personal representatives of that decedent's estate, whether serving alone or with others who are not distributees or residuary beneficiaries, the personal representatives may, in lieu of the settlement of accounts required by § 64.2-1304, file with the commissioner of accounts a statement under oath that (i) all known charges against the estate have been paid, (ii) six months have elapsed since the personal representatives qualified in the clerk's office, and (iii) the residue of the estate has been delivered to the distributees or beneficiaries. In the case of a residuary beneficiary, the statement shall include an itemized listing, substantiated and accompanied by proper vouchers, showing satisfaction of all other bequests in the will. The statement shall be considered an account stated and subject to all the provisions of this chapter applicable to accounts stated.\n\nC. If the statement authorized by this section cannot be filed with the commissioner of accounts within the time prescribed by § 64.2-1304, the personal representatives, within that time, shall file either (i) an interim account or (ii) a written notice under oath that the personal representatives intend to file a statement in lieu of the settlement of accounts when all requirements of this section have been met, which shall include an explanation of why such a statement cannot presently be filed. Second and subsequent interim accounts or notices of intent to file shall be filed annually until the statement in lieu of the settlement of accounts is filed. A commissioner of accounts who determines that the reasons offered for not presently filing a statement in lieu of settlement are not sufficient, whether in a first or subsequent written notice, may require the personal representatives to file an interim account in addition to the notice. The filing of an interim account shall not preclude the filing of a subsequent statement.\n\n1960, c. 428, § 26-20.1; 1972, c. 326; 1975, c. 192; 1980, c. 199; 1981, c. 113; 1983, c. 328; 1984, c. 309; 1993, c. 525; 1998, c. 610; 2001, c. 107; 2012, c. 614; 2017, c. 638.",

When the judicial proceeding is conducted in the same court in which the fiduciary qualified, the clerk of such court shall make the memoranda and recordations required by this section, and shall for such purpose use the original papers.
