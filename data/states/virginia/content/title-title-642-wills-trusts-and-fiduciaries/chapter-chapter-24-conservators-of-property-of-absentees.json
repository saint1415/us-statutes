For purposes of this chapter:\n\n\"Absentee\" means a person who is a resident of the Commonwealth or a nonresident of the Commonwealth who has an interest in any property located within the Commonwealth who (i) disappears or absents himself from his usual place of residence, (ii) is reported or listed as missing or missing in action, or (iii) is interned in a neutral country or captured by an enemy country.\n\nB. Upon the filing of a petition for the appointment of a conservator, the court having probate jurisdiction in the city or county of the absentee's legal residence or, if such absentee is a nonresident, the court having probate jurisdiction in the city or county where the property is located, may appoint, upon good cause shown, a conservator to take charge of the absentee's estate. If the absentee is a nonresident, the petition shall allege the facts and show the necessity for providing for the care of the property of the absentee. The petition may be filed by any person who would have an interest in the property of the absentee were he deceased, including a creditor of the absentee, or made on the court's own motion, and after notice is given to the heirs and next of kin of such absentee, as provided by law.\n\n1944, p. 361; Michie Suppl. 1946, § 5400b; Code 1950, § 26-68; 2012, c. 614.",
