The Department of Housing and Community shall develop guidelines governing the use of the Fund and including criteria for project eligibility that considers the extent to which a grant or loan will facilitate the use or reuse of the existing residential property, the extent to which a grant or loan will meet the needs of a recipient, the potential restoration of the property, the economic and environmental benefits to the surrounding community, and the extent of the perceived or real environmental contamination at the site.\n\n2010, c. 820.",
