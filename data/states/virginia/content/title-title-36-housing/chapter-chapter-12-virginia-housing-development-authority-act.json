      "text": "It is hereby declared: (i) that there exists within the Commonwealth a serious shortage of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford; that this shortage has contributed to and will contribute to the creation and persistence of substandard living conditions and is inimical to the health, welfare and prosperity of the residents of the Commonwealth; (ii) that it is imperative that the supply of residential housing for such persons and families and for persons and families displaced by public actions or natural disaster be increased; (iii) that private enterprise and investment have been unable, without assistance, to produce the needed construction or rehabilitation of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford and to provide sufficient long-term mortgage financing for residential housing for occupancy by such persons and families; (iv) that a concentration of persons and families of low and moderate income even in standard structures does not eliminate undesirable social conditions; (v) that the governing body of a city or county may in its discretion determine that it is necessary to the preservation of the financial viability of such city or county and the health, welfare and prosperity of its residents that the population of such city or county be maintained as economically mixed by providing housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income in order to broaden the tax bases of such areas; (vi) that in providing sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford it may at times be necessary or desirable to provide housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income; (vii) that it is critical to the success, prosperity and viability of areas being revitalized that financing be made available for nonhousing buildings that are incidental to residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other persons and families in order to provide products and services to those living in residential housing or that are necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such areas or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such areas; (viii) that the financing of residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other persons and families may be appropriate to promote the industrial, commercial or other economic development of certain areas in a city or the county by inducing manufacturing, industrial, commercial, governmental, educational, entertainment, community development, healthcare or nonprofit enterprises or undertakings to locate or remain in such area; and (ix) that private enterprise and investment be encouraged both to sponsor land development and build and rehabilitate residential housing for such persons and families of low and moderate income and to build housing which will prevent the recurrence of slum conditions by housing persons of varied economic means in the same projects or area, and that private financing be supplemented by financing as provided in this chapter in order to help prevent the creation and recurrence of substandard living conditions and to assist in their permanent elimination throughout Virginia.\n\nIt is further declared that in order to provide a fully adequate supply of sanitary and safe dwelling accommodations at rents, prices, or other costs which such persons or families can afford and to stabilize or recover an appropriate economic mix in certain areas of the Commonwealth the legislature finds that it is necessary to create and establish a state housing development authority for the purpose of encouraging the investment of private capital and stimulating the construction and rehabilitation of residential housing to meet the needs of such persons and families or to stabilize such areas through the use of public financing, to provide construction and mortgage loans and to make provision for the purchase of mortgage loans and otherwise.\n\nIt is hereby further declared to be necessary and in the public interest that such state housing development authority provide for predevelopment costs, temporary financing, land development expenses and residential housing construction or rehabilitation by private sponsors for sale or rental to persons and families of low and moderate income and others; further, to provide mortgage financing for the purposes of supplying sanitary and safe dwelling accommodations at rents, prices or other costs which such persons or families can afford or of stabilizing urban areas, including without limitation, long-term federally insured mortgages; further, in revitalization areas designated in or pursuant to § 36-55.30:2, to provide financing for nonhousing buildings that are incidental to residential housing financed or to be financed in such areas pursuant to this chapter for low and moderate income persons and families and for other persons and families or that are necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such areas or the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such areas; further, to increase the construction and rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing through the purchase from mortgage lenders authorized to make loans in the Commonwealth of mortgage loans for residential housing for persons and families of low and moderate income in the Commonwealth; further, to acquire, develop and own multifamily residential housing for occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income; further, to provide technical, consultative and project assistance services to private sponsors; further, to assist in coordinating federal, state, regional and local public and private efforts and resources; to guarantee to the extent provided herein the repayment of certain loans secured by residential mortgages; further, to promote wise usage of land and other resources in order to preserve the quality of life we value so highly in Virginia; and further, to act as the loan servicer for a housing lender.\n\nIt is hereby further declared that all of the foregoing are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted, and that such activities serve a public purpose in improving or otherwise benefiting the people of the Commonwealth; that the necessity of enacting the provisions hereinafter set forth is in the public interest and is hereby so declared as a matter of express legislative determination.\n\n1972, c. 830; 1975, c. 536;

For the sole purpose of empowering the HDA to provide financing in accordance with this chapter, the governing body of any city or county may by resolution designate an area within such city or county as a revitalization area if such governing body shall in such resolution make the following determinations with respect to such area: (i) either (a) the area is blighted, deteriorated, deteriorating or, if not rehabilitated, likely to deteriorate by reason that the buildings, improvements or other facilities in such area are subject to one or more of the following conditions: dilapidation; obsolescence; overcrowding; inadequate ventilation, light or sanitation; excessive land coverage; deleterious land use; or faulty or inadequate design, quality or condition; or (b) the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such area will benefit the city or county but such area lacks the housing needed to induce manufacturing, industrial, commercial, governmental, educational, entertainment, community development, healthcare or nonprofit enterprises or undertakings to locate or remain in such area; and (ii) private enterprise and investment are not reasonably expected, without assistance, to produce the construction or rehabilitation of decent, safe and sanitary housing and supporting facilities that will meet the needs of low and moderate income persons and families in such area and will induce other persons and families to live within such area and thereby create a desirable economic mix of residents in such area. Any redevelopment area, conservation area, or rehabilitation area created or designated by the city or county pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ 36-1 et seq.) of this title, any census tract in which 70 percent or more of the families have incomes which are 80 percent or less of the statewide median income as determined by the federal government pursuant to Section 143 of the United States Internal Revenue Code or any successor code provision on the basis of the most recent decennial census for which data are available, and any census tract which is designated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and, for the most recent year for which census data are available on household income in such tract, either in which 50 percent or more of the households have an income which is less than 60 percent of the area median gross income for such year or which has a poverty rate of at least 25 percent shall be deemed to be designated as a revitalization area without adoption of the above described resolution of the city or county. In any revitalization area, the HDA may provide financing for one or more economically mixed projects and, in conjunction therewith, any nonhousing buildings that are incidental to such project or projects or are determined by the governing body of the city or county to be necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such area or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development thereof.\n\nB. The HDA may finance an economically mixed project that is not within a revitalization area if the governing body of the city or county in which such project is or will be located shall by resolution determine (i) either (a) that the ability to provide residential housing and supporting facilities that serve persons or families of lower or moderate income will be enhanced if a portion of the units therein are occupied or held available for occupancy by persons and families who are not of low and moderate income or (b) that the surrounding area of such project is, or is expected in the future to be, inhabited predominantly by lower income persons and families and will benefit from an economic mix of residents in such project and (ii) private enterprise and investment are not reasonably expected, without assistance, to produce the construction or rehabilitation of decent, safe and sanitary housing and supporting facilities that will meet the needs of low and moderate income persons and families in such area and will induce other persons and families to live within such area and thereby create a desirable economic mix of residents in such area.\n\nC. In any economically mixed project financed under this section, the percentage of units occupied or held available for occupancy by persons and families who are not of low and moderate income, as determined as of the date of their initial occupancy of such units, shall not exceed 80 percent.\n\n1979, c. 374; 1996, cc. 77, 498; 2004, c. 187; 2006, c. 784.",

The ratio of mortgage loan principal amount to total housing development costs and the amortization period of any mortgage loans made by HDA which are federally insured mortgages, in whole or in part, or which are otherwise assisted or aided, directly or indirectly, by the federal government, shall be governed by the rules and regulations provided in or pursuant to the federal government program under which the HDA mortgage loan or part thereof is insured, guaranteed, assisted or aided; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years.\n\n2. A mortgage loan made by HDA may be prepaid to maturity after a period of years, and on such terms and conditions, as are determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.\n\n3. HDA shall have authority to establish and modify from time to time the interest rates at which it shall make mortgage loans and commitments therefor. Such interest rates shall be established by HDA in its sole discretion at the lowest level consistent with HDA's cost of operation and its responsibilities to the holders of its bonds, bond anticipation notes and other obligations. In addition to such interest charges, HDA may make and collect such fees and charges, including but not limited to reimbursement of HDA's financing costs, service charges, insurance premiums and mortgage insurance premiums, as HDA determines to be reasonable. No person shall, by way of defense or otherwise, avail himself of any of the provisions of Chapter 3 (§ 6.2-300 et seq.) of Title 6.2 to avoid or defeat the payment of any interest or fee which he shall have contracted to pay on any loan or forbearance of money made, directly or indirectly, or assisted in any manner by HDA under or pursuant to this chapter.\n\nB. Mortgage loans made by HDA to housing sponsors to finance the ownership and operation of housing developments and multifamily residential housing intended for occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income, pursuant to subdivision (10) of § 36-55.31, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:\n\n1. The amount disbursed with respect to an HDA mortgage loan to a limited profit housing sponsor shall not exceed 95 percent of the total housing development costs and to a nonprofit housing sponsor shall not exceed 100 percent of the total housing development costs. Subsequent to the disbursement of such amount, additional amounts may be from time to time disbursed if the sum of the amount to be so disbursed and the then outstanding principal balance of the HDA mortgage loan does not exceed 95 percent of the market value of the housing development or residential housing as then determined by the Authority. The amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years.\n\n2. The instrument evidencing any such HDA mortgage loan and the mortgage securing any such HDA mortgage loan shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed or approved by HDA. The aforesaid mortgage and instrument evidencing an HDA mortgage loan may contain exculpatory provisions relieving the housing sponsor or its principal or principals from personal liability if deemed desirable by HDA.\n\n3. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan made to a limited profit housing sponsor, HDA may require that such limited profit housing sponsor not make distributions in any one year with respect to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan in excess of such percentage of such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing as may be determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for such mortgage loan. None of the partners, principals, stockholders or holders of a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor shall earn, accept or receive a return in any one year with respect to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan greater than his applicable proportion of any such percentage of such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing as may be determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan. The right to any such limited distribution or return may be cumulative to the extent provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan. For the purpose of this section, the terms \"distribution\" and \"return\" are intended to mean payments on account of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan resulting from the operation thereof. Any payment to a person or entity who is a partner, principal, stockholder or holder of a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor shall not be deemed a \"distribution\" or \"return\" to such person or entity if the funds with which such payment is made are funds paid or contributed to such limited profit housing sponsor by persons or entities purchasing a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor. At or after the completion of construction, rehabilitation or improvement of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan, such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing shall be established in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for such mortgage loan. Such equity shall be determined by HDA, at its option, as either (i) the difference between the total housing development costs as to the housing development or multifamily residential housing and the final principal amount of such HDA mortgage loan, or (ii) the difference between the fair market value of such housing development and the final principal amount of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may thereafter from time to time adjust such equity to be equal to the difference, as of the date of adjustment, between the fair market value of such housing development and the outstanding principal balance of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may review and regulate a proposed retirement of any capital investment in, or redemption of any stock of, such limited profit housing sponsor in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.\n\n4. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the housing sponsor and other parties related to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such housing sponsor and its partners, principals or stockholders to limitations established by HDA as to rentals and other charges, profits, fees, the use and disposition of the real property constituting the site of or relating to the housing development or multifamily residential housing and other property of such housing sponsor, and the use and disposition of franchises of such housing sponsor to the extent more restrictive limitations are not provided by the law under which such housing sponsor is incorporated or organized.\n\n5. As a condition of any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA shall have the power to supervise the housing sponsor in accordance with the provisions of § 36-55.34:1 at all times during which such HDA mortgage loan is outstanding and thereafter as necessary to preserve the federal tax exemption of the notes or bonds issued by HDA to finance such HDA mortgage loan.\n\nC. Mortgage loans made by HDA to persons and families of low and moderate income to finance the purchase or refinancing of single-family residential housing, pursuant to subdivision (11) of § 36-55.31, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:\n\n1. The amount disbursed with respect to such HDA mortgage loan shall not exceed 100 percent of the sales price or market value of the single-family residential housing, as determined or approved by or on behalf of HDA. HDA may also disburse additional amounts to finance such closing costs and fees as it may deem necessary or appropriate, and all such disbursements and financings of closing costs and fees subsequent to the enactment of this chapter are hereby validated. The amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years. If during the term of the HDA mortgage loan (i) the outstanding principal balance of the HDA mortgage loan is expected to increase to an amount in excess of the original principal balance or (ii) the amount of monthly payments on the HDA mortgage loan will or may be adjusted, HDA shall so notify the applicants prior to the execution of the HDA mortgage loan. Such notice shall describe the terms and conditions under which the outstanding principal balance or the amount of monthly payments, or both, may be so increased or adjusted, and such notice shall be signed by the applicants.\n\n2. Such an HDA mortgage loan shall be made only after a determination that such a mortgage loan is not otherwise available from private lenders upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions, and the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan shall contain such a determination.\n\n3. The instrument evidencing any such HDA mortgage loan and the mortgage securing any such HDA mortgage loan shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed or approved by HDA. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the person or family of low or moderate income to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such person or family of low or moderate income relating to the use, occupancy, maintenance and sale of the single-family residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan and the payment, prepayment and assignment of such HDA mortgage loan.\n\nD. Mortgage loans made by HDA to housing sponsors or persons or families of low or moderate income to finance the construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement of housing developments or residential housing intended, upon completion of such construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement, for ownership or occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income, pursuant to subdivision (12) of § 36-55.31 of this chapter, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:\n\n1. The amount disbursed with respect to such an HDA mortgage loan to a limited profit housing sponsor shall not exceed 95 percent of the total housing development costs and to a nonprofit housing sponsor or a person or family of low or moderate income shall not exceed 100 percent of the total housing development costs. Subsequent to the disbursement of such amount, additional amounts may be from time to time disbursed if the sum of the amount to be so disbursed and the then outstanding principal balance of the HDA mortgage loan does not exceed 95 percent of the market value of the housing development or residential housing as then determined by the Authority. Without regard as to whether HDA intends to remain the lender in respect to such mortgage loan throughout the amortization period thereof, the amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.\n\n2. In considering any application for such an HDA mortgage loan, HDA shall give first priority to applications relating to housing developments or residential housing which are or will be well-planned and well-designed, and also shall give consideration to:\n\na. The comparative need for housing for persons and families of low and moderate income in the area proposed to be served by the housing development or residential housing;\n\nb. The ability of the applicant to construct, rehabilitate or improve and market or operate, manage and maintain the housing development or residential housing;\n\nc. The existence of zoning or other regulations to protect adequately the housing development or residential housing against detrimental future uses which could cause undue depreciation in the value of the housing development or residential housing;\n\nd. The availability of adequate parks, recreational areas, utilities, schools, transportation and parking; and\n\ne. The existence of statewide housing plans.\n\n3. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the housing sponsor, person or family of low or moderate income, contractors, architects, marketing agents, management agents and other parties related to the housing development or residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such housing sponsor and its partners, principals or stockholders or such person or family of low or moderate income to limitations established by HDA as to rentals and other charges, profits, fees, the use and disposition of the real property constituting the site of or relating to the housing development or residential housing and other property of such housing sponsor, and the use and disposition of franchises of such housing sponsor to the extent more restrictive limitations are not provided by the law under which such housing sponsor is incorporated or organized.

As a condition of any such HDA mortgage loan to a housing sponsor, HDA shall have the power to supervise such housing sponsor in accordance with the provisions of § 36-55.34:1 at all times during which such HDA mortgage loan is outstanding and thereafter as necessary to preserve the federal tax exemption of the notes or bonds issued by HDA to finance such HDA mortgage loan.\n\n5. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, the provisions of subdivisions 2 and 3 of subsection B of this section shall be applicable.\n\nE. Mortgage loans made by HDA pursuant to subdivision 13 of § 36-55.31 to finance the construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement, or ownership and operation, of economically mixed projects or portions thereof and, if any such project is within a revitalization area designated in or pursuant to § 36-55.30:2, any nonhousing buildings that are incidental to such project or are determined by such governing body of the city or county to be necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such area or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such area shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:\n\n1. The principal amount of such an HDA mortgage loan shall not exceed 95 percent of the total housing development costs, and the amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or in the commitment for, such mortgage loan; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years.\n\n2. Such an HDA mortgage loan shall be made only if the provisions of § 36-55.30:2 are satisfied.\n\n3. The instrument evidencing any such HDA mortgage loan and the mortgage securing any such HDA mortgage loan shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed or approved by HDA. The aforesaid mortgage and instrument evidencing an HDA mortgage loan may contain exculpatory provisions relieving a housing sponsor, if any, or its principal or principals from personal liability if deemed desirable by HDA.\n\n4. The nonhousing buildings shall be financed by such an HDA mortgage loan only if the HDA shall receive a certification from the housing sponsor that a mortgage loan for the financing of such nonhousing buildings is not otherwise available from private lenders upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions.\n\n1975, c. 536; 1979, c. 374; 1982, c. 176; 1987, c. 164; 1988, c. 556; 1989, c. 161; 1991, c. 447; 2004, c. 187; 2010, c. 794.",

For the purposes of this section, HDA may form corporations, joint ventures, partnerships, trusts or other legal entities or any combination thereof, on its own behalf or in conjunction with individuals or other public or private entities, to serve as housing sponsors for multi-family residential housing developments; may acquire, own, encumber, pledge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of interests in such housing sponsors; may provide financing and other funding to such housing sponsors; and may exercise all necessary or convenient rights and powers and perform all requisite duties and obligations relating thereto. HDA shall not exercise the powers granted under this section with respect to any multi-family residential housing development, unless HDA makes the following findings:\n\n1. That there exists a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing at rentals or prices which persons and families of low income or moderate income can afford within the general housing market area to be served by the proposed housing development.\n\n2. That private enterprise and investment have been unable, without assistance, to provide the needed decent, safe and sanitary housing at rentals or prices which persons or families of low and moderate income can afford.\n\n3. That private sponsors would not be willing, without assistance, to undertake the proposed housing development upon substantially similar terms and conditions.\n\n4. That HDA has not received notification from both the local housing authority having jurisdiction over the area in which the housing development would be located and the sponsor of such development that it is the preference of both parties that the local housing authority undertake the proposed housing development.\n\n5. That the proposed housing development will provide well-planned, well-designed housing for persons or families of low and moderate income.\n\n6. That the housing development will be of public use and will provide a public benefit.\n\n7. That the housing development will be undertaken within the authority conferred by this chapter upon HDA.\n\nB. HDA shall also find, in connection with the new construction or substantial rehabilitation by HDA of any proposed multi-family residential housing development, that the governing body of the locality in which such housing development is to be located has not, within sixty days after written notification of such proposed construction or substantial rehabilitation has been sent by HDA to such governing body and to any local housing authority having jurisdiction in such locality, certified to HDA in writing its disapproval of the proposed multi-family residential housing development. The foregoing notwithstanding, no such finding need be made if HDA has received from the governing body its certified resolution approving the proposed housing development.\n\nC. At least sixty days prior to purchasing, acquiring, constructing or rehabilitating any multi-family residential housing development pursuant to this section, HDA shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality in which such development is to be located. Such notice (i) shall state that HDA intends to purchase, acquire, construct or rehabilitate a multi-family residential housing development or developments in such locality and shall solicit proposals from interested parties for such purchase, acquisition, construction or rehabilitation or (ii) shall identify the multi-family residential housing development or developments to be purchased, acquired, constructed or rehabilitated and shall request comments from the general public with respect to such proposed purchase, acquisition, construction or rehabilitation.\n\nD. In the event HDA or any legal entity formed by HDA is to construct or rehabilitate a multi-family residential housing development pursuant to this section, HDA or such legal entity shall contract with a private firm for the performance of such construction and rehabilitation, unless HDA determines that no responsible private firm would be willing and able to contract for such construction or rehabilitation at a price necessary for the financial feasibility of such development. HDA or any legal entity formed by HDA shall contract with a private firm or public body for the performance of management services for any multi-family residential housing development owned by HDA or such legal entity pursuant to this section, unless HDA determines that no responsible private firm and no public body would be willing and able to contract for the performance of such management services at a price necessary for the financial feasibility of such development. For the purpose of this subsection, the term \"private firm\" shall include an individual, joint venture, partnership, stock corporation, trust or other similar business entity legally authorized to perform the construction, rehabilitation or management, as may be applicable, of the proposed multi-family residential housing development.\n\n1987, c. 254; 1991, c. 206; 1996, c. 298.",

That in its judgment the loan would in all respects be a prudent investment; and\n\n2. That the proceeds of sale or its equivalent shall be reinvested as provided in subsection F of this section, or invested in short-term obligations pending such reinvestment. However, certification pursuant to this subsection shall not be required in the case of the purchase or commitment to purchase by HDA of a mortgage loan held, insured or assisted by the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof.\n\nB. HDA shall purchase mortgage loans at a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal balance; however, discount from the principal balance or the payment of a premium may be employed to effect a fair rate of return which in the opinion of HDA is consistent with the obligations of the HDA hereunder and the purposes of this chapter. In addition to the aforesaid payment of outstanding principal balance HDA shall pay the accrued interest due thereon, on the date the loan or obligation is delivered against payment therefor. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the purchase by HDA of a mortgage loan held, insured or assisted by the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in which case the purchase price shall be determined by agreement of HDA and the mortgage lender.\n\nC. Loans purchased or sold hereunder may include but shall not be limited to loans which are insured, guaranteed or assisted by the federal government or for which there is a commitment by the federal government to insure, guarantee or assist such loan.\n\nD.

The interest rate or rates and other terms of the loans to mortgage lenders made from the proceeds of any issue of bonds of the HDA shall be at least sufficient so as to assure the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due from the amounts received by HDA in repayment of such loans and interest thereon.\n\nF. HDA shall require as a condition of each loan to a mortgage lender and as a condition of the purchase or the making of a commitment to purchase mortgage loans from a mortgage lender that such mortgage lender within such period of time following the receipt of the proceeds as shall be prescribed by rules and regulations of HDA, shall have entered into written commitments to make, and shall thereafter proceed as promptly as practicable to make and disburse from such proceeds, residential mortgage loans in the Commonwealth of Virginia having a stated maturity of not less than twenty years from the date thereof in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of such proceeds. HDA shall not purchase nor make commitment to purchase mortgage loans or obligations from a mortgage lender from which it has previously purchased mortgage loans nor make a loan to a mortgage lender to which it has previously made a loan unless said mortgage lender has either restored or made commitments to restore to its portfolio of residential mortgage loans in the Commonwealth of Virginia, residential mortgage loans having a stated maturity of not less than twenty years from the date thereof in an aggregate principal amount equal to either the proceeds of prior sale or the amount of prior loan to said mortgage lender. HDA may require the submission to it by each mortgage lender of evidence satisfactory to it of the making of such new residential mortgage loans. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the purchase or commitment to purchase by HDA of a mortgage loan held, insured or assisted by the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof or a mortgage loan that, when made by the mortgage lender, is to be purchased by HDA.\n\nG. HDA shall require that such loans to mortgage lenders shall be additionally secured as to payment of both principal and interest by a pledge of and lien upon collateral security in such amounts as HDA shall by resolution determine to be necessary to assure the payment of such loans and the interest thereon as the same become due. Such collateral security shall consist of (a) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by, the United States of America or the Commonwealth of Virginia; (b) bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, satisfactory to the HDA, issued by any of the following federal agencies: Bank for Cooperatives, Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank System, Export-Import Bank of Washington, Federal Land Banks, the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Government National Mortgage Association; (c) direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed by the Commonwealth; or (d) mortgages insured or guaranteed, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the HDA, by the federal government or private mortgage insurance companies as to payment of principal and interest.\n\n1972, c. 830; 1975, c. 536; 1982, c. 101; 1996, c. 298; 2011, cc. 218, 224.",

HDA shall notify the applicant and the proposed lender of its decision. Any such approval shall be conditioned upon payment to HDA, within such reasonable time and after notification of approval as may be specified by HDA, of the commitment fee prescribed by HDA.\n\n(3) HDA shall fix mortgage insurance premiums for the insurance of mortgage payments under the provisions of this chapter. Such premiums shall be computed as a percentage of the principal of the mortgage outstanding at the beginning of each mortgage year, but shall not be more than one-half of one per centum per year of such principal amount. The amount of premium need not be uniform for all insured loans. Such premiums shall be payable by mortgagors or mortgagees in such manner as prescribed by HDA.\n\n(4) In the event of default by the mortgagor, the mortgagee shall notify HDA both of the default and the mortgagee's proposed course of action. When it appears feasible, HDA may for a temporary period upon default or threatened default by the mortgagor authorize mortgage payments to be made by HDA to the mortgagee which payments shall be repaid under such conditions as HDA may prescribe. HDA may also agree to revised terms of financing when such appear prudent. The mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance provided herein upon: (a) Any sale of the mortgaged property by court order in foreclosure or a sale with the consent of HDA by the mortgagor or a subsequent owner of the property or by the mortgagee after foreclosure or acquisition by deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising from the mortgage, foreclosure, or any deficiency judgment shall be assigned to HDA without recourse except such claims as may have been released with the consent of HDA; or (b) the expiration of six months after the mortgagee has taken title to the mortgaged property under judgment of strict foreclosure, foreclosure by sale or other judicial sale, or under a deed in lieu of foreclosure if during such period the mortgagee has made a bona fide attempt to sell the property, and thereafter conveys the property to HDA with an assignment, without recourse, to HDA of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising out of the mortgage foreclosure, or deficiency judgment; or (c) the acceptance by HDA of title to the property or an assignment of the mortgage, without recourse to HDA, in the event HDA determines it imprudent to proceed under (a) or (b) above.

HDA shall have power and is hereby authorized to issue from time to time its negotiable notes and bonds in conformity with applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in such principal amount as HDA shall determine to be necessary to provide sufficient funds for achieving any of its corporate purposes, including the payment of interest on notes and bonds of HDA, establishment of reserves to secure such notes and bonds, and all other expenditures of HDA incident to and necessary or convenient to carry out its corporate purposes and powers. In accordance with § 2.2-5002, such power to issue notes and bonds shall not be restricted or limited solely because the interest on the notes and bonds is subject, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxes.\n\n2. HDA shall have the power, from time to time, to issue (i) notes to renew notes and (ii) bonds, to pay notes, including the interest thereon and, whenever it deems refunding expedient, to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and to issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any of its corporate purposes. The refunding bonds may be (i) exchanged for the bonds to be refunded or (ii) sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase, redemption or payment of such bonds.\n\n3. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by HDA, every issue of its notes and bonds shall be general obligations of HDA payable out of any revenues or moneys of HDA, subject only to any agreements with the holders of particular notes or bonds pledging any particular revenues.\n\nB. The notes and bonds shall be authorized by resolution or resolutions of HDA, shall bear such date or dates and shall mature at such time or times as such resolution or resolutions may provide, except that no bond shall mature more than fifty years from the date of its issue. The bonds may be issued as serial bonds payable in annual installments or as term bonds or as a combination thereof. The notes and bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption as such resolution or resolutions may provide. The notes and bonds of HDA may be sold by HDA, at public or private sale, at such price or prices as HDA shall determine.\n\nC. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any notes or bonds or any issue thereof may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract or contracts with the holders thereof, as to:\n\n1. Pledging all or any part of the revenues to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue thereof, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist;\n\n2. Pledging all or any part of the assets of HDA, including mortgages and obligations securing the same, to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue of notes or bonds, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist;\n\n3. The use and disposition of the gross income from mortgages owned by HDA and payment of principal of mortgages owned by HDA;\n\n4. The setting aside of reserves or sinking funds and the regulation and disposition thereof;\n\n5. Limitations on the purpose to which the proceeds of sale of notes or bonds may be applied and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue thereof;\n\n6. Limitations on the issuance of additional notes or bonds; the terms upon which additional notes or bonds may be issued and secured; and the refunding of outstanding or other notes or bonds;\n\n7. The procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with noteholders or bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of notes or bonds the holders of which must consent thereto; and the manner in which such consent may be given;\n\n8. Limitations on the amount of moneys to be expended by HDA for operating expenses of HDA;\n\n9. Vesting in a trustee or trustees such property, rights, powers and duties in trust as HDA may determine, which may include any or all of the rights, powers and duties of the trustee appointed by the bondholders pursuant to this chapter and limiting or abrogating the right of the bondholders to appoint a trustee under this chapter or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee;\n\n10. Defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the obligations and duties of HDA to the holders of the notes or bonds and providing for the rights and remedies of the holders of the notes or bonds in the event of such default, including as a matter of right the appointment of a receiver; provided, however, that such rights and remedies shall not be inconsistent with the general laws of the Commonwealth and the other provisions of this chapter;\n\n11. Any other matters, of like or different character, which in any way affect the security or protection of the holders of the notes or bonds.\n\nD. Any pledge made by HDA shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; HDA's interest, then existing or thereafter obtained, in the revenues, moneys, mortgage loans, receivables, contract rights or other property or proceeds so pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against HDA, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded, nor shall any filing be required with respect thereto.\n\nE. Neither the commissioners of HDA nor any other person executing such notes or bonds shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\nF. HDA, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist, shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase notes or bonds of HDA, which shall thereupon be cancelled unless HDA shall provide written notification to the trustee pursuant to subsection J, at a price not exceeding:\n\n1. If the notes or bonds are then redeemable, the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment thereon, or\n\n2. If the notes or bonds are not then redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after such purchase upon which the notes or bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to such date.\n\nG. In the discretion of HDA, the bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between HDA and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of HDA in relation to the exercise of its corporate powers and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. HDA may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of HDA. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\nH. Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\nI. In case any of the commissioners or officers of HDA whose signatures appear on any notes or bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such notes or bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery.\n\nJ. Notwithstanding any statute or case law to the contrary, the purchase or actual or constructive ownership by HDA of any of its notes or bonds with the intent that such notes or bonds remain outstanding, as evidenced by written notification from HDA to the trustee under the resolution or trust indenture, shall not cause such notes or bonds or the indebtedness evidenced thereby to be canceled or extinguished, subject to such terms and conditions as may be set forth in the written notification and except as may be otherwise provided in the resolution or trust indenture.\n\n1972, c. 830; 1978, c. 189; 1996, c. 298; 1998, c. 442.",

HDA may create and establish one or more special funds (herein referred to as \"capital reserve funds\"), and shall pay into each such capital reserve fund (i) any moneys appropriated and made available by the Commonwealth for the purpose of such fund, (ii) any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of HDA authorizing the issuance thereof, and (iii) any other moneys which may be made available to HDA for the purpose of such fund from any other source or sources. All moneys held in any capital reserve fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used, as required, solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund or of the sinking fund payments hereinafter mentioned with respect to such bonds, the purchase or redemption of such bonds, the payment of interest on such bonds or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; however, if moneys in any such fund at any time are less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement established for such fund as hereinafter provided, HDA shall not use such moneys for any optional purchase or redemption of such bonds. Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, any capital reserve fund due to the investment thereof may be transferred by HDA to other funds or accounts of HDA to the extent it does not reduce the amount of such capital reserve fund below the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund;\n\n2. HDA shall not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a capital reserve fund, if upon the issuance of such bonds, the amount of such capital reserve fund will be less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement of such fund, unless HDA, at the time of issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, will not be less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. For purposes of this section, the term \"minimum capital reserve fund requirement\" shall mean, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money, as provided in the resolutions of HDA authorizing the bonds with respect to which such fund is established, equal to not more than the greatest of the respective amounts, for the current or any future fiscal year of HDA, of annual debt service on the bonds of HDA secured in whole or in part by such fund, such annual debt service for any fiscal year being the amount of money equal to the aggregate of (i) all interest payable during such fiscal year on all bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund outstanding on the date of computation, plus (ii) the principal amount of all such bonds outstanding on said date of computation which mature during such fiscal year, plus (iii) all amounts specified in any resolution of the authority authorizing any of such bonds as payable during such fiscal year as a sinking fund payment with respect to any of such bonds which mature after such fiscal year, all calculated on the assumption that such bonds will after said date of computation cease to be outstanding by reason, but only by reason, of the payment of bonds when due, and the payment when due and application in accordance with the resolution authorizing those bonds, of all of such sinking fund payments payable at or after said date of computation; however, in computing the annual debt service for any fiscal year as aforesaid, bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with the defeasance provisions of the resolution or resolutions of HDA authorizing the issuance thereof shall not be included in bonds outstanding on the date of computation aforesaid;\n\n3. In computing the amount of any capital reserve funds for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of such funds shall be invested shall be valued at par or if purchased at less than par, at their cost to HDA;\n\n4. To assure the continued operation and solvency of HDA for the carrying out of its corporate purposes, provision is made in subdivision 1 of this subsection for the accumulation in each capital reserve fund of an amount equal to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund.\n\nB. In order further to assure the maintenance of the foregoing capital reserve funds, the chairman of HDA shall annually, on or before December 1, make and deliver to the Governor and Director of the Budget his certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore each such capital reserve fund to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. Within five days after the beginning of each session of the General Assembly, the Governor shall submit to the presiding officer of each house printed copies of a budget including the sum, if any, required to restore each such capital reserve fund to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. All sums appropriated by the legislature for such restoration and paid shall be deposited by HDA in the applicable capital reserve fund.\n\nC. HDA shall create and establish such other fund or funds as may be necessary or desirable for its corporate purposes.\n\nD. All amounts paid over to HDA by the Commonwealth pursuant to the provisions of this section shall constitute and be accounted for as advances by the Commonwealth to HDA and, subject to the rights of the holders of any bonds or notes of HDA theretofore or thereafter issued, shall be repaid to the Commonwealth without interest from all available operating revenues of HDA in excess of amounts required for the payment of bonds, notes or other obligations of HDA, the capital reserve funds and operating expenses.\n\nE. The outstanding principal amount of notes and bonds issued by HDA secured by capital reserve funds pursuant to this section, other than notes and bonds for which refunding obligations shall have been issued pursuant to § 36-55.42, shall not exceed $1.5 billion. For the purpose of this subdivision, the outstanding principal amount of notes or bonds issued by HDA at a price less than the face amount thereof shall be deemed to be the issue price of such notes or bonds.\n\n1972, c. 830; 1974, c. 263; 1987, c. 451; 1994, c. 378; 1997, c. 41.",
