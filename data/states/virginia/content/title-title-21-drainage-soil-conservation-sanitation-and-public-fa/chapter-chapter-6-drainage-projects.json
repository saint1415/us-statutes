The collection of the assessment shall not be defeated where the proper notices have been given by reason of any defect in the proceedings occurring prior to the order of the court confirming the final report of the board of viewers; but such order or orders shall be conclusive and final that all prior proceedings were regular and according to law, unless they were appealed from. If, on appeal, the court shall deem it just and proper to release any person or to modify his assessment or liability, it shall in no manner affect the rights and liabilities of any person other than the appellant, and the failure to perfect an appeal within sixty days from the order of the court finally establishing the project shall be a waiver of any illegality in the proceedings, and the remedies provided for in this chapter shall exclude all other remedies.\n\nProceedings under this chapter shall have precedence over all others excepting writs of habeas corpus, prohibition, and mandamus and shall be heard at the time set for a hearing by the court or the judge thereof in vacation with the least possible delay. The widest latitude shall be allowed by the court to hasten urgent cases, where evidence is available to prove the serious consequences resulting from the flooding of the cultivated lands for which relief is asked.\n\nCode 1919, § 1779; 1926, p. 627; 1954, c. 642.",
