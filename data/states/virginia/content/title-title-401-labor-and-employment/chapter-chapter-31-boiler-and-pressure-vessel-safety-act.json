The term \"boiler\" shall include fired units for heating or vaporizing liquids other than water where these units are separate from processing systems and are complete within themselves.\n\n1. \"Power boiler\" means a boiler in which steam or other vapor is generated at a pressure of more than fifteen pounds per square inch gauge pressure.\n\n2. \"High pressure, high temperature water boiler\" means a water boiler operating at pressures exceeding 160 pounds per square inch gauge pressure or temperatures exceeding 250 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n3. \"Heating boiler\" means a steam or vapor boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 15 pounds per square inch gauge pressure, or a hot water boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 160 pounds per square inch gauge pressure or temperature not exceeding 250 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nmeans a vessel in which the pressure is obtained from an external source or by the application of heat from an indirect source or from a direct source, other than those vessels defined in subdivision (a) of this section.\n\n(c) \"Certificate inspection\" means an inspection, the report of which is used by the Chief Inspector to decide whether or not a certificate as provided by § 40.1-51.10 may be issued. This certificate inspection shall be an internal inspection when construction permits; otherwise, it shall be as complete an inspection as possible.\n\n(d) \"Board\" means the Safety and Health Codes Board.\n\n(e) \"Owner-user inspection agency\" means any person, firm, partnership or corporation registered with the Chief Inspector and approved by the Board as being legally responsible for inspecting pressure vessels which they operate in Virginia.\n\n(f) \"Examining Board\" means persons appointed by the Chief Inspector to monitor examinations of inspectors.\n\n(g) \"Water heater\" means a vessel used to supply (i) potable hot water or (ii) both space heat and potable water in combination which is directly heated by the combustion of fuels, by electricity or any other source and withdrawn for use external to the system at pressures not to exceed 160 pounds per square inch, or temperatures of 210 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n(h) \"Contract fee inspector\" means any certified boiler inspector contracted to inspect boilers or pressure vessels on an independent basis by the owner or operator of the boiler or pressure vessel.\n\n1972, c. 237; 1974, c. 195; 1986, c. 211; 1993, c. 543; 1996, c. 294.",

The inspection of every hobby or model boiler shall include an examination of or for the following:\n\n1. The fusible plug, if provided in the original design.\n\n2. The safety valve or valves. Such valve or valves shall be (i) marked with an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) stamp, (ii) set at or below the maximum allowable working pressure, and (iii) sealed in a manner that does not allow tampering with the valve without destroying the seal. The requirement of clause (i) shall be waived for model boilers upon the passage of an accumulation test.\n\n3. Internal corrosion.\n\n4. Leakage.\n\n5. The boiler power piping, up to and including the first valve.\n\nC. A hobby or model boiler shall be subjected to nondestructive testing, at the owner's expense, to determine the maximum allowable working pressure in accordance with Boiler and Pressure Vessel Regulations (16VAC25-50-10 et seq.).\n\nD. All hobby and model boilers shall pass a hydrostatic test. The pressure shall be at one and one-quarter maximum allowable working pressure, as determined by the inspection certificate and as deemed necessary based on inspections or other evidence. A hobby or model boiler that does not meet the requirements of the ASME code and is not registered in the Commonwealth shall, at the owner's expense, be tested to one and one-half times the maximum allowable working pressure for hobby boilers and twice the maximum allowable working pressure for model boilers and, to be operated, shall have a successful (i) for lap seam and nonstandard welded boilers only, complete radiographic or ultrasonic examination of the long or longitudinal seam; (ii) ultrasonic examination for metal thickness, and for the purpose of calculating the maximum allowable working pressure, the thinnest reading shall be used; and (iii) for hobby boilers with lap seam construction, dye penetrant or magnetic particle examination for cracks with an ultrasonic or radiographic examination of areas where testing shows possible cracks.\n\nThe requirements of this subsection for hobby boilers only testing to one and one-half times the maximum allowable working pressure or full radiographic or ultrasonic examination may be waived after the initial inspection if the inspector finds that the general standards of subsection B are met and the safety valve or valves are set at the maximum allowable working pressure determined by the following: calculations from the ultrasonic results or 100 pounds per square inch, whichever is lower. If a variance is requested for butt strap hobby boilers, the Commissioner shall not deny such variance request without a given, valid reason.\n\nThe requirements of this subsection for model boilers only for testing to twice the maximum allowable working pressure or full radiographic or ultrasonic examination may be waived after the initial inspection if the inspector finds that the general standards of subsection B are met and the safety valve or valves are set at the maximum allowable working pressure determined by the following: calculations from the ultrasonic results or 100 pounds per square inch, whichever is lower.\n\nAny boiler which has been without a documented inspection within the past twenty years must have a two times maximum allowable working pressure hydro test prior to its operation.\n\nE. Any hobby or model boiler holding a current out-of-state inspection certificate shall be accepted by the Commonwealth of Virginia, provided the inspection standards meet or exceed standards adopted by the Commonwealth.\n\n1999, c. 335; 2000, cc. 879, 898.",
