Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or\n\n2. Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who\n\na. Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or\n\nb. At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was\n\n(1) Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it;\n\n(2) Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use;\n\n(3) Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or\n\n(4) Acquired by accident or mistake.\n\n\"Person\" means a natural person, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity.\n\n\"Trade secret\" means information, including but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:\n\n1. Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\n\n2. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\n1986, c. 210; 2009, cc. 321, 376.",

Upon application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.\n\nB. In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.\n\nC. In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.\n\n1986, c. 210.",

Except where the user of a misappropriated trade secret has made a material and prejudicial change in his position prior to having either knowledge or reason to know of the misappropriation and the court determines that a monetary recovery would be inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. If a complainant is unable to prove a greater amount of damages by other methods of measurement, the damages caused by misappropriation can be measured exclusively by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.\n\nB. If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award punitive damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection A of this section, or $350,000 whichever amount is less.\n\n1986, c. 210; 1990, c. 344.",
