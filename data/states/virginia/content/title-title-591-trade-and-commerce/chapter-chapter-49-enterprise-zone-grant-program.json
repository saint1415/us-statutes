Upon the Department's announcement of periodic zone designation competitions, the governing body of any county or city may make written application to the Department to have an area or areas declared an enterprise zone. Such application shall include a description of the area or areas to be included, the development potential of these areas, the need for special state incentives, the local incentives that shall be provided to support new economic activity, and other information that the Department deems necessary to assess requests for designation.\n\nB. Two or more adjacent localities may file a joint application for an enterprise zone. Localities applying for a joint zone shall demonstrate a regional need for an enterprise zone and a regional impact that could not be achieved through a single jurisdiction zone. Applicants for a joint zone shall also specify what mechanisms will be used to ensure that the economic benefits of such a zone are shared among the applicant localities.\n\nC. An enterprise zone may consist of no more than three noncontiguous areas. The aggregate size of these noncontiguous zone areas shall be as follows:\n\n1. For cities, the minimum size of an enterprise zone shall be one-quarter square mile and the maximum size of an enterprise zone shall be one square mile or seven percent of the jurisdiction's land area or an area that includes seven percent of the population, whichever is largest.\n\n2. For towns designated as enterprise zones under former §§ 59.1-272 through 59.1-278, 59.1-279.1, or 59.1-280.2 through 59.1-284 of the Enterprise Zone Act (§ 59.1-270 et seq.), the size of an enterprise zone shall conform to the size requirements for cities in subdivision 1.\n\n3. For unincorporated areas of counties, the minimum size of an enterprise zone shall be one-half square mile and the maximum size of an enterprise zone shall be six square miles.\n\n4. For consolidated cities the enterprise zones in cities for which the boundaries were created through the consolidation of a city and county or the consolidation of two cities, the enterprise zone shall conform substantially to the size requirements for unincorporated areas of counties in subdivision 3.\n\nIn no instance shall a zone consist only of a site for a single business firm. Localities shall be limited to three enterprise zone designations.\n\nD. A joint enterprise zone shall consist of no more than three noncontiguous zone areas for each participating locality. The aggregate size of these noncontiguous areas shall be specified by regulation.\n\nE. Upon recommendation of the Director of the Department, the Governor may designate up to 30 enterprise zones in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such designations are to be done in coordination with the expiration of existing zones designated under earlier Enterprise Zone Program provisions. The initial round of six zone designation applications and approval may be conducted prior to adoption of final program regulations provided that the process is consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Enterprise zones shall be designated for an initial 10-year period except as provided for in subsections A and B of § 59.1-546. Upon recommendation of the Director of the Department, the Governor may renew zones designated on or after July 1, 2005, for up to four five-year renewal periods and zones designated prior to July 1, 2005, for up to two five-year renewal periods. Recommendations for five-year renewals shall be based on the locality's performance of its enterprise zone responsibilities, the continued need for such a zone, and its effectiveness in creating jobs and capital investment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, any enterprise zone in effect as of June 30, 2024, shall be extended for an additional four-year period, in addition to any renewal periods provided by this section.\n\nF. Localities that have zone designations are responsible for providing the local incentives specified in their applications, providing timely submission of enterprise zone reports and evaluations as required by regulation, verifying that businesses and properties seeking enterprise zone incentives are physically located within their zones, and implementing an active local enterprise zone program within the context of overall economic development efforts.\n\n2005, cc. 863, 884; 2018, c. 315; 2019, cc. 119, 496; 2024, cc. 631, 686.",

Once an enterprise zone has been designated, the local government may make written application to the Department to amend the zone boundaries in accordance with the requirements of § 59.1-542. Such boundary amendments are subject to Department approval. Any amendment to an enterprise zone that includes the elimination of an area or areas from a zone shall not exceed the maximum size provisions of subsection C of § 59.1-542 and shall be reviewed by the Department with the potential impact on affected businesses and property owners given primary consideration. Local governing bodies may amend their local enterprise zone incentives with the approval of the Department provided that the proposed incentive is equal to or superior to that in the original application or any previous amendment approved by the Department.\n\nB. The Department may redesignate an existing joint enterprise zone consisting of two localities for the purpose of expanding the zone provided (i) all of the local governing bodies of the localities in which the proposed redesignated zone will be located have submitted to the Department resolutions supporting the proposed redesignation and applications for redesignation of the joint enterprise zone and (ii) the area of the locality added to the redesignated zone is contiguous to the existing joint enterprise zone and includes a revenue-sharing district that has experienced the loss of 900 permanent full-time positions within a 12-month period.\n\nC. When a county or city was previously added to an existing enterprise zone to create a joint enterprise zone, the Department shall redesignate the enterprise zone when the term of the joint enterprise zone expires. The duration of the enterprise zone redesignated pursuant to this subsection shall be equal to the length of time the original enterprise zone existed before the county or city was added to create the joint enterprise zone.\n\nD.

      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n\"Base year\" means either of the two calendar years immediately preceding a qualified business firm's first year of grant eligibility, at the choice of the business firm.\n\n\"Federal minimum wage\" means the minimum wage standard as currently defined by the United States Department of Labor in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. Such definition applies to permanent full-time employees paid on an hourly or wage basis. For those permanent full-time employees filling permanent full-time, salaried positions, the minimum wage is defined as the employee's annual salary divided by 52 weeks per year divided by 35 hours per week.\n\n\"Full month\" means the number of days that a permanent full-time position must be filled in order to count in the calculation of the job creation grant amount. A full month is calculated by dividing the total number of days in the calendar year by 12. A full month for the purpose of calculating job creation grants is equivalent to 30.416666 days.\n\n\"Grant eligible position\" means a new permanent full-time position created above the threshold number at an eligible business firm. Positions in retail, personal service or food and beverage service shall not be considered grant eligible positions.\n\n\"Minimum wage\" means the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum wage, whichever is higher. The Department shall determine whichever is higher for the current calendar year as of December 1 of the prior calendar year, and its determination shall be continuously in effect throughout the calendar year, regardless of changes to the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum wage during that year.\n\n\"Permanent full-time position\" means a job of indefinite duration at a business firm located within an enterprise zone requiring the employee to report for work within the enterprise zone; and requiring (i) a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time per week for the entire normal year of the business firm's operation, which \"normal year\" must consist of at least 48 weeks, (ii) a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time per week for the portion of the calendar year in which the employee was initially hired for or transferred to the business firm, or (iii) a minimum of 1,680 hours per year. Such position shall not include (i) seasonal, temporary or contract positions, (ii) a position created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to a business firm located within an enterprise zone, (iii) any position that previously existed in the Commonwealth, or (iv) positions created by a business that is simultaneously closing facilities in other areas of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"Qualified business firm\" means a business firm designated as a qualified business firm by the Department pursuant to § 59.1-542.\n\n\"Report to work\" means that the employee filling a permanent full-time position reports to the business' zone establishment on a regular basis.\n\n\"Subsequent base year\" means the base year for calculating the number of grant eligible positions in a second or subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant period. If a second or subsequent five-year grant period is requested within two years after the previous five-year grant period, the subsequent base year will be the last grant year. The calculation of this subsequent base year employment will be determined by the number of permanent full-time positions in the preceding base year, plus the number of threshold positions, plus the number of grant eligible positions in the final year of the previous grant period. If a business firm applies for subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant periods beyond the two years immediately following the completion of the previous five-year grant period, the business firm shall use one of the two preceding calendar years as the subsequent base year, at the choice of the business firm.\n\n\"Threshold number\" means an increase of four permanent full-time positions over the number of permanent full-time positions in the base year or subsequent base year.\n\n\"Virginia minimum wage\" means the applicable minimum wage as determined pursuant to the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§ 40.1-28.8 et seq.).\n\nB. A business firm shall be eligible to receive enterprise zone job creation grants for any and all years in which the business firm qualifies in the five consecutive calendar years period commencing with the first year of grant eligibility. A business firm may be eligible for subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant periods if it creates new grant eligible positions above the threshold for its subsequent base year.\n\nC. The amount of the grant for which a business firm is eligible shall be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Either (i) $800 per year for up to five consecutive years for each grant eligible position that during such year is paid a minimum of 175 percent of the minimum wage and that is provided with health benefits, or (ii) $500 per year for up to five years for each grant eligible position that during such year is paid less than 175 percent of the minimum wage, but at least 150 percent of the minimum wage, and that is provided with health benefits. In areas with an unemployment rate that is one and one-half times or more the state average, or for businesses that are certified under regulations adopted by the Director of the Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity pursuant to subdivision 8 of § 2.2-1606, the business firm will receive $500 per year for up to five years for each grant eligible position that during such year is paid at least 125 percent of the minimum wage and that is provided with health benefits. Unemployment rates used to determine eligibility for the reduced wage rate threshold shall be based on the most recent annualized unemployment data published by the Virginia Employment Commission. A business firm may receive grants for up to a maximum of 350 grant eligible jobs annually.\n\n2. Positions paying less than 150 percent of the minimum wage or that are not provided with health benefits shall not be eligible for enterprise zone job creation grants.\n\nD. Job creation grants shall be based on a calendar year. The amount of the grant for which a qualified business firm is eligible with respect to any permanent full-time position that is filled for less than a full calendar year shall be prorated based on the number of full months worked.\n\nE. The amount of the job creation grant for which a qualified business firm is eligible in any year shall not include amounts for grant eligible positions in any year other than the preceding calendar year. Job creation grants shall not be available for any calendar year prior to 2005.\n\nF. Permanent full-time positions that have been used to qualify for any other enterprise zone incentive pursuant to the Enterprise Zone Act (former § 59.1-270 et seq.) shall not be eligible for job creation grants and shall not be counted as a part of the minimum threshold of four new positions.\n\nG. Any qualified business firm receiving a major business facility job tax credit pursuant to § 58.1-439 shall not be eligible to receive an enterprise zone job creation grant under this section for any job used to qualify for the major business facility job tax credit.\n\n2005, cc. 863, 884; 2006, c. 668; 2010, c. 328; 2012, c. 445; 2021, Sp.
