The grants under this section shall be paid to a qualified company from the Fund, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, during each such fiscal year, contingent upon the qualified company's meeting the requirements set forth in the memorandum of understanding for the number of new full-time jobs created and maintained and the amount of capital investment made and retained. The first grant installment of $500,000 shall not be awarded until the qualified company has made a capital investment of at least $40,800,000 and has created at least 373 new full-time jobs at the facility.\n\nD.

The application and evidence shall be filed with the Secretary in person, by mail, or as otherwise agreed upon in the memorandum of understanding by no later than April 1 each year reflecting performance in and through the prior calendar year.
