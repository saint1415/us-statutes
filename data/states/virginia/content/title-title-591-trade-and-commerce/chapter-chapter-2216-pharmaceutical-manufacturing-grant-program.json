Grants paid pursuant to this section shall be subject to appropriation by the General Assembly during each such fiscal year and are contingent on a qualified company meeting the requirements set forth in this chapter and the memorandum of understanding for the number of new full-time jobs created and maintained and the amount of capital investment made. The first grant payment of $2.5 million shall not be awarded until a qualified company has made a capital investment of at least $420 million and has created at least 85 new full-time jobs.\n\nC.

A qualified company applying for a grant installment under this section shall provide evidence, satisfactory to the Secretary, of (i) the aggregate number of new full-time jobs created and maintained as of the last day of February in the fiscal year that immediately precedes the fiscal year in which the grant installment is to be paid and (ii) the aggregate amount of capital investment made as of the last day of February in the fiscal year that immediately precedes the fiscal year in which the grant installment is to be paid. The application and evidence shall be filed with the Secretary in person, by mail, or as otherwise agreed upon in a memorandum of understanding no later than June 1 each year reflecting performance through the last day of the prior February. Failure to meet the filing deadline shall result in a deferral of a scheduled grant installment payment set forth in subsection C. For filings by mail, the postmark cancellation shall govern the date of the filing determination.\n\nE. Within 60 days of receiving an application and evidence pursuant to subsection D, the Secretary shall certify to the Comptroller and the qualified company the amount of grants to which such qualified company is entitled for payment. Payment of such grants shall be made by check issued by the State Treasurer on warrant of the Comptroller in the Commonwealth's fiscal year following the submission of an application. The Comptroller shall not draw any warrant to issue checks for grants without a specific appropriation for the same.\n\nF. As a condition of receipt of grants under this section, a qualified company shall make available to the Secretary for inspection, upon request, all documents relevant and applicable to determining whether the qualified company has met the requirements for receipt of a grant as set forth in this section and subject to a memorandum of understanding.
