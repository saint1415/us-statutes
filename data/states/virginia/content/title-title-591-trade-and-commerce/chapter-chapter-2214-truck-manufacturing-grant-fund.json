Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used to pay grants pursuant to this section. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller pursuant to subsection F.\n\nC. A qualified company shall be eligible to receive grants each fiscal year beginning with the Commonwealth's fiscal year starting on July 1, 2020, and ending with the Commonwealth's fiscal year starting on July 1, 2029, unless such timeframe is extended in accordance with a memorandum of understanding.

Within 30 days of receiving an application and evidence pursuant to subsection E, the Secretary shall certify to the Comptroller and the qualified company the amount of grants to which such qualified company is entitled for payment. Payment of such grant shall be made by check issued by the State Treasurer on warrant of the Comptroller by the end of the calendar year of the submission of the application and evidence.
