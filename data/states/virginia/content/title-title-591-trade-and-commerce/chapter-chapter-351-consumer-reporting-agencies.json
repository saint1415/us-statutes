Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.\n\nYou have a right to bring civil action against anyone, including a consumer reporting agency, who improperly obtains access to a file, knowingly or willfully misuses file data, or fails to correct inaccurate file data.\n\nA consumer reporting agency does not have the right to charge you a fee to place a freeze on your credit report.\"\n\nQ.
