Seasonal or temporary positions, and positions created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth shall not qualify as new full-time jobs under this section. Other positions, which may or may not be of indefinite duration, including supplemental employees of affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, contractors, or subcontractors may be considered new full-time jobs, if so designated in the memorandum of understanding between such manufacturer, the Commonwealth, and others as such memorandum of understanding was in effect on November 20, 2007.\n\n\"Qualified manufacturer\" means a manufacturer that (i) is expected to make a capital investment of at least $500 million by June 30, 2023, in an eligible county related to the manufacture of aerospace engines and (ii) is expected to create at least 540 jobs in an eligible county for the manufacture of aerospace engines or activities ancillary or supportive of such manufacture.\n\n\"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Commerce and Trade or his designee.\n\nB. Any qualified manufacturer that, after July 1, 2008, first begins operations in an eligible county shall be eligible to receive a grant each fiscal year beginning with the Commonwealth's fiscal year starting on July 1, 2013, and ending with the Commonwealth's fiscal year starting on July 1, 2022, unless such time frame is extended in accordance with subsection E. The grants under this section (i) shall be paid, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, from a fund entitled the Aerospace Engine Manufacturing Performance Grant Fund, which Fund is hereby established on the books of the Comptroller, (ii) shall not exceed $35 million in the aggregate, and (iii) shall be paid to the qualified manufacturer during each fiscal year contingent upon the qualified manufacturer meeting the requirements for the aggregate (a) number of new full-time jobs created and the substantial retention of the same and (b) amount of the capital investment made and substantially retained as set forth in the memorandum of understanding.\n\nC. If grants to be paid to qualified manufacturers under this section in a fiscal year exceed the aggregate amount available in the Aerospace Engine Manufacturing Performance Grant Fund for that year, each qualified manufacturer's grants for the year shall equal the amount of grants to which the qualified manufacturer would otherwise be eligible multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall equal the aggregate amount available for payment from the Aerospace Engine Manufacturing Performance Grant Fund for that fiscal year, and the denominator shall equal the aggregate dollar amount of grants to which all qualified manufacturers otherwise would be eligible for such fiscal year.\n\nThe aggregate amount of the grants payable under this section shall be subject to the following requirements and limitations:\n\n1. Grants shall be awarded after July 1, 2013, and before July 1, 2023, unless such time frame is extended in accordance with subsection E.\n\n2.

Grants shall be paid based upon such requirements as agreed to on November 20, 2007, regardless if such memorandum of understanding is later modified, amended, superseded, or otherwise changed.\n\n3. The aggregate amount of grants that may be awarded in a particular fiscal year shall not exceed the following:\n\na. $5.5 million for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013;\n\nb. $11 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014;\n\nc. $14 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015;\n\nd. $17 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016;\n\ne. $20 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017;\n\nf. $23 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018;\n\ng. $26 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019;\n\nh. $29 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020;\n\ni. $32 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2021; and\n\nj. $35 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022.\n\n4. Grants provided by this section shall not exceed $35 million in the aggregate.\n\nD. Any qualified manufacturer applying for a grant under this section shall provide evidence, satisfactory to the Secretary, of (i) the aggregate number of new full-time jobs created and the substantial retention of the same throughout the calendar year that immediately precedes the end of the fiscal year in which the grant is to be paid, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the capital investment made and substantially retained as of the last day of the calendar year that immediately precedes the end of the fiscal year in which the grant is to be paid. The application and evidence shall be filed with the Secretary in person or by mail no later than April 1 each year following the calendar year in which the qualified manufacturer meets such aggregate new full-time job requirements and aggregate capital investment. Failure to meet the filing deadline shall result in a deferral of a scheduled grant payment set forth in subsection C. For filings by mail, the postmark cancellation shall govern the date of the filing determination.\n\nE. The memorandum of understanding may provide that if a grant payment has been deferred for any reason, including the initial failure to meet the aggregate capital investment and the aggregate new full-time job requirements set forth in the memorandum of understanding or the occurrence of any substantial reduction in such new full-time job requirements or capital investment requirements after such requirements have been met but before the grant payment has been made, payment in a subsequent fiscal year for which such requirements have been met for the immediately preceding calendar year shall include both the deferred payment and the scheduled grant payment as provided in subsection C.\n\nF. Within 30 days after the filing deadline in subsection D, the Secretary shall certify to (i) the Comptroller and (ii) each qualified manufacturer the amount of the grant to which such qualified manufacturer is entitled under this section for payment in the current fiscal year. Payment of such grant shall be made by check issued by the Treasurer of Virginia on warrant of the Comptroller by June 30 of such fiscal year.\n\nG. As a condition of receipt of a grant, a qualified manufacturer shall make available to the Secretary or his designee for inspection upon his request all relevant and applicable documents to determine whether the qualified manufacturer has met the requirements for the receipt of grants as set forth in this section and subject to the memorandum of understanding. The Comptroller shall not draw any warrants to issue checks for the grant program under this section without a specific appropriation for the same. All such documents appropriately identified by the qualified manufacturer shall be considered confidential and proprietary.\n\n2008, cc. 256, 630.",

Seasonal or temporary positions, and positions created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth shall not qualify as new full-time jobs under this section.\n\n\"Qualified manufacturer\" means the same as such term is defined in § 59.1-284.20.\n\n\"Qualified supplier\" means a manufacturer, assembler, distributor, or service provider on a qualified supplier list that (i) first begins doing business at a location within the Commonwealth or (ii) expands its business at a location within the Commonwealth subsequent to a qualified manufacturer commencing construction of a manufacturing, assembly, and testing facility in an eligible county. A \"qualified supplier\" shall deliver or provide ancillary parts, tools, or other components used by the qualified manufacturer within the Commonwealth or provide ancillary services within the Commonwealth for such qualified manufacturer.

However, no grant shall be paid to the qualified manufacturer unless the qualified supplier cluster (all of which qualified suppliers are on the qualified supplier list) subsequent to the qualified manufacturer commencing construction in an eligible county makes the aggregate capital investment and meets the new full-time job requirements as set forth in this section. The grants under this section (a) shall be paid, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, from a fund entitled the Aerospace Engine Manufacturing Supplier Cluster Grant Fund, which Fund is hereby established on the books of the Comptroller, (b) shall not exceed $5 million in the aggregate, and (c) shall be paid, as provided in this section, to the qualified manufacturer subject to the conditions of this section being met.\n\n2.

If the qualified supplier cluster has, subsequent to the qualified manufacturer commencing construction in an eligible county, (a) created and substantially retained at least 300 new full-time jobs within the Commonwealth, (b) made and substantially retained at least $50 million worth of capital investment within the Commonwealth, and (c) made a written certification to the Secretary that its decision to create such new full-time jobs and make such capital investment was based in part by the location of the qualified manufacturer and was in part for a purpose of providing ancillary parts, tools, or other components used by the qualified manufacturer within the Commonwealth or for providing ancillary services within the Commonwealth for such qualified manufacturer, then an aggregate amount of $5 million in grants shall be paid to the qualified manufacturer as provided in subsection E. In no case, however, shall the aggregate amount of grants payable to all qualified manufacturers pursuant to this section exceed $5 million and in no case shall more than $2.5 million in grants pursuant to this section be paid in a fiscal year. Upon receipt of such written certification by the qualified supplier cluster, the Secretary shall promptly notify the qualified manufacturer of the same for purposes of applying for a grant under this section.\n\nThe memorandum of understanding may provide that a qualified manufacturer shall be eligible for a reduced grant payment if at least 100 new full-time jobs have been created and substantially retained and at least one-third of the full $50 million capital investment has been made and substantially retained by the qualified supplier cluster. As described in the memorandum of understanding, in such case the reduction in the grant payments shall be proportional to the reduction in the new full-time jobs created and substantially retained and the reduction in the capital investment. Further, the memorandum of understanding may provide for deferred grant payments if the capital investment and the new full-time jobs have been met, but a substantial reduction occurs in the capital investment or new full-time job requirements between the date such requirements were met and the date the grant payment is to be made.\n\nC.
