Grants shall be paid based upon such requirements as agreed to on or before August 31, 2011, regardless if such memorandum of understanding is later modified, amended, superseded, or otherwise changed;\n\n2. The aggregate amount of grants that may be awarded in a particular fiscal year shall not exceed the following:\n\na. $5 million for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012;\n\nb. $10 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013;\n\nc. $15 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014;\n\nd. $20 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015; and\n\ne. $25 million, less the total amount of grants previously awarded pursuant to this subsection, for the Commonwealth's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016; and\n\n3.

The application and evidence shall be filed with the Secretary in person or by mail no later than April 1 each year following the calendar year in which the qualified shipbuilder meets such aggregate new full-time job requirements and aggregate capital investments. Failure to meet the filing deadline shall result in a deferral of a scheduled grant payment set forth in subsection B. For filings by mail, the postmark cancellation shall govern the date of the filing determination.\n\nD. The memorandum of understanding may provide that if a grant payment has been deferred for any reason, including the initial failure to meet the aggregate capital investment or the aggregate new full-time job requirements or the aggregate base training expenses set forth in the memorandum of understanding or the occurrence of any substantial reduction in such new full-time job requirements or capital investment requirements after such requirements have been met but before the grant payment has been made, payment in a subsequent fiscal year for which such requirements have been met for the immediately preceding calendar year shall include both the deferred payment and the scheduled grant payment as provided in subsection B or that a proportional payment, based on the proportional share of the required additional full-time jobs, be made.\n\nE. As a condition of receipt of a grant, a qualified shipbuilder shall make available to the Secretary or his designee for inspection upon his request relevant and applicable documents to determine whether the qualified shipbuilder has met the requirements for the receipt of grants as set forth in this section and subject to the memorandum of understanding.

An eligible city shall be eligible to receive a grant from the Advanced Shipbuilding Training Facility Fund established under subsection B each fiscal year beginning with the Commonwealth's fiscal year starting on July 1, 2012. The grants under this subsection may be paid to the eligible city subject to a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary, the eligible city, and the qualified shipbuilder that provides that (i) the eligible city or a private developer will build a new training facility for use by the qualified shipbuilder and the qualified shipbuilder will use the new training facility during the grant period; (ii) the new training facility is part of a development plan approved by the eligible city and the qualified shipbuilder that includes additional private capital investment adjacent to the new training facility that is equal to or greater than the cost of the facility; and (iii) the qualified shipbuilder waives its right to apply for grants under subsection B. Grants to an eligible city may be used only for the construction, lease, or lease-purchase of the new training facility, including related debt service or repayment of any loans whose proceeds are used for such costs. The memorandum of understanding may provide for a total amount of grants under this subsection of not more than $42 million, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, and for a period of eligibility of up to 10 years, unless such time frame is extended in accordance with subsection C or D, and may provide for a contractual agreement for payments by the Commonwealth. At the conclusion of the grant period, the qualified shipbuilder shall have the right to assume ownership of the new training facility.\n\n2009, cc. 798, 850; 2011, c. 749.",
