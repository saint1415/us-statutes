Sealing may be required either by the issuance of a court order following the filing of a petition or automatically by operation of law under the processes set forth in this chapter. \"Sealing\" does not prohibit or limit dissemination of records within or between any department, division, board, bureau, commission, branch, authority, or other agency created by the Commonwealth, or to which the Commonwealth is a party or any political subdivision thereof, or with any federal agency, for the purpose of administering any duties or functions required by state or federal law.\n\nB. The provisions of this chapter shall only apply to adults who were arrested, charged, or convicted of a criminal offense and to juveniles who were tried in circuit court pursuant to § 16.1-269.1.\n\nC.

Any law-enforcement agency shall reply to any inquiry that no record exists with respect to an arrest, charge, or conviction that has been sealed, unless such information is permitted to be disclosed pursuant to § 19.2-392.13 and pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § 9.1-128 and procedures adopted pursuant to § 9.1-134. As provided in subsection B of § 19.2-392.14, a clerk of any court shall reply to any inquiry requesting access to a sealed court record that such court record has been sealed and can only be accessed pursuant to a court order. A clerk of any court and the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court shall be immune from any cause of action arising from the production of sealed court records, including electronic records, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. This subsection shall not be construed to limit, withdraw, or overturn any defense or immunity already existing in statutory or common law or to affect any cause of action accruing prior to the effective date of this section.\n\nD. Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon entry of an order for sealing, the person who was arrested, charged, or convicted of the offense that was ordered to be sealed may deny or not disclose to any state or local government agency or to any private employer in the Commonwealth that such an arrest, charge, or conviction occurred. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person as to whom an order for sealing has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of that person's denial or failure to disclose any information concerning an arrest, charge, or conviction that has been sealed.\n\nE. A person who is the subject of the order of sealing entered pursuant to § 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.8, 19.2-392.11, 19.2-392.12, or 19.2-392.12:1, or the sealing of an offense without the entry of an order pursuant to § 19.2-392.6:1 or 19.2-392.17, may not deny or fail to disclose information to any employer or prospective employer about an offense that has been ordered to be sealed if:\n\n1. The person is applying for full-time employment or part-time employment with, or to be a volunteer with, the State Police or a police department or sheriff's office that is a part of or administered by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof;\n\n2. This Code requires the employer to make such an inquiry;\n\n3. Federal law requires the employer to make such an inquiry;\n\n4. The position, or access to the premises in or upon which any part of the duties of such position is performed or is to be performed, is subject to any requirement imposed in the interest of the national security of the United States under any security program in effect pursuant to or administered under any contract with, or statute or regulation of, the United States or any Executive Order of the President; or\n\n5. The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § 9.1-128 and procedures adopted pursuant to § 9.1-134 allow the employer to access such sealed records.\n\nFailure to disclose such sealed arrest, charge, or conviction, if such failure to disclose was knowing or willful, shall be a ground for prosecution of perjury as provided for in § 18.2-434.\n\nF. An order to seal an arrest, charge, or conviction entered pursuant to § 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.8, 19.2-392.11, 19.2-392.12, or 19.2-392.12:1, or the sealing of an offense without the entry of an order pursuant to § 19.2-392.6:1 or 19.2-392.17, shall not relieve the person who was arrested, charged, or convicted of any obligation to pay all fines, costs, forfeitures, penalties, or restitution in relation to the offense that was ordered to be sealed. Additionally, no order to seal an arrest, charge, or conviction pursuant to § 19.2-392.12 shall be entered unless such person has fully paid his restitution in relation to the offense to be sealed.\n\nG.

A person as to whom an order for sealing has been entered may be required to disclose a sealed arrest, charge, or conviction as part of such proceedings. Failure to disclose such sealed arrest, charge, or conviction, if such failure to disclose was knowing or willful, shall be a ground for prosecution of perjury as provided for in § 18.2-434.\n\nH. Any arrest, charge, or conviction sealed pursuant to § 19.2-392.6:1, 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.8, 19.2-392.11, 19.2-392.12, 19.2-392.12:1, or 19.2-392.17 shall be (i) disclosed in any pretrial or sentencing report, including any discretionary sentencing guidelines; (ii) considered when ascertaining the punishment of a defendant; or (iii) considered in any hearing on the issue of bail, release, or detention of a defendant.\n\nI.

An order to seal a charge or conviction entered pursuant to § 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.12, or 19.2-392.12:1, or the sealing of an offense without the entry of an order pursuant to § 19.2-392.6:1, shall not serve to restore a person's civil rights or a person's right to possess, transport, or carry a firearm, ammunition for a firearm, or a stun weapon.\n\n2021, Sp.

If a pleading or case document in a court record that was sealed is included among other court records that have not been ordered to be sealed, the clerk of the court shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of that record. If an appellate court record contains court records that have been sealed, with or without a court order, and court records that have not been sealed, the clerk of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of such appellate record. Any circuit court shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of any published or unpublished opinion relating to an arrest, charge, or conviction that was ordered to be sealed. The Supreme Court and Court of Appeals shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of any (i) published or unpublished opinion, order, or summary of a case; (ii) court records for matters in which the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction; or (iii) appellate court record of a traffic infraction under Title 46.2 that is not punishable as a criminal offense relating to an arrest, charge, or conviction that was sealed. A clerk of the court shall not be required to redact information pertaining to a court record that has been sealed in any reports or electronic transmissions of case information that are required by statute or prepared and distributed to a state or local government entity in the normal course of business. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize a business screening service to allow dissemination of a sealed record due to its continued existence in any appellate record.\n\nG.

For the purposes of this subsection, the primary case file includes the indictment or warrant and any other papers relating to any proceedings on such indictment or warrant. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize a business screening service to allow dissemination of a sealed record due to its continued existence in any such record.\n\nH. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall not seal any conviction or any charge that was deferred and dismissed after a finding of facts sufficient to justify a finding of guilt (i) in violation of federal regulatory record retention requirements or (ii) in violation of federal program requirements if the Department of Motor Vehicles is required to suspend a person's driving privileges as a result of a conviction or deferral and dismissal ordered to be sealed. Upon receipt of an electronic notification of an order directing that an offense be sealed, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall seal all records if the federal regulatory record retention period has run and all federal program requirements associated with a suspension have been satisfied. However, if the Department of Motor Vehicles cannot seal an offense pursuant to this subsection at the time it is ordered, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall (a) notify the Department of State Police of the reason the record cannot be sealed and cite the authority prohibiting sealing at the time it is ordered; (b) notify the Department of State Police of the date, if known at the time when the sealing is ordered, on which such record can be sealed; (c) seal such record on that date; and (d) notify the Department of State Police when such record has been sealed within the Department of Motor Vehicles' records.\n\nI. The Library of Virginia shall not be required to seal any court records in its possession, provided that such records are not accessible or disseminated to the public.\n\nJ. No arrest, charge, or conviction that has been sealed may be used to impeach the credibility of a testifying witness at any hearing or trial unless (i) its probative value, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect and (ii) the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to use it so that the party has a fair opportunity to contest its use.\n\nK. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of sealed criminal history record information or any information from such records among law-enforcement officers and attorneys when such disclosures are made by such officers or attorneys while engaged in the performance of their duties for purposes solely relating to the disclosure or use of exculpatory, mitigating, and impeachment evidence or between attorneys for the Commonwealth when related to the prosecution of a separate crime.\n\n2021, Sp.

If a business screening service knows that a criminal history record or a traffic history record is a sealed record or a sealed possession of marijuana record, regardless of the source of the record, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record.\n\nC. A business screening service shall register with the Department of State Police to electronically receive notifications of orders of sealing provided to the Department of State Police pursuant to §§ 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.8, 19.2-392.10, 19.2-392.11, 19.2-392.12, and 19.2-392.12:1. The Department of State Police may charge an annual licensing fee to the business screening service for accessing such information, with such fee to be used to cover the cost of providing such records. The contract between the Department of State Police and the business screening service shall prohibit dissemination of the electronic notifications of the orders of sealing and shall require compliance by the business screening service with the provisions of subsections D, E, and F. The electronic notifications of the orders of sealing received by the business screening service and all information contained therein shall remain confidential and shall not be disseminated or resold. The electronic notifications of the orders of sealing shall be used for the sole purpose of deleting criminal history records that have been sealed. The business screening service shall delete the electronic notifications of the orders of sealing after deleting the information contained in such orders from sealed records. The Department of State Police shall require that the business screening service seeking access to the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. The Department of State Police shall further require that a business screening service acknowledge receipt of all electronic notifications of the orders of sealing provided by the Department of State Police. The Department of State Police shall maintain and publicly post a list on its website identifying the business screening services that are licensed to receive such records.\n\nD. A business screening service that disseminates a criminal history record or a traffic history record on or after the effective date of this section shall include the date when the record was collected by the business screening service and a notice that the information may include records that have been sealed since that date.\n\nE. A business screening service shall implement and follow reasonable procedures to assure that it does not maintain or sell criminal history records or traffic history records that are inaccurate or incomplete. If the completeness or accuracy of a criminal history record or traffic history record maintained by a business screening service is disputed by the individual who is the subject of the record, the business screening service shall, without charge, investigate the disputed record. If, upon investigation, the business screening service determines that the record does not accurately reflect the content of the official record, the business screening service shall correct the disputed record so as to accurately reflect the content of the official record. If the disputed record is found to have been sealed pursuant to § 19.2-392.6:1, 19.2-392.7, 19.2-392.8, 19.2-392.10, 19.2-392.11, 19.2-392.12, 19.2-392.12:1, or 19.2-392.17, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record. A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the business screening service reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, which may be based on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous, the business screening service shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons why it has determined that the dispute is frivolous and shall provide a description of any information required to investigate the disputed record. The business screening service shall notify the subject of the disputed record of the correction or deletion of the record or of the termination or completion of the investigation related to the record within 30 days of the date when the business screening service receives notice of the dispute from the subject of the record.\n\nF. A business screening service shall implement procedures for individuals to submit a request to obtain their own criminal history record and traffic history record information maintained by the business screening service and any other information that may be sold to another entity by the business screening service regarding the individual.\n\nG. A business screening service that violates this section is liable to the person who is the subject of the criminal history record or traffic history record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney fees. Within 10 days of service of any suit by an individual, the business screening service may make a cure offer in writing to the individual claiming to have suffered a loss as a result of a violation of this section. Such offer shall be in writing and include one or more things of value, including the payment of money. A cure offer shall be reasonably calculated to remedy a loss claimed by the individual, as well as any attorney fees or other fees, expenses, or other costs of any kind that such individual may incur in relation to such loss. No cure offer shall be admissible in any proceeding initiated under this section, unless the cure offer is delivered by the business screening service to the individual claiming loss or to any attorney representing such individual prior to the filing of the business screening service's initial responsive pleading in such proceeding. The business screening service shall not be liable for such individual's attorney fees and court costs incurred following delivery of the cure offer unless the actual damages found to have been sustained and awarded, without consideration of attorney fees and court costs, exceed the value of the cure offer.\n\nH. The Attorney General may file a civil action to enforce this section. If the court finds that a business screening service has willfully engaged in an act or practice in violation of this section, the Attorney General may recover for the Literary Fund, upon petition to the court, a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation. For the purposes of this section, prima facie evidence of a willful violation may be shown when the Attorney General notifies the alleged violator by certified mail that an act or practice is a violation of this section and the alleged violator, after receipt of said notice, continues to engage in the act or practice. In any civil action pursuant to this subsection, in addition to any civil penalty awarded, the Attorney General may also recover any costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the state in investigating and preparing the case, not to exceed $1,000 per violation, and attorney fees. Such additional costs and expenses shall be paid into the general fund of the Commonwealth.\n\nI. A business screening service that disseminates criminal history records or traffic history records in the Commonwealth is deemed to have consented to service of process in the Commonwealth and to the jurisdiction of courts of the Commonwealth for actions involving a violation of this section or for the recovery of remedies under this section.\n\nJ. A business screening service that is a consumer reporting agency and that is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6801 et seq., is considered to be in compliance with the comparable provisions of this section. A business screening service is subject to the state remedies under this section if its actions would violate this section and federal law.\n\nK. Any business screening service or person who engages in the conduct of a business screening service, as set forth this this section, that fails to register with the Department of State Police as required by subsection C and that disseminates criminal history records or traffic history records in the Commonwealth may be subject to (i) suit by any person injured by such dissemination and (ii) enforcement actions by the Attorney General as set forth in subsection H.\n\nL.
