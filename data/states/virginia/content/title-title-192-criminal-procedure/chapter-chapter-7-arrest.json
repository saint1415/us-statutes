The warrant shall (i) be directed to an appropriate officer or officers, (ii) name the accused or, if his name is unknown, set forth a description by which he can be identified with reasonable certainty, (iii) describe the offense charged with reasonable certainty, (iv) command that the accused be arrested and brought before a court of appropriate jurisdiction in the county, city or town in which the offense was allegedly committed, and (v) be signed by the issuing officer. If a warrant is issued for an offense in violation of any county, city, or town ordinance that is similar to any provision of this Code, the warrant shall reference the offense using both the citation corresponding to the county, city, or town ordinance and the specific provision of this Code.
