Shares and share certificates in any credit union lawfully authorized to do business in the Commonwealth whose accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or the Virginia Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation, provided no such fiduciary shall invest in such shares an amount from any one fund in his or its care which shall be in excess of such amount as shall be fully insured as an account in such credit union by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or the Virginia Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation.\n\nB. Whenever under the terms of this section the par value of a preference stock is required to be used in a computation, there shall be used instead of such par value the liquidating value of such preference stock in the case of involuntary liquidation, as prescribed by the terms of its issue, in the event that such liquidating value shall be greater than the par value of such preference stock; or in the event that the preference stock in question has no par value, then such liquidating value shall be used instead; or when such preference stock shall be one of no par value and one for which no such liquidating value shall have been so prescribed, then for the purposes of such computation the preference stock in question shall be deemed to have a value of $100 per share.\n\nC. When any security provided for in this section is purchased by a fiduciary and at the time of such purchase the statement for the preceding fiscal year of the corporation issuing the security so being purchased has not been published and is therefore not available, the statement of such corporation for the fiscal year immediately prior to such preceding fiscal year shall be considered the statement for such preceding fiscal year and shall have the same force and effect as the statement for the fiscal year preceding such purchase, provided the date of such purchase is not more than four months after the end of the last fiscal year of the corporation.\n\nD. In testing a new issue of securities under the provisions of this section, it shall be permissible, in determining the number of times that fixed charges or preferred dividend requirements have been earned, to use pro forma fixed charges or dividend requirements, provided the corporation or its corporate predecessor has been in existence for a period of not less than seven years.\n\nE. Investments made under the provisions of this section, if in conformity with the requirements of this section at the time such investments were made, may be retained even though they cease to be eligible for purchase under the provisions of this section, but shall be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (§ 64.2-780 et seq.).\n\n2012, c. 614.",
