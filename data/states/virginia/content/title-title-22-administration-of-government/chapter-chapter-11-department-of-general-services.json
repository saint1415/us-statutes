Each department, agency and institution shall submit to the Department a land use plan for state-owned property it possesses or has under its control showing present and planned uses of such property. Such plan shall be approved by the cognizant board or governing body of the department, agency or institution holding title to or otherwise controlling the state-owned property or the agency head in the absence of a board or governing body, with a recommendation on whether any property should be declared surplus by the department, agency or institution. Development of such land use plans shall be based on guidelines promulgated by the Department. The guidelines shall provide that each land use plan shall be updated and copies provided to the Department by September 1 of each year. The Department may exempt properties that are held and used for conservation purposes from the requirements of this section. The Department shall review the land use plans, the records and inventory required pursuant to subsections B and C of § 2.2-1136 and such other information as may be necessary and determine whether the property or any portion thereof should be declared surplus to the needs of the Commonwealth. By October 1 of each year, the Department shall provide a report to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations setting forth the Department's findings, the sale or marketing of properties identified pursuant to this section, and recommending any actions that may be required by the Governor and the General Assembly to identify and dispose of property not being efficiently and effectively utilized. The Department shall provide a listing of surplus properties on the Department's website. The description of surplus property shall include parcel identification consistent with national spatial data standards in addition to a street address.\n\nUntil permanent disposition of the property determined to be surplus is effected, the property shall continue to be maintained by the department, agency or institution possessing or controlling it, unless upon the recommendation of the Department, the Governor authorizes the transfer of the property to the possession or control of the Department.

The General Assembly shall also approve the disposal or transfer.\n\n2. Surplus real property valued at less than $5 million that is possessed and controlled by a public institution of higher education may be sold by such institution, provided that (i) at least 45 days prior to executing a contract for the sale of such property, the institution gives written notification to the Governor and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations; and (ii) the Governor may postpone the sale at any time up to 10 days prior to the proposed date of sale. Such sale may be effected by public auction, sealed bids, or by marketing through one or more Virginia licensed real estate brokers after satisfying the public notice provisions of subsection D of § 2.2-1156. The terms of all negotiations resulting in such sale shall be public information. The public institution of higher education may retain the proceeds from the sale of such property if the property was acquired by nongeneral funds.

After it determines the property to be surplus to the needs of the Commonwealth and that such property should be sold, the Department shall request the written opinion of the Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources as to whether the property is a significant component of the Commonwealth's natural or historic resources, and if so how those resources should be protected in the sale of the property. The Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources shall provide this review within 15 business days of receipt of full information from the Department.\n\nC. Upon receipt of the Secretary's review under subsection B and prior to offering the surplus property for sale to the public, the Department shall notify the chief administrative officer of the locality within which the property is located as well as any economic development entity for such locality of the pending disposition of such property. The chief administrative officer or local economic development entity shall have up to 180 days from the date of such notification to submit a proposal to the Department for the use by the locality or the local economic development entity of such property in conjunction with a bona fide economic development activity. The Department shall review such proposal, and if the Department determines that such proposal is viable and could benefit the Commonwealth, the Department may negotiate with the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of such property to the locality or economic development entity. If no agreement is reached between the Department and the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of the property, or if no proposal for the use of the property is submitted to the Department by the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity within 180 days of notification of the pending disposition of the property, the Department, with the prior, written approval of the Governor, may proceed to dispose of the property as provided in this section.\n\nD. If the surplus property is not disposed of pursuant to subsection C, the sale shall be by public auction, or sealed bids, or by marketing through one or more real estate brokers licensed by the Commonwealth. Notice of the date, time and place of sale, if by public auction or sealed bids shall be given by advertisement in at least one newspaper published and having general circulation in the county or city in which the property to be sold is located and be posted on the Department's website. At least 30 days shall elapse between publication of the notice and the auction or the date on which sealed bids will be opened.\n\nE. The Department may reject any and all bids or offers when, in the opinion of the Department, the price is inadequate in relation to the value of the property, the proposed terms are unacceptable, or if a need has been found for the property.\n\nF. In lieu of the sale of any such property, or in the event the Department determines there is space within a building owned by the Commonwealth or any space leased by the Commonwealth in excess of current and reasonably anticipated needs, the Department may, with the approval of the Governor, lease or sublease such property or space to any responsible person, firm or corporation on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided, however, that the authority herein to sublease space leased by the Commonwealth shall be subject to the terms of the original lease. The Department may with the approval of the Governor permit charitable organizations exempt from taxation under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that provide addiction recovery services to lease or sublease such property or space at cost and on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided such use is deemed appropriate.\n\nThe Department shall post reports from the Commonwealth's statewide electronic procurement system, known as eVA, on the Department's website. The report shall include, at a minimum, current leasing opportunities and sales of surplus real property posted on the eVA's Virginia Business Opportunities website. Such reports shall also be made available by electronic subscription. The provisions of this section requiring disposition of property through the medium of sealed bids, public auction, or marketing through licensed real estate brokers shall not apply to any lease thereof, although such procedures may be followed in the discretion of the Department.\n\nG. The deed, lease, or sublease conveying the property or excess space shall be executed in the name of the Commonwealth and shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and notwithstanding how title to the property was acquired, the deed or lease may be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Director of the Department or his designee, and such action shall not create a cloud on the title to the property.\n\nIn the event that the Department determines that a boundary line of a surplus property requires adjustment, the Department may work with the adjacent landowner to adjust the boundary line and to transfer property to, or acquire property from, such adjacent landowner. In the event the Department determines that granting or accepting an easement over surplus property or the property of the adjacent landowner would facilitate the transfer of the surplus property, the Department may enter into any such easement on behalf of the department, agency, or institution in possession or control of the property, provided, however, that any such easement shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General and subject to the written approval of the Governor. The terms of the sale, lease, or sublease shall be subject to the written approval of the Governor.\n\nH. An exception to sale by sealed bids, public auction, or listing the property with a licensed real estate broker may be granted by the Governor if the property is landlocked and inaccessible from a public road or highway. In such cases, the Department shall notify all adjacent landowners of the Commonwealth's desire to dispose of the property. After the notice has been given, the Department may begin negotiations for the sale of the property with each interested adjacent landowner. The Department, with the approval of the Governor, may accept any offer that it deems to be fair and adequate consideration for the property. In all cases, the offer shall be the best offer made by any adjacent landowner. The terms of all negotiations shall be public information.\n\nI. Subject to any law to the contrary, 50 percent of the proceeds from all sales or leases, or from the conveyance of any interest in property under the provisions of this article, above the costs of the transaction, which costs shall include fees or commissions, if any, negotiated with and paid to auctioneers or real estate brokers, shall be paid into the State Park Acquisition and Development Fund, so long as the sales or leases pertain to general fund agencies or the property involved was originally acquired through the general fund, except as provided in Chapter 180 of the Acts of Assembly of 1966. The remaining 50 percent of proceeds involving general fund sales or leases, less a pro rata share of any costs of the transactions, shall be deposited in the general fund of the state treasury. The Department of Planning and Budget shall develop guidelines that allow, with the approval of the Governor, any portion of the deposit in the general fund to be credited to the agency, department or institution having control of the property at the time it was determined surplus to the Commonwealth's needs. Any amounts so credited to an agency, department or institution may be used, upon appropriation, to supplement maintenance reserve funds or capital project appropriations, or for the acquisition, construction or improvement of real property or facilities. Net proceeds from sales or leases of special fund agency properties or property acquired through a gift for a specific purpose shall be retained by the agency or used in accordance with the original terms of the gift. Notwithstanding the foregoing, income from leases or subleases above the cost of the transaction shall first be applied to rent under the original lease and to the cost of maintenance and operation of the property. The remaining funds shall be distributed as provided herein.\n\nJ.

      "text": "A. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage and promote the use of cost-effective vehicles by considering the total cost of ownership by agencies of the Commonwealth.\n\nB. By October 1, 2022, the Department shall identify a publicly available total cost of ownership calculator that will be used to assess and compare the total cost to purchase, own, lease, and operate light-duty internal combustion-engine vehicles (ICEVs) versus comparable electric vehicles (EVs). Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Department and all agencies of the Commonwealth shall utilize the calculator prior to purchasing or leasing any light-duty vehicles and shall purchase or lease an EV unless the calculator clearly indicates that purchasing or leasing an ICEV has a lower cost of ownership.\n\n1. The calculator shall, at a minimum, account for the vehicle's make, model, and age; the average miles traveled per year for similarly used vehicles; the expected life expectancy of the vehicle and average annual depreciation; the upfront and annual costs of purchasing such vehicle and all other costs of vehicle ownership or lease; and all costs the agency must incur to add chargers or other fueling facilities to support such vehicles. The calculator shall be updated at least annually to account for updates in information, including information on the latest light-duty vehicle models available.\n\n2. The Department shall make the calculator available to all state and local public bodies and transit agencies. The Department shall also provide technical assistance to such public bodies utilizing the calculator upon request.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, \"light-duty vehicle\" means a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of 14,000 pounds or less.\n\nC. Beginning January 1, 2026, and every three years thereafter, the Department shall submit to the Governor and the General Assembly a report summarizing the Department's vehicle procurements and the vehicle procurements of other agencies of the Commonwealth. The report shall, at a minimum, include a compilation of types of vehicles by size, fuel sources, and the total estimated cost savings and avoided emissions attributable to purchasing or leasing of EVs instead of ICEVs.\n\nD. Emergency vehicles, as defined in § 46.2-920, and any vehicles used by an agency of the Commonwealth in law-enforcement, incident response, or other emergency response activities shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. The Department may authorize other exemptions from the requirements of this section upon finding that an EV is not a practicable alternative to an ICEV for a particular use, or for some other compelling reason.\n\nE. The Department shall develop guidance documents regarding the procedure for requesting exemptions from the requirements of this section and the criteria for evaluating such exemption requests. Before adopting or revising such guidance documents, the Department shall publish the document on its website and provide a 30-day period for public review and comment.\n\nF. The Department may issue any directives or guidance documents or promulgate any regulations as may be necessary to implement the requirements of this section.\n\n2022, c. 789.",
