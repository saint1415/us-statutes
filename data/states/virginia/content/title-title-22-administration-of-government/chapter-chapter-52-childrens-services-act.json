State pool funds for transitional services shall be allocated for no longer than 12 months. Local agencies may contract with a private school education program provider to provide transitional services in the public school.\n\nC. The General Assembly and the governing body of each county and city shall annually appropriate such sums of money as shall be sufficient to (i) provide special education services and foster care services for children and youth identified in subdivisions B 1 through 4 and 6 and 7 and (ii) meet relevant federal mandates for the provision of these services. The community policy and management team shall anticipate to the best of its ability the number of children and youth for whom such services will be required. Nothing in this section shall prohibit local governments from requiring parental or legal financial contributions, where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law or regulation, utilizing a standard sliding fee scale based upon ability to pay, as provided in the appropriation act.\n\nD. Referral of a child and family to a family assessment and planning team, recommendation by that team of the proper level of treatment and services needed for the child and family, and determination by the team of the child's eligibility for funding for services through the state pool of funds shall satisfy the fiscal responsibility of the community services board, local school division, local department of social services, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice with regard to services funded through the pool. However, the community services board, local school division, local department of social services, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice shall continue to be responsible for providing services identified in an individual family service plan that are within the agency's scope of responsibility and funded separately from the state pool.\n\nIn any instance that local department of social services places an individual who is (i) 18 through 21 years of age, inclusive; (ii) eligible for funding from the state pool; and (iii) properly defined as a school-age child with disabilities pursuant to § 22.1-213 across jurisdictional lines in an approved foster care placement in the Commonwealth and the individual's individualized education program (IEP), as prepared by the local educational authority in the jurisdiction where the individual resides, indicates that a private day school placement is the appropriate educational program for such individual, the financial and legal responsibility for the individual's special education services and IEP shall remain with the placing jurisdiction until the individual reaches the age of 21, inclusive, or is no longer eligible for special education services, in compliance with the provisions of federal law, Article 2 (§ 22.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1, and Board of Education regulations.\n\nE. In any matter properly before a court for which state pool funds are to be accessed, the court shall, prior to final disposition, and pursuant to §§ 2.2-5209 and 2.2-5212, refer the matter to the community policy and management team for assessment by a local family assessment and planning team authorized by policies of the community policy and management team for assessment to determine the recommended level of treatment and services needed by the child and family. The family assessment and planning team making the assessment shall make a report of the case or forward a copy of the individual family services plan to the court within 30 days of the court's written referral to the community policy and management team. The court shall consider the recommendations of the family assessment and planning team and the community policy and management team. If, prior to a final disposition by the court, the court requests a level of service not identified or recommended in the report submitted by the family assessment and planning team, the court shall ask the community policy and management team to submit a second report characterizing comparable levels of service to the requested level of service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the court may make any disposition as is authorized or required by law. Services ordered pursuant to a disposition rendered by the court pursuant to this section shall qualify for funding as appropriated under this section.\n\nF.
