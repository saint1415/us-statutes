Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any general or special law of the Commonwealth, each state agency, institution, board, or authority that has been authorized to issue or incur or have outstanding tax-supported debt at one time or from time to time up to a specific principal amount or aggregate principal amount, shall in determining compliance with such authorization treat as principal the amount of any net original issue premium in excess of a de minimis amount received from the issuance or incurrence of such tax-supported debt.\n\nC. The provisions of this section shall not apply to refunding tax-supported debt, which, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, may be issued or incurred with or without original issue premium in a principal amount up to the amount necessary to pay at maturity or redeem the tax-supported debt to be refunded and pay all issuance costs and other financing expenses of the refunding.\n\nD.
