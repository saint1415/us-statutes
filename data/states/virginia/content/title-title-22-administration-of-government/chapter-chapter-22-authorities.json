The Board shall develop and adopt personnel rules, policies, and procedures to give its employees grievance rights, ensure that employment decisions shall be based upon the merit and fitness of applicants, and prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.\n\nB. Any employee of the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority who is a member of any plan providing health insurance coverage pursuant to Chapter 28 (§ 2.2-2800 et seq.) shall continue to be a member of such health insurance plan under the same terms and conditions. Notwithstanding subsection A of § 2.2-2818, the costs of providing health insurance coverage to such employees who elect to continue to be members of the state employees' health insurance plan shall be paid by the Authority. Alternatively, an employee may elect to become a member of any health insurance plan established by the Authority. The Authority is authorized to (i) establish a health insurance plan for the benefit of its employees and (ii) enter into agreements with the Department of Human Resource Management providing for the coverage of its employees under the state employees' health insurance plan, provided that such agreements require the Authority to pay the costs of providing health insurance coverage under such plan.\n\nC. Any retired employee of the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority shall be eligible to receive the health insurance credit set forth in § 51.1-1400, provided the retired employee meets the eligibility criteria set forth in that section.\n\nD. The Authority is hereby authorized to establish one or more retirement plans for the benefit of its employees (the Authority retirement plan). For purposes of such plans, the provisions of § 51.1-126.4 shall apply, mutatis mutandis. Any Authority employee who is a member of the Virginia Retirement System or other retirement plan as authorized by Article 4 (§ 51.1-125 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 51.1 (the statutory optional retirement plan) at the time the Authority retirement plan becomes effective shall continue to be a member of the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan under the same terms and conditions, unless such employee elects to become a member of the Authority retirement plan. For purposes of this subsection, the \"Virginia Retirement System\" shall include any hybrid retirement program established under Title 51.1.\n\nThe following rules shall apply:\n\n1. The Authority shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions to the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan for retirement and group life insurance in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (§ 51.1-124.1 et seq.) of Title 51.1 for any employee who elects to remain a member of the Virginia Retirement System or a statutory optional retirement plan.\n\n2. Employees who elect to become members of the Authority retirement plan shall be given full credit for their creditable service as defined in § 51.1-124.3 and vesting and benefit accrual under the Authority retirement plan. For any such employee, employment with the Authority shall be treated as employment with any nonparticipating employer for purposes of the Virginia Retirement System or any statutory optional retirement plan.\n\n3. For employees who elect to become members of the Authority retirement plan, the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan, as applicable, shall transfer to the Authority retirement plan assets equal to the actuarially determined present value of the accrued basic benefits for such employees as of the transfer date. For purposes hereof, \"basic benefits\" means the benefits accrued under the Virginia Retirement System or under the statutory optional retirement plan based on creditable service and average final compensation as defined in § 51.1-124.3. The actuarial present value shall be determined by using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used in determining the funding needs of the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan so that the transfer of assets to the Authority retirement plan will have no effect on the funded status and financial stability of the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan. The Authority shall reimburse the Virginia Retirement System for the cost of actuarial services necessary to determine the present value of the accrued basic benefit of employees who transfer to an Authority retirement plan.\n\n4. The Authority may provide that employees of the Authority who are eligible to participate in any deferred compensation plan sponsored by the Authority shall be enrolled automatically in such plan, unless such employee elects, in a manner prescribed by the Board of the Authority, not to participate. The amount of the deferral under the automatic enrollment and the group of employees to which the automatic enrollment shall apply shall be set by the Board, provided, however, that such employees are provided the opportunity to increase or decrease the amount of the deferral in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\nE. The Authority is hereby authorized to establish a plan providing short-term disability and long-term disability benefits for its employees.\n\n2012, cc. 779, 817; 2020, c. 1137.",

The funds of the trust or similar arrangement shall be deemed separate and independent trust funds, shall be segregated from all other funds of the Authority, and shall be invested and administered solely in the interests of the active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) entitled to postemployment benefits other than pensions.\n\nB. The Authority may make appropriations to any such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the Authority may require active and former employees covered by a postemployment benefit program to contribute to the trust or equivalent arrangement through payments or deductions from their wages, salaries, or pensions.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to inhibit the Authority's right to revise or discontinue its plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for its active and former officers and employees as it may deem necessary. If all plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement is established are repealed or terminated by the Authority, then there shall be no continuing responsibility of the Authority to continue to make appropriations to such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the assets of such trust or equivalent arrangement shall be used to provide any benefits continuing to be due to active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) under such plans or programs. If there are no active or former employees (or dependents or beneficiaries) due a benefit under any plan or program providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement was established, then any remaining assets may revert to the Authority.\n\nD. Postemployment benefits other than pensions shall be defined by the Authority pursuant to applicable accounting standards and law. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, hearing, life, or accident insurance (not provided through a pension plan), long-term care benefits, and long-term disability benefits (not covered under a pension plan) provided to individuals who have terminated their service and to the dependents of such individuals, and may be provided by purchasing insurance, by a program of self-insurance, or by a combination of both. However, postemployment benefits other than pensions shall not include defined benefit pension plans for retirees and eligible dependents of retirees, termination benefits, or other pension benefits. Such postemployment benefits other than pensions may be provided to the officers and employees or to their dependents, estates, or designated beneficiaries. Any benefits arising from any postemployment benefits other than pension programs shall be clearly defined and strictly construed.\n\nE. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the moneys and other property comprising the trust or equivalent arrangement established hereunder shall be invested, reinvested, and managed by the Authority or the trust company or bank having powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth that is selected by the Board to act as a trustee for the trust or equivalent arrangement with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with the same aims. Such investments shall be diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. Such investments shall not be limited by Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et seq.).\n\n2012, cc. 779, 817.",

      "text": "A. For purposes of this section:\n\n\"Eligible site\" means a site that meets the qualifications for a site development grant pursuant to § 2.2-2240.2:1, including sites located in Region 1 or 2 that meet the requirements of such section.\n\n\"Program\" means the Virginia Business Ready Expedited Permitting Program.\n\n\"Project\" means an economic development project by a traded-sector company involving significant capital investment and new job creation in the locality in which the project is located.\n\n\"Traded-sector company\" means a company that directly or indirectly derives more than 50 percent of its revenue from out-of-state sources.\n\nB. There is hereby created the Virginia Business Ready Expedited Permitting Program to accomplish the objectives described in this section. The Authority shall annually designate up to two eligible sites and four projects for participation in the Program. Sites and projects eligible for the Program shall include only (i) eligible sites or (ii) projects with significant local, regional, or statewide economic impact that the governing body of the locality in which the project is located has either (a) approved following a public meeting or hearing or (b) submitted, by resolution, for consideration to be included in the Program. No more than two eligible sites or projects shall be designated as part of the Program within one locality annually. Where possible, eligible sites or projects designated by the Authority for participation in the Program shall be equitably distributed geographically throughout the Commonwealth.\n\nC. For any eligible site or project designated by the Authority for participation in the Program, the Authority shall complete a review process within 45 days of such designation. Such review process shall (i) reduce permitting conflicts by providing guidance regarding the permits needed from each agency or governmental entity and steps the applicant can take to expedite permit application review and (ii) provide guidance regarding site planning and development, site suitability and limitations, and facility design. For projects requiring multiple agency permits, the Authority may designate one agency as the lead agency to coordinate the overall permit reviews for the project.\n\nD. For any complete application for a permit or request for approval associated with an eligible site or project designated by the Authority as part of the Program and submitted to a local governmental entity or state agency, whether or not independent, such agency or other entity shall render a decision on the application within 180 days. However, after consultation with the Authority, an applicant and the relevant agency or governmental entity may agree, by memorandum of understanding, to authorize a timeline for rendering decisions that exceeds 180 days. If an agency or other entity requires additional information or documentation from an applicant, including information to render the application or request complete, the agency or other entity shall notify the applicant within 60 days of receipt of the permit application or request for approval. Upon receipt of such request for additional information, an applicant shall respond to the agency or other entity with the required information or documentation within 45 days. If the applicant exceeds the 45-day response timeline, then the 180-day timeline governing an agency or other entity for approval decisions shall be extended by the same number of days by which the 45-day response timeline was exceeded. If the applicant does not provide the additionally requested information within 135 days of the request, the applicant will be deemed noncompliant and shall no longer be designated as participating in the Program, and the Authority may designate an alternative site or project to participate in the Program in its place. If an agency or other governmental entity requires an approval or affirmative action from (i) a federal entity or (ii) an agency or other public or private entity over which the agency or other governmental entity does not exercise control, before a decision can be rendered, then the 180-day timeline shall be extended by the number of days during which a decision on such approval or affirmative action is pending.\n\nE. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or eliminate any legally required opportunities for public comment or input related to a requested permit or approval. If any such public comment or input would require the permitting or approval process to extend beyond 180 days, the 180-day timeline shall be extended by the number of days necessary to provide the full public comment or input period required by law.\n\nF. All local government entities and state agencies, whether or not independent, shall cooperate with the Authority in carrying out the provisions of this section.\n\nG. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership Authority shall report annually by December 1 to the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations and the House Committee on Appropriations on the progress of the Virginia Business Ready Expedited Permitting Program (the Program) established pursuant to this act for the duration of the Program.\n\n2024, cc. 501, 471.",

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, is less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional projects.\n\nPrior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery.

The funds made available in the appropriations act for the Marketing Fund shall be administered and managed by the Authority.\n\nB. In the event more than one person seeks to take advantage of the benefits conferred by this section and the Marketing Fund is insufficient to accommodate all such requests, the matching formula shall be adjusted, to the extent practicable, to afford each request for which there is a valid public purpose an equitable share.\n\nC. All persons seeking to receive or qualify for such matching funds shall apply to the Authority in January of the year preceding the fiscal year for which funds are sought, and to the extent the Governor concurs in such funding request, it shall be reflected in the Governor's Budget Bill filed pursuant to § 2.2-1509. The application shall set forth the applicant's proposals in detail. The Authority shall develop guidelines setting forth the criteria it will weigh in considering such applications; such guidelines may indicate a preference for proposals submitted by nonprofit organizations or state agencies. The guidelines may require that as a condition of receiving any grant or other incentive that is based on employment goals, a recipient company must provide copies of employer quarterly payroll reports provided to the Virginia Employment Commission to verify the employment status of any position included in the employment goal.\n\n1999, cc. 852, 881, § 2.1-548.60; 2001, c. 844; 2002, c. 442; 2013, c. 547; 2017, cc. 69, 267.",

      "text": "A. This article shall be known and may be cited as the Fort Monroe Authority Act.\n\nB. The General Assembly finds and declares that:\n\n1. Fort Monroe, located on a barrier spit at Hampton Roads Harbor and the southern end of Chesapeake Bay where the Old Point Comfort lighthouse has been welcoming ships since 1802, is one of the Commonwealth's most important cultural treasures. Strategically located near Virginia's Historic Triangle of Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown, the 565-acre site has been designated a National Historic Landmark District;\n\n2. As a result of decisions made by the federal Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (known as the BRAC Commission), Fort Monroe will cease to be an army base in 2011, and at that time most of the site will revert to the Commonwealth;\n\n3. The planning phase of Fort Monroe's transition from use as a United States Army base was managed by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority (FMFADA), originally established by the City of Hampton pursuant to legislation enacted by the General Assembly in 2007. The Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, a partnership between the City and the Commonwealth, has fulfilled its primary purpose of formulating a reuse plan for Fort Monroe;\n\n4. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to protect the historic resources at Fort Monroe, provide public access to the Fort's historic resources and recreational opportunities, exercise exemplary stewardship of the Fort's natural resources, and maintain Fort Monroe in perpetuity as a place that is a desirable one in which to reside, do business, and visit, all in a way that is economically sustainable;\n\n5. Fort Monroe's status is unique. Municipal services will need to be provided to Fort Monroe's visitors, residents, and businesses. Both the Commonwealth and the FMFADA are signatories to a Programmatic Agreement under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires several specific actions be taken, including the enforcement of design standards to be adopted by the FMFADA or its successor to govern any new development or building restoration or renovation at Fort Monroe. There exists a need for an entity that can manage the property for the Commonwealth and ensure adherence to the findings, declarations, and policies set forth in this section; and\n\n6. The creation of an authority for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose, and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience, and prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth.\n\nC. The Fort Monroe Authority is created, with the duties and powers set forth in this article, as a public body corporate and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The Authority is constituted as a public instrumentality exercising public functions, and the exercise by the Authority of the duties and powers conferred by this article shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth. The exercise of the powers granted by this article and its public purpose shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth.\n\nD. The Fort Monroe Authority is the successor in interest to that political subdivision formerly known as the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority. As such, the Authority stands in the place and stead of, and assumes all rights and duties formerly of, the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, including but not limited to all leases, contracts, grants-in-aid, and all other agreements of whatsoever nature; holds title to all realty and personalty formerly held by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority; and may exercise all powers that might at any time past have been exercised by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, including the powers and authorities of a Local Redevelopment Authority under the provisions of any and all applicable federal laws, including the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005.\n\nE. The Fort Monroe Authority shall be subject to the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.) and the Board shall adopt procedures consistent with that Act to govern its procurement processes.\n\nF. Employees of the Fort Monroe Authority shall be eligible for membership in the Virginia Retirement System and all of the health and related insurance and other benefits, including premium conversion and flexible benefits, available to state employees as provided by law.\n\nG. The provisions of the Virginia Personnel Act (§ 2.2-2900 et seq.) shall not apply to the Fort Monroe Authority.\n\n2011, c. 716; 2020, cc. 269, 800.",

The amount of such fee shall be determined as follows: (i) all property in the Area of Operation shall be assessed as if privately owned; (ii) property that would not be taxed if located elsewhere in the City of Hampton by virtue of the ownership, control, or use of the property, other than property classified solely under subdivision A 1 of § 58.1-3606, shall be excluded from the calculation of the fee in lieu of taxes; and (iii) the total assessed value, less any exemptions, shall then be divided by $100, multiplied by the then-current real estate tax rate set by the City of Hampton, minus the real estate taxes (a) owed to the City of Hampton directly from taxpayers other than the Authority within the Area of Operation, including lessees subject to taxation and billed to the lessee pursuant to subsection E, and (b) collected by the Authority and remitted to the City of Hampton pursuant to subsection E in the calendar year prior to the year for which the fee in lieu of taxes is then determined.

In the event the fee in lieu of taxes is not paid when due, interest thereon shall at that time accrue at the rate, not to exceed the maximum amount allowed by § 2.2-4355, determined by the City of Hampton until such time as the overdue payment and interest are paid.

Notwithstanding the provisions of § 58.1-3203, all real property in the Area of Operation that is leased, whether by short-term operating/revenue lease or long-term ground lease, shall be assessed as if it were privately owned, and each lessee thereof shall be subject to taxation to be billed and collected by the City of Hampton as if the lessee were the owner, regardless of the term; however, leases for a cumulative term of less than 20 years shall be billed to and collected from the Authority by the City of Hampton. For purposes of this subsection, \"cumulative term\" includes the original term plus any optional extensions or renewals of that term.

Any property not assessed by the City of Hampton pursuant to this subsection shall remain subject to the provisions of subsection B. This subsection shall not apply to leases of any term with other government entities.\n\nF.
