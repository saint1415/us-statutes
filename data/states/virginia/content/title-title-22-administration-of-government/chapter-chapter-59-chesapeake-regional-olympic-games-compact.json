      "text": "The General Assembly hereby enacts, and the Commonwealth of Virginia hereby enters into, the Chesapeake Regional Olympic Games Compact with any and all states legally joining therein according to its terms, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nCHESAPEAKE REGIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES COMPACT.\n\nArticle I. Purpose and Findings.\n\nA. The purpose of this compact shall be to create a regional authority to oversee the conduct of the 2012 Olympic Games, coordinated and managed by the local Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG), and to assure that the region's guarantees and commitments accepted in conjunction with hosting the Olympic Games are fulfilled.\n\nB. The General Assembly finds that:\n\n1. For some time, the State of Maryland (including the City of Baltimore), the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the nonprofit organization known as the Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition (WBRC 2012), have been actively engaged in national competition to win the U.S. Candidate City designation and, subsequently, the Host City designation and the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n2. Hosting the Olympic Games will provide several major, lasting, and unique benefits for all of the citizens of the Chesapeake region, including:\n\na. Direct, positive economic impact on our regional economy;\n\nb. An opportunity to showcase our region to the world;\n\nc. A catalyst for regional action; and\n\nd. A renewed sense of pride along with a tangible legacy (e.g. new and improved venues and enhanced transportation infrastructure).\n\n3. Independent economic studies show that preparing for and hosting the Olympic Games will have a positive economic impact on the region, including:\n\na. Direct and indirect spending in excess of $5,000,000,000;\n\nb. The creation of approximately 70,000 jobs;\n\nc. Increased tax revenues resulting from Olympic-related economic activity in excess of $130,000,000, without raising or creating any new taxes; and\n\nd. A lasting improvement in the region's competitive position within the travel/tourism industry, as well as the region's ability to attract new businesses.\n\n4. The citizens of the region have responded positively to WBRC 2012's efforts and solidly embraced the cause to host the Olympic Games, expressed in part by the endorsement of scores of local business, civic, governmental, academic, and amateur sports organizations, and by survey results that show (i) eighty-two percent of the region's residents support the effort to bring the 2012 Olympic Games to this area and (ii) eighty-six percent of area residents believe that the Olympic Games will bring substantial economic benefits to our region.\n\n5. Through the submission of the region's official bid proposal to the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on December 15, 2000, WBRC 2012 reached a milestone in the process of capturing the Olympic Games by providing a 631-page logistical, operational, and financial blueprint for hosting the 2012 Games.\n\n6. The bid proposal highlights the great venues and vistas found in our region and is developed around key principles, including (i) building less, not more and (ii) utilizing mass transit, and (iii) protecting the environment.\n\n7. In addition to the region's bid proposal, the USOC and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) require certain government guarantees and commitments in conjunction with hosting the 2012 Olympic Games, should our region win the U.S. Candidate City designation.\n\n8. Our unique regional approach to winning the right to host the Olympic Games creates the added complication of determining which entities will provide the necessary guarantees.\n\n9. It is incumbent upon WBRC 2012 and government leaders to move forward together now to craft the solution that best \"lives regionalism\" and maximizes the region's chances of winning the 2012 Olympic Games, and reaping the many benefits that come with this honor.\n\n10. Given that all four jurisdictions, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Baltimore, will host a significant number of events and reap substantial benefits, the most effective solution for all four jurisdictions is to enter into a single agreement that gives the USOC (and subsequently the IOC) a single focal point and a united front that reflects the regional nature of our bid.\n\nArticle II. Definitions.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n\"Bid Proposal\" means the bid formally submitted by WBRC 2012 to the USOC on December 15, 2000.\n\n\"Host City\" means the entity that has been selected by the International Olympic Committee to host the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n\"International Olympic Committee\" and \"IOC\" means the International Olympic Committee, a body corporate under international law created by the Congress of Paris of 23 June, 1894, and having perpetual succession.\n\n\"Olympic Games\" means any Olympic Games sponsored and governed by the International Olympic Committee and any other educational, cultural, athletic, or sporting events related or preliminary thereto.\n\n\"Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games,\" and \"OCOG\" means the Committee formed by WBRC 2012 to organize and conduct the Olympic Games, if WBRC 2012 is selected by the IOC as the host city in 2005.\n\n\"Signatories\" means the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the City of Baltimore.\n\n\"U.S. Candidate City\" means the entity that has received the United States Olympic Committee's endorsement to submit to the IOC the sole bid from the United States for the hosting of the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n\"United States Olympic Committee\" and \"USOC\" means the United States Olympic Committee, incorporated by Act of Congress on September 21, 1950, and having perpetual succession.\n\n\"WBRC 2012\" means Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition, a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland, and its successors.\n\nArticle III. Creation of Regional Authority.\n\nA. The Signatories hereby provide the mechanism for the creation and termination of the \"Chesapeake Regional Olympic Games Authority,\" hereinafter \"Regional Authority,\" which shall be an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the City of Baltimore, and shall have the powers and duties set forth herein, and those additional powers and duties conferred upon it by subsequent actions of the signatories.\n\nB. The Regional Authority shall come into existence by the force of this compact when and if, and only if, the IOC awards the 2012 Olympic Games in year 2005 to WBRC 2012, as the U.S. Candidate City and the official representative of the Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Baltimore region.\n\nC. The Regional Authority shall, if ever brought into existence, cease to exist by the force of this Compact on January 1, 2014, unless extended by substantially similar future legislation passed by each of the Signatories.\n\nD. Until such time as the Regional Authority comes into existence, the combined signatures of the Governors of Virginia and Maryland, and the Mayors of the District of Columbia and Baltimore, on any and all documents necessary and appropriate to the pursuit of the 2012 Olympic Games shall be deemed binding on future actions of the Regional Authority.\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, (i) the above referenced signatures may be on the same document, on separate but materially and substantially similar documents, or any combination thereof; and (ii) no individual signature shall be deemed effective until such time as all four above referenced signatures are obtained.\n\nArticle IV.
