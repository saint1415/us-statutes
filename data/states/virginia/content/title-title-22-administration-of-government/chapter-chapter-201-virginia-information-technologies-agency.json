If VITA, or any executive branch agency authorized by VITA, elects to procure personal computers and related peripheral equipment pursuant to any type of blanket purchasing arrangement under which public bodies, as defined in § 2.2-4301, may purchase such goods from any vendor following competitive procurement but without the conduct of an individual procurement by or for the using agency or institution, it shall establish performance-based specifications for the selection of equipment. Establishment of such contracts shall emphasize performance criteria including price, quality, and delivery without regard to \"brand name.\" All vendors meeting the Commonwealth's performance requirements shall be afforded the opportunity to compete for such contracts.\n\nF. VITA shall allow private institutions of higher education that are (i)(a) chartered in Virginia or (b) chartered by an Act of Congress in 1821 and that have owned and operated since 1991 a campus with a significant presence in the Commonwealth and (ii) granted tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to purchase directly from contracts established for state agencies and public bodies by VITA.\n\nG. This section shall not be construed or applied so as to infringe upon, in any manner, the responsibilities for accounting systems assigned to the Comptroller under § 2.2-803.\n\nH. The Comptroller shall not issue any warrant upon any voucher issued by an executive branch agency covering the purchase of any information technology when such purchases are made in violation of any provision of this chapter or the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.).\n\nI. Intentional violations of centralized purchasing requirements for information technology pursuant to this chapter by an executive branch agency, continued after notice from the Governor to desist, shall constitute malfeasance in office and shall subject the officer responsible for the violation to suspension or removal from office, as may be provided in law in other cases of malfeasance.\n\n1984, c. 746, §§ 2.1-563.16, 2.1-563.17, 2.1-563.18; 1985, c. 265; 1995, c. 357; 1997, c. 858; 1999, cc. 412, 421, 433; 2001, c. 844, § 2.2-1303; 2002, c. 579; 2003, cc. 352, 895, 981, 1021; 2004, cc. 237, 278; 2007, c. 630; 2010, cc. 136, 145; 2011, c. 739; 2012, cc. 803, 835; 2013, c. 583; 2014, cc. 36, 180; 2015, cc. 462, 760, 768, 776; 2016, c. 296.",

The recommendation shall describe the risks presented to the Commonwealth and how those risks are not sufficiently mitigated by the expected terms and conditions associated with the Request for Proposal. The CIO shall recommend a reasonable maximum alternative limitation of liability amount that is a multiple of the contract value, with the same exceptions to the limitation as provided in subsection B.\n\nThe Secretary of Administration shall review and may approve any recommended maximum alternative limitation of liability amount to be included in any Request for Proposal issued for the project. The CIO shall annually publish a list of all approvals granted under this subsection pertaining to any Request for Proposal issued in the previous 12-month period.\n\nD.
