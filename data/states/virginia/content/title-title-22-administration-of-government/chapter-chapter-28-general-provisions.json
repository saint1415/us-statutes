Whenever any officer, other than one whose office is created by the Constitution of Virginia, is indebted to the Commonwealth for money collected by him or improperly drawn by him or upon his order from the state treasury during his term of office and, after payment of such indebtedness is demanded by the Comptroller, such officer continues in default, the Comptroller shall not issue his warrant for, nor shall the State Treasurer pay, any part of the salary due, or to become due, to such officer until he has made good his default. He may, however, file his petition in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond against the Comptroller, asserting his claim to his salary, and asking for payment thereof. The Comptroller shall answer the petition, and the proceedings shall be held according to the provisions of Article 18 (§ 8.01-192 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 and § 8.01-255. If it is found that the petitioner is indebted, the Commonwealth shall be credited on his salary then due with the amount of such indebtedness and if, after such credit is given, there is a balance in his favor, judgment shall be rendered on his behalf. If the indebtedness exceeds his salary then due, judgment for the excess shall be rendered against him and the amount thereof, unless sooner paid, shall be credited to the Commonwealth on his salary thereafter becoming due. The Comptroller shall issue his warrant on the State Treasurer for the payment of any judgment rendered on behalf of the petitioner. In the proceeding by petition the Attorney General shall represent the Commonwealth, unless he is interested, in which case the Comptroller shall employ other counsel to represent the Commonwealth.\n\nB. If the officer fails to file a petition under this section within twelve months after payment of any installment of his salary is withheld, his right to file the petition shall be barred. In such case the Comptroller shall credit the Commonwealth on the officer's salary with the amount of his indebtedness, and make that fact appear on the books of his office.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 14-3, 14-4; 1964, cc. 386, §§ 14.1-3, 14.1-4; 1998, c. 872, § 2.1-20.7; 2001, c. 844.",

In accordance with the statewide telecommuting and alternative work schedule policy, to be developed by the Secretary of Administration pursuant to § 2.2-203.1, the head of each state agency shall establish a telecommuting and alternative work policy under which eligible employees of such agency may telecommute, participate in alternative work schedules, or both, to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance or service delivery. The policy shall identify types of employees eligible for telecommuting and alternative work schedules, the broad categories of positions determined to be ineligible for telecommuting and the justification therefor, any benefits of telecommuting including the use of alternate work locations that are separate from the agency's central workplace, and any benefits of using alternative work schedules. The policy shall promote use of Commonwealth information technology assets where feasible but may allow for eligible employees to use computers, computing devices, or related electronic equipment not owned or leased by the Commonwealth to telecommute, if such use is technically and economically practical, and so long as such use meets information security standards as established by the Virginia Information Technologies Agency, or receives an exception from such standards approved by the CIO of the Commonwealth or his designee. The policy shall be updated periodically as necessary.\n\nB. The head of each agency shall set annual percentage targets for the number of positions eligible for alternative work schedules. By July 1, 2009, each state agency shall have a goal of not less than 25 percent of its eligible workforce participating in alternative work schedules. By January 1, 2010, each state agency, except the Department of State Police, shall have a goal of not less than 20 percent of its eligible workforce telecommuting.\n\nC.

The same plan shall be offered to all part-time state employees, but the total cost shall be paid by such part-time employees. The Department of Human Resource Management shall administer this section. The plan chosen shall provide means whereby coverage for the families or dependents of state employees may be purchased. Except for part-time employees, the Commonwealth may pay all or a portion of the cost thereof, and for such portion as the Commonwealth does not pay, the employee, including a part-time employee, may purchase the coverage by paying the additional cost over the cost of coverage for an employee.\n\nSuch contribution shall be financed through appropriations provided by law.\n\nB. The plan shall:\n\n1. Include coverage for low-dose screening mammograms for determining the presence of occult breast cancer. Such coverage shall make available one screening mammogram to persons age 35 through 39, one such mammogram biennially to persons age 40 through 49, and one such mammogram annually to persons age 50 and over and may be limited to a benefit of $50 per mammogram subject to such dollar limits, deductibles, and coinsurance factors as are no less favorable than for physical illness generally.\n\nThe term \"mammogram\" shall mean an X-ray examination of the breast using equipment dedicated specifically for mammography, including but not limited to the X-ray tube, filter, compression device, screens, film, and cassettes, with an average radiation exposure of less than one rad mid-breast, two views of each breast.\n\nIn order to be considered a screening mammogram for which coverage shall be made available under this section:\n\na.

Medically necessary early intervention services for the population certified by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall mean those services designed to help an individual attain or retain the capability to function age-appropriately within his environment, and shall include services that enhance functional ability without effecting a cure.\n\nFor persons previously covered under the plan, there shall be no denial of coverage due to the existence of a preexisting condition. The cost of early intervention services shall not be applied to any contractual provision limiting the total amount of coverage paid by the insurer to or on behalf of the insured during the insured's lifetime.\n\n5. Include coverage for prescription drugs and devices approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use as contraceptives.\n\n6. Not deny coverage for any drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of cancer on the basis that the drug has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the specific type of cancer for which the drug has been prescribed, if the drug has been recognized as safe and effective for treatment of that specific type of cancer in one of the standard reference compendia.\n\n7.

The plan shall have a procedure by which an individual who has an ongoing special condition may, after consultation with the primary care physician, receive a referral to a specialist for such condition who shall be responsible for and capable of providing and coordinating the individual's primary and specialty care related to the initial specialty care referral. If such an individual's care would most appropriately be coordinated by such a specialist, the plan shall refer the individual to a specialist. For the purposes of this subdivision, \"special condition\" means a condition or disease that is (i) life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling and (ii) requires specialized medical care over a prolonged period of time. Within the treatment period authorized by the referral, such specialist shall be permitted to treat the individual without a further referral from the individual's primary care provider and may authorize such referrals, procedures, tests, and other medical services related to the initial referral as the individual's primary care provider would otherwise be permitted to provide or authorize. The plan shall have a procedure by which an individual who has an ongoing special condition that requires ongoing care from a specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist for the treatment of the special condition. If the primary care provider, in consultation with the plan and the specialist, if any, determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the plan or issuer shall make such a referral to a specialist. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the plan from requiring a participating specialist to provide written notification to the covered individual's primary care physician of any visit to such specialist. Such notification may include a description of the health care services rendered at the time of the visit.\n\n14.

Such treatment shall, at the covered employee's option, continue for the remainder of the employee's life for care directly related to the treatment of the terminal illness.\n\nA provider who continues to render health care services pursuant to this subdivision shall be reimbursed in accordance with the carrier's agreement with such provider existing immediately before the provider's termination of participation.\n\n15. Include coverage for patient costs incurred during participation in clinical trials for treatment studies on cancer, including ovarian cancer trials.\n\nThe reimbursement for patient costs incurred during participation in clinical trials for treatment studies on cancer shall be determined in the same manner as reimbursement is determined for other medical and surgical procedures.
