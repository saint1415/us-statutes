      "text": "A. 1. No later than January 13, 2009, the Governor shall submit to the General Assembly a tentative bill establishing a capital outlay plan that includes new capital outlay projects (and previously planned or authorized capital outlay projects) that the Governor proposes to be funded entirely or partially from general fund-supported resources for the six fiscal years beginning July 1, 2009. Projects included in the capital outlay plan shall be in addition to any projects for which funds are appropriated from the Central Maintenance Reserve of the general appropriation act.\n\n2. The capital outlay plan submitted by the Governor shall list capital outlay projects in different tiers. Each tier shall be a grouping of capital outlay projects with the total estimated cost of each project in the tier falling within a minimum and a maximum project cost assigned to the tier, provided that no estimated project costs shall be set out in the plan. The minimum and maximum range assigned to a tier shall be mutually exclusive of all other minimum and maximum ranges assigned to other tiers in order that no capital outlay project shall be reported in more than one tier.\n\nFor each capital outlay project listed in the plan the Governor shall provide the following information: (i) the agency or public educational institution to which the project is related, (ii) a description of the project, and (iii) a ranking number assigned to the project, which number shall signify the priority of the project when compared to all other projects of the agency or institution listed in the plan.\n\nB. For the 2021 Regular Session of the General Assembly and thereafter, the Governor shall ensure that a prefiled bill is submitted to the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations in accordance with the deadlines for prefiling under subdivision A 3 of § 30-19.3 for any proposed amendments to the current capital outlay plan enacted into law, including adjusting the fiscal years covered by the plan so that the plan will cover the six fiscal years beginning on the immediately following July 1. Any such prefiled bill shall be submitted using the format described in subsection A.\n\nIn submitting to the General Assembly prefiled bills for plan amendments, the Governor shall consider the capital outlay project list submitted by the Advisory Committee pursuant to § 2.2-1516 and any amendments to the six-year capital outlay plan recommended by the Advisory Committee pursuant to such section.\n\n2008, Sp.

The Central Capital Planning Fund, the State Agency Capital Account, and the Public Educational Institution Capital Account established pursuant to § 2.2-1520 shall be used to fund capital outlay projects included in the six-year capital outlay plan enacted into law.\n\n2. In addition, public educational institutions and state agencies may request authority and appropriation to conduct pre-planning for any such project using nongeneral fund sources. Such costs may be reimbursed up to the lesser of $250,000 or one percent of the project construction costs.\n\nB. A Virginia-based contractor who does not have the same number of years of comparable experience under construction management or design-build shall not be penalized for having less comparable experience in construction management or design-build projects, provided such contractor does have significant experience in constructing comparable projects under design-bid-build. The procuring entity shall consider the experience and quality of work that a contractor has done on projects comparable to the project being procured, whether under construction management, design-build, or design-bid-build. These factors shall be considered by the procuring entity in making its decisions in a pre-qualification or a contractor selection process.\n\nC. If at any time during the detailed planning phase the total cost of a capital outlay project is estimated to exceed a threshold amount set forth in the general appropriation act for the required use of value engineering, then value engineering shall be utilized for such project. Each agency and public educational institution shall retain documentation of the value engineering process conducted for any project, including documentation relating to (i) recommendations offered to the agency or institution, (ii) recommendations accepted and rejected by the agency or institution, and (iii) any savings to the agency or institution resulting from the adoption of each recommendation.\n\nD. For capital outlay projects for which an appropriation is made to the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, after an agency or public educational institution has received authorization to move to the construction phase of a project, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget shall transfer sufficient appropriation from the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, as appropriate.\n\nE. 1. Prior to an agency or public educational institution awarding a construction contract for a project, the Director of the Department of General Services shall review the lowest bid or best proposal for the project. If the total amount of such bid or proposal, plus previously expended funds and a reasonable allowance for contingencies, does not exceed 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources for the project as determined during the detailed planning phase, the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget may approve the contract. If the total amount of such bid or proposal, plus previously expended funds and a reasonable allowance for contingencies, exceeds 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources for the project, the Directors shall not approve the contract unless funding of that portion of such total project cost in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project is from nongeneral fund sources such as private funds, gifts, grants, auxiliary funds, or federal funds as appropriate.\n\n2. If an agency or public educational institution is unable to procure funding from nongeneral fund sources for that portion of such total project cost in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project, then the agency or institution may reduce the size or scope of the project as necessary to remain within 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project, provided that (i) it has completed a value engineering review by or in collaboration with the Department of General Services, (ii) it has provided a written, detailed analysis of the proposed reduction to the Governor and to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, and (iii) the project after such reduction in size or scope is substantially similar in quality and functionality to the original project.\n\n3. An agency or public educational institution may request a supplemental allocation of general fund-supported resources through the budget process only if it submits a written certification to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, the Director of the Department of General Services, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget, and, for public institutions of higher education only, the Executive Director of the State Council of Higher Education, which certification (i) states that additional funding from nongeneral fund sources as described in subdivision 1 will be insufficient to pay for the full amount of the project cost that is in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project and (ii) provides a detailed analysis and description of the project as modified for a reduction in size or scope as described in subdivision 2 as well as a justification for why such modifications in size or scope cannot be achieved.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall preclude an agency or public educational institution from providing for re-design or additional value engineering of projects or re-bidding or re-submitting of proposals.\n\n5. No construction contract for a capital outlay project included in the six-year capital outlay plan enacted into law shall be awarded unless first approved by the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget.\n\nF. After a project has been approved by the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget shall transfer to the project the remaining funds needed for construction from the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, as appropriate.\n\n2008, Sp.
