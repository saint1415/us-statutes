The Director may issue a permit to conduct field investigations if the Director determines that (i) it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and (ii) the applicant has identified a field supervisor who is a qualified professional archaeologist and who meets or exceeds the following standards:\n\n1. Holds a graduate degree in archaeology, anthropology, or a closely related field;\n\n2.

The permit shall require that all objects of antiquity that are recovered from state-controlled land shall be the exclusive property of the Commonwealth. Title to some or all objects of antiquity that are discovered or removed from a state archaeological site not located on state-controlled land may be retained by the owner of such land. All objects of antiquity that are discovered or recovered on or from state-controlled land shall be retained by the Commonwealth, unless they are released to the applicant by the Director.\n\nD. All field investigations, explorations, or recovery operations undertaken pursuant to a permit issued under this section shall be carried out under the general supervision of the Director and in a manner to ensure that the maximum amount of historic, scientific, archaeologic, and educational information may be recovered and preserved in addition to the physical recovery of objects.\n\nE.

Where unmarked burials are not part of a legally chartered cemetery, archaeological excavation of such burials pursuant to a permit from the Director shall be exempt from the requirements of §§ 57-38.1 and 57-39. However, such exemption shall not apply in the case of human burials within formally chartered cemeteries that have been abandoned.\n\nC. The Department shall be considered an interested party in court proceedings considering the abandonment of legally constituted cemeteries or family graveyards with historic significance. A permit from the Director is required if archaeological investigations are undertaken as a part of a court-approved removal of a cemetery.\n\nD. The Board shall promulgate regulations implementing this section that provide for appropriate public notice prior to issuance of a permit, provide for appropriate treatment of excavated remains, the scientific quality of the research conducted on the remains, and the appropriate disposition of the remains upon completion of the research. Such regulations shall also require consultation with any federally recognized Tribal Nations in the Commonwealth pursuant to § 10.1-2205.1. When a burial permit would result in the disturbance of a burial site of an individual that has a cultural affiliation with a particular federally recognized Tribal Nation in the Commonwealth, the Department shall consult and seek consensus with such federally recognized Tribal Nation in the Commonwealth in the consideration and drafting of the permit document. The Department may carry out such excavations and research without a permit, provided that it has complied with the substantive requirements of the regulations promulgated pursuant to this section.\n\nE. Any interested party may appeal the Director's decision to issue a permit or to act directly to excavate human remains to the local circuit court. Such appeal must be filed within 14 days of the Director's decision.\n\nF. For the purposes of this section, \"cultural affiliation\" has the same definition as provided in 25 U.S.C. § 3001(2) of the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq.) and its regulations. If doubt exists as to cultural affiliation, the federally recognized Tribal Nations in the Commonwealth with potential cultural affiliation shall make the determination.\n\n1989, c. 656; 2024, c. 830.",
