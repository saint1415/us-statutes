      "heading": "Nature of rights; subordination of interests",
      "text": "A. Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, the agency, or a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder. The interest of a holder is an interest in real property.\n\nB. A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other than a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property.\n\nC. An agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an environmental covenant. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided in the covenant.\n\nD. The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an environmental covenant is created or amended:\n\n1. An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant.\n\n2. This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant.\n\n3. A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant covering real property or in a separate record. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association.\n\n4. An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant or affect that person's existing liability.\n\n2010, c. 691.",

In addition to the information required by subsection A, an environmental covenant may contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by the persons who signed it, including:\n\n1. Any requirements for notice following transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the contamination on, the property subject to the covenant;\n\n2. Any requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant, including a requirement that a qualified and certified professional engineer inspect, investigate and report on the compliance with the covenant;\n\n3. Any rights of access to the property granted in connection with implementation or enforcement of the covenant;\n\n4. A brief narrative description of the contamination and remedy, including the contaminants of concern, the pathways of exposure, limits on exposure, and the location and extent of the contamination;\n\n5. Any limitations on amendment or termination of the covenant in addition to those contained in §§ 10.1-1245 and 10.1-1246; and\n\n6. Any rights of the holder in addition to its right to enforce the covenant pursuant to § 10.1-1247.\n\nC. In addition to other conditions for approval of an environmental covenant, the agency may require those persons specified by the agency who have interests in the real property to sign the covenant.\n\n2010, c. 691.",

It is not appurtenant to an interest in real property;\n\n2. It can be or has been assigned to a person other than the original holder;\n\n3. It is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law;\n\n4. It imposes a negative burden;\n\n5. It imposes an affirmative obligation on a person having an interest in the real property or on the holder;\n\n6. The benefit or burden does not touch or concern real property;\n\n7. There is no privity of estate or contract;\n\n8. The holder dies, ceases to exist, resigns, or is replaced; or\n\n9. The owner of an interest subject to the environmental covenant and the holder are the same person.\n\nC. An instrument that creates restrictions or obligations with respect to real property that would qualify as activity and use limitations except for the fact that the instrument was recorded before the effective date of this chapter is not invalid or unenforceable because of any of the limitations on enforcement of interests described in subsection B or because it was identified as an easement, servitude, deed restriction, or other interest. This chapter does not apply in any other respect to such an instrument.\n\nD. This chapter does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whether designated as an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable under the law of the Commonwealth.\n\nE. An environmental covenant pursuant to this chapter may be utilized only when agreed to by the agencies, owners, and holders to such covenant. When restrictions and obligations are imposed on real property in connection with an environmental response project, they may be drafted and recorded in any manner permissible under the laws of Virginia. This chapter applies only to activity and use limitations drafted and recorded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n2010, c. 691; 2012, c. 278.",

The court determines, after hearing, that the termination or modification will not adversely affect human health or the environment.\n\nB. If the agency that signed an environmental covenant has determined that the intended benefits of the covenant can no longer be realized, a court, under the doctrine of changed circumstances, in an action in which all persons identified in subsections A and B of § 10.1-1246 have been given notice, may terminate the covenant or reduce its burden on the real property subject to the covenant. The agency's determination or its failure to make a determination upon request is subject to review pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).\n\nC.
