In any county, city, or town where the Board proposes to designate a historic district, building, structure, object, or site as a historic landmark, or where the Director proposes to nominate property to the National Park Service for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a National Historic Landmark, the Department shall give written notice of the proposal to the governing body and to the owner, owners, or the owner's agent, of property proposed to be so designated or nominated, and to the owners, or their agents, of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property. The Department shall also consult with any federally recognized Tribal Nations in the Commonwealth pursuant to § 10.1-2205.1 if the designation or nomination is in a locality identified by the Ombudsman for Tribal Consultation pursuant to subdivision B 2 of § 2.2-401.01.\n\nB. Prior to the designation or nomination of a historic district, the Department shall hold a public hearing at the seat of government of the county, city, or town in which the proposed historic district is located or within the proposed historic district. The public hearing shall be for the purpose of supplying additional information to the Board and to the Director. The time and place of such hearing shall be determined in consultation with a duly authorized representative of the local governing body and shall be scheduled at a time and place that will reasonably allow for the attendance of the affected property owners. The Department shall publish notice of the public hearing once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the county, city, or town. Such notice shall specify the time and place of the public hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views, not less than six days nor more than 21 days after the second publication of the notice in such newspaper. In addition to publishing the notice, the Department shall give written notice of the public hearing at least five days before such hearing to the owner, owners, or the owner's agent, of each parcel of real property to be included in the proposed historic district, and to the owners, or their agents, of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the included property. Notice required to be given to owners by this subsection may be given concurrently with the notice required to be given to the owners by subsection A.

For the purposes of this chapter, a historic district means a geographically definable area that contains a significant concentration of historic buildings, structures, or sites having a common historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural heritage, and which may contain local tax parcels having separate owners. Contributing properties within a registered district are historic landmarks by definition.\n\nF.

In addition to funds that may be provided pursuant to subsection B or C, any organization that receives funds pursuant to subsection B or C may apply to the Director for a grant to perform extraordinary maintenance, renovation, repair, or reconstruction of any of its historical African American cemeteries and graves. However, a locality that is eligible for funding pursuant to subsection B or C may apply to the Director for such a grant without having received funding pursuant to subsection B or C. A locality's application for the grant shall not preclude another qualified organization from applying for funding pursuant to subsection B or C for the same cemetery or grave. A grant made pursuant to this subsection shall be made from any appropriation made available by the General Assembly for such purpose or from the Fund.\n\nG. Any locality may receive and hold funds drawn pursuant to subsection B or C on behalf of any qualified organization until such time as the organization is able to receive or utilize such funds. No local matching funds shall be required for any grants made pursuant to this section.\n\nH. The owner of a historical African American cemetery shall reasonably cooperate with a qualified organization that receives funds pursuant to subsection B or C.\n\n2017, c. 270; 2018, cc. 428, 433, 434, 614, 818; 2019, cc. 184, 251, 252, 257, 260, 268; 2020, cc. 82, 83, 455, 456; 2022, cc. 187, 450, 540, 541; 2023, cc. 95, 96.",

The organization owning the property grants to the Commonwealth a perpetual easement placing restrictions on alterations to, or development of, the property satisfactory to the Board, if the organization has received $50,000 or more within a four-year period pursuant to this section. The easement shall be for the purpose of preserving those features of the property which led to its designation as a historic landmark.\n\nNothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit any organization from charging a reasonable admission fee during the five-year period required in subdivision 2 herein if the fee is comparable to fees charged at similar facilities in the area.\n\nC.

The amount of the grant for each calendar year shall be paid to the Foundation in six equal annual installments on March 15 of each year beginning with the year of the Director's certification for the relevant calendar year.\n\nD. In no case shall the total amount of grants paid under this section exceed 20 percent of the estimated eligible restoration expenses of the historic presidential home. The Director is authorized to suspend the processing of charitable contribution submissions made by the Foundation if the Director reasonably believes that (i) such maximum amount may be exceeded or (ii) the material restoration will not be performed or such restoration work has been indefinitely suspended.\n\n2005, c. 470.",
