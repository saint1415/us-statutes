      "text": "A. As used in this section, \"person\" means any individual; corporation; partnership; association; limited liability company; local government; state agency, including any department, institution, authority, instrumentality, board, or other administrative agency of the Commonwealth; or other legal or commercial entity that operates or maintains a child welfare agency, adult day center, or assisted living facility.\n\nB. Every person who constitutes, or who operates or maintains, an assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency shall obtain the appropriate license from the Commissioner, which may be renewed. However, no license shall be required for an adult day center that provides services only to individuals enrolled in a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly program operated in accordance with an agreement between the provider, the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Commissioner, upon request, shall consult with, advise, and assist any person interested in securing and maintaining any such license. Each application for a license shall be made to the Commissioner, in such form as he may prescribe. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is an association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the names and addresses of its officers and agents. The application shall also contain a description of the activities proposed to be engaged in and the facilities and services to be employed, together with other pertinent information as the Commissioner may require. In the case of an application for licensure as a children's residential facility, the application shall also contain information regarding any complaints, enforcement actions, or sanctions against a license to operate a children's residential facility held by the applicant in another state.\n\nC. The licenses shall be issued on forms prescribed by the Commissioner. Any two or more licenses may be issued for concurrent operation of more than one assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency, but each license shall be issued upon a separate form. Each license and renewals thereof for an assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency may be issued for periods of up to three successive years, unless sooner revoked or surrendered.\n\nD. The length of each license or renewal thereof for an assisted living facility shall be based on the judgment of the Commissioner regarding the compliance history of the facility and the extent to which it meets or exceeds state licensing standards. On the basis of this judgment, the Commissioner may issue licenses or renewals thereof for periods of six months, one year, two years, or three years.\n\nE. The Commissioner may extend or shorten the duration of licensure periods for a child welfare agency whenever, in his sole discretion, it is administratively necessary to redistribute the workload for greater efficiency in staff utilization.\n\nF. Each license shall indicate the maximum number of persons who may be cared for in the assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency for which it is issued.\n\nG. The license and any other documents required by the Commissioner shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.\n\nH. Every person issued a license that has not been suspended or revoked shall renew such license prior to its expiration.\n\nI. Officers, employees, or agents of the Commonwealth, or of any county, city, or town acting within the scope of their authority as such, who serve as or maintain a child-placing agency shall not be required to be licensed.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 63-23.1, 63-233, 63-234; 1954, c. 259; 1968, cc. 578, 585, §§ 63.1-175, 63.1-196, 63.1-197; 1972, c. 540, § 63.1-196.1; 1973, c. 227; 1974 c. 419; 1975 c. 386; 1979, cc. 461, 483; 1981, c. 222; 1983, c. 153; 1985 c. 384; 1987, cc. 693, 698; 1991, c. 532; 1992, cc. 356, 666, § 63.1-194.5; 1993, cc. 730, 742, 957, 993; 1994, c. 686; 1996, c. 747; 1999, cc. 740, 964; 2000, cc. 178, 203; 2002 cc. 380, 747; 2016, c. 22; 2017, c. 196; 2018, c. 274; 2020, cc. 723, 860, 861; 2024, cc. 37, 150.",

Such contract shall require the interim administrator to comply with any and all requirements established by the Department to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. Prior to or upon conclusion of the period of interim administration, management, or operation, an inspection shall be conducted to determine whether operation of the assisted living facility shall be permitted to continue or should cease. Such interim administration, management, or operation shall not be permitted when defects in the conditions of the premises of the assisted living facility (i) present immediate and substantial risks to the health, safety, and welfare of residents, and (ii) may not be corrected within a reasonable period of time.

The Board shall adopt regulations for the Commissioner to use in determining when the imposition of administrative sanctions or initiation of court proceedings, severally or jointly, is appropriate in order to ensure prompt correction of violations in assisted living facilities and adult day centers involving noncompliance with state law or regulation as discovered through any inspection or investigation conducted by the Departments of Social Services, Health, or Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. The Commissioner may impose such sanctions or take such actions as are appropriate for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle or any regulation adopted under any provision of this subtitle that adversely affects the health, safety or welfare of an assisted living facility resident or an adult day center participant. Such sanctions or actions may include (i) petitioning the court to appoint a receiver for (a) any assisted living facility pursuant to subsection E or (b) adult day center and (ii) revoking or denying renewal of the license for the assisted living facility or adult day center for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle, § 54.1-3408 or any regulation adopted under this subtitle that violation adversely affects, or is an immediate and substantial threat to, the health, safety or welfare of the person cared for therein, or for permitting, aiding or abetting the commission of any illegal act in an assisted living facility or adult day center.\n\nC.

The notice of summary suspension shall set forth (a) the summary suspension procedures, (b) hearing and appeal rights as provided under this subsection, (c) facts and evidence that formed the basis for which the summary suspension is sought, and (d) the time, date, and location of the hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such notice shall be served on the assisted living facility or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the assisted living facility.\n\nThe summary suspension hearing shall be presided over by a hearing officer selected by the Commissioner from a list prepared by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia and shall be held as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days following service of the notice of hearing; however, the hearing officer may grant a written request for a continuance, not to exceed an additional 10 business days, for good cause shown. Within 10 business days after such hearing, the hearing officer shall provide to the Commissioner written findings and conclusions, together with a recommendation as to whether the license should be summarily suspended.\n\nWithin 10 business days of the receipt of the hearing officer's findings, conclusions, and recommendation, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or an order that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. The Commissioner shall adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision unless to do so would be an error of law or Department policy. In the event that the Commissioner rejects a hearing officer's findings, conclusions, or recommended decision, the Commissioner shall state with particularity the basis for rejection. In issuing a final order of summary suspension, the Commissioner may suspend the license of the assisted living facility or suspend only certain authority of the assisted living facility to provide certain services or perform certain functions that the Commissioner determines should be restricted or modified in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents receiving care. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the assisted living facility may appeal the Commissioner's decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following service of the order. A copy of any final order of summary suspension shall be prominently displayed by the provider at each public entrance of the facility, or in lieu thereof, the provider may display a written statement summarizing the terms of the order in a prominent location, printed in a clear and legible size and typeface, and identifying the location within the facility where the final order of summary suspension may be reviewed.\n\nUpon appeal, the sole issue before the court shall be whether the Department had reasonable grounds to require the assisted living facility to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. Any concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension. The willful and material failure to comply with the final order of summary suspension shall constitute an offense under subdivision 3 of § 63.2-1712. At the request of the Commissioner, all agencies and subdivisions of the Commonwealth shall cooperate with the Commissioner in the relocation of residents of an assisted living facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to residents.\n\nD. Notice of the Commissioner's intent to revoke or deny renewal of the license for an assisted living facility or to summarily suspend the license of an assisted living facility shall be provided by the Department and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a prominent place at each public entrance of the licensed premises to advise consumers of serious or persistent violations. In determining whether to deny, revoke, or summarily suspend a license, the Commissioner may choose to deny, revoke, or summarily suspend only certain authority of the assisted living facility to operate and may restrict or modify the assisted living facility's authority to provide certain services or perform certain functions that the Commissioner determines should be restricted or modified in order to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the residents. Such proposed denial, revocation, or summary suspension of certain services or functions may be appealed (i) if the assisted living facility is operated by an agency of the Commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of § 63.2-1710.2 and (ii) for all other assisted living facilities as otherwise provided in this subtitle for any denial, revocation, or summary suspension.\n\nE. In addition to the enforcements, sanctions, and civil penalties provided in this section, the Commissioner may petition the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which any assisted living facility, as defined in § 63.2-100, is located for the appointment of a receiver in accordance with the provisions of this section whenever (i) such assisted living facility shall (a) receive official notice from the Commissioner that its license has been or will be denied, revoked, or suspended or (b) operate at any time under conditions that present a major and continuing threat to the health, safety, security, rights, or welfare of the residents, including the threat of imminent abandonment by the owner or operatory or a pattern of failure to meet ongoing financial obligations such as the inability to pay for essential food, pharmaceuticals, personnel, ore required insurance, and (ii) the assisted living facility is unable to make adequate and timely arrangements for all residents to relocate in order to ensure their continued health, safety, and welfare.\n\nUpon the filing of a petition for appointment of a receiver, the court shall hold a hearing within 10 days, at which time the Department and the owner or operator of the facility may participate and present evidence. The court may grant the petition if it finds any one of the conditions identified in clause (i) to exist in combination with the condition identified in clause (ii) and the court further finds that such conditions will not be remedied and that the residents will not be protected unless the petition is granted.\n\nNo receivership established under this subsection shall continue in effect for more than 180 days without further order of the court, nor shall the receivership continue in effect following the revocation or denial of the assisted living facility's license, except to enforce any post-termination duties of the assisted living facility as required by the law.\n\nThe appointed receiver shall be a person licensed as an assisted living facility administrator in the Commonwealth pursuant to Title 54.1 or, if not so licensed, shall employ and supervise a person so licensed to administer the day-to-day business of the assisted living facility.\n\nThe appointed receiver shall have (a) such powers and duties to manage the assisted living facility as the court may grant and direct, including to accomplish the orderly relocation of all residents and the right to refuse to admit new residents during the receivership; (b) the power to receive, conserve, protect, and disburse funds on behalf of the owner or operator of the assisted living facility; (c) the power to execute and avoid executory contracts; (d) the power to hire and discharge employees; and (e) the power to do all other acts, including the filing of such reports as the court may direct, subject to accounting to the court therefor and otherwise consistent with state and federal laws, necessary to protect the residents from the threat or threats set forth in the original petitions, as well as such other threats arising thereafter or out of the same conditions.\n\nThe court may grant injunctive relief as it deems appropriate to the Department or to the appointed receiver either in conjunction with or subsequent to the granting of a petition for appointment of a receiver under this subsection.\n\nThe court may terminate the receivership on the motion of the Department, the receiver, or the owner or operator, upon finding, after a hearing, that either (1) the conditions described in the petition have been substantially eliminated or remedied or (2) all residents in the assisted living facility have been relocated. Within 30 days after such termination, the receiver shall file a complete report of his activities with the court, including an accounting for all property of which he has taken possession and all funds collected.\n\nAll costs of administration of a receivership hereunder shall be paid by the receiver out of resident fees. The court, after terminating such receivership, shall enter appropriate orders to ensure such payments upon its approval of the receiver's reports.\n\nA receiver appointed under this subsection shall be an officer of the court, shall not be liable for conditions at the assisted living facility that existed or originated prior to his appointment, and shall not be personally liable, except for his own gross negligence and intentional acts that result in injuries to persons or damage to property at the assisted living facility during his receivership.\n\nThe provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to relieve any owner, operator, or other party of any duty imposed by law or of any civil or criminal liability incurred by reason of any act or omission of such owner, operatory or other party.\n\nCode 1950, § 63-249; 1968, c. 578, § 63.1-212; 1991, c. 532, § 63.1-179.1; 1992, c. 356, § 63.1-194.9; 1993, cc. 730, 742, 957, 993, § 63.1-211.3; 1998, cc. 115, 397, 850; 2002, c. 747; 2005, cc. 610, 924; 2009, cc. 813, 840; 2018, c. 274; 2019, c. 449; 2024, cc. 37, 150; 2025, c. 616.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, following a proceeding as provided in § 2.2-4019, the Commissioner may issue a special order (i) for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle, § 54.1-3408, or any regulation adopted under any provision of this subtitle which violation adversely affects, or is an imminent and substantial threat to, the health, safety, or welfare of the person cared for therein, or (ii) for permitting, aiding, or abetting the commission of any illegal act in an assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency. Notice of the Commissioner's intent to take any of the actions enumerated in subdivisions B 1 through B 7 shall be provided by the Department and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a prominent place at each public entrance of the licensed premises to advise consumers of serious or persistent violations. The issuance of a special order shall be considered a case decision as defined in § 2.2-4001. Actions set forth in subsection B may be appealed by (a) an assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency operated by an agency of the Commonwealth in accordance with § 63.2-1710.2 or (b) any other assisted living facility, adult day center, or child welfare agency in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). The Commissioner shall not delegate his authority to impose civil penalties in conjunction with the issuance of special orders.\n\nB. The Commissioner may take the following actions regarding assisted living facilities, adult day centers, and child welfare agencies through the issuance of a special order and may require a copy of the special order provided by the Department to be posted in a prominent place at each public entrance of the licensed premises to advise consumers of serious or persistent violations:\n\n1. Place a licensee on probation upon finding that the licensee is substantially out of compliance with the terms of its license and that the health and safety of residents, participants, or children are at risk;\n\n2. Reduce licensed capacity or prohibit new admissions when the Commissioner concludes that the licensee cannot make necessary corrections to achieve compliance with regulations except by a temporary restriction of its scope of service;\n\n3. Mandate training for the licensee or licensee's employees, with any costs to be borne by the licensee, when the Commissioner concludes that the lack of such training has led directly to violations of regulations;\n\n4. Assess civil penalties for each day the assisted living facility is or was out of compliance with the terms of its license and the health, safety, and welfare of residents are at risk, which shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Assisted Living Facility Education, Training, and Technical Assistance Fund created pursuant to § 63.2-1803.1; however, no civil penalty shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision on any assisted living facility operated by an agency of the Commonwealth. The aggregate amount of such civil penalties shall not exceed $10,000 for assisted living facilities in any 12-month period. Criteria for imposition of civil penalties and amounts, expressed in ranges, shall be developed by the Board, and shall be based upon the severity, pervasiveness, duration, and degree of risk to the health, safety, or welfare of residents. Such civil penalties shall be applied by the Commissioner in a consistent manner. Such criteria shall also provide that (i) the Commissioner may accept a plan of correction, including a schedule of compliance, from an assisted living facility prior to setting a civil penalty, and (ii) the Commissioner may reduce or abate the penalty amount if the facility complies with the plan of correction within its terms.\n\nA single act, omission, or incident shall not give rise to imposition of multiple civil penalties even though such act, omission, or incident may violate more than one statute or regulation. A civil penalty that is not appealed becomes due on the first day after the appeal period expires. The license of an assisted living facility that has failed to pay a civil penalty due under this section shall not be renewed until the civil penalty has been paid in full, with interest, provided that the Commissioner may renew a license when an unpaid civil penalty is the subject of a pending appeal;\n\n5. Assess civil penalties of not more than $500 per inspection upon finding that the adult day center or child welfare agency is substantially out of compliance with the terms of its license and the health and safety of residents, participants, or children are at risk; however, no civil penalty shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision on any adult day center or child welfare agency operated by an agency of the Commonwealth;\n\n6. Require licensees to contact parents, guardians, or other responsible persons in writing regarding health and safety violations; and\n\n7. Prevent licensees who are substantially out of compliance with the licensure terms or in violation of the regulations from receiving public funds.\n\nC. The Board shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this section.\n\n2005, cc. 610, 924; 2017, cc. 138, 283; 2018, c. 274; 2024, cc. 37, 150.",

As a condition of employment, volunteering, or providing services on a regular basis, every children's residential facility that is regulated or operated by the Departments of Social Services, Education, Military Affairs, or Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall require any individual who (i) accepts a position of employment at such a facility, (ii) is employed by such a facility, (iii) volunteers for such a facility, or (iv) provides contractual services directly to a juvenile for such a facility to submit to fingerprinting and to provide personal descriptive information, to be forwarded along with the applicant's fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such applicant. The children's residential facility shall inform the applicant that he is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report and to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any such report and obtain a prompt resolution before a final determination is made of the applicant's eligibility to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. The applicant shall provide the children's residential facility with a written statement or affirmation disclosing whether he has ever been convicted of or is the subject of pending charges for any offense within or outside the Commonwealth. The results of the criminal history background check must be received prior to permitting an applicant to work in the children's residential facility.\n\nThe Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an individual's record or notification that no record exists, shall forward it to the state agency which operates or regulates the children's residential facility with which the applicant is affiliated. The state agency shall, upon receipt of an applicant's record lacking disposition data, conduct research in whatever state and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data. The state agency shall report to the children's facility whether the applicant is eligible to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B, no children's residential facility regulated or operated by the Departments of Education, Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, Military Affairs, or Social Services shall hire for compensated employment or allow to volunteer or provide contractual services persons who have been convicted of or are the subject of pending charges for (a) any offense set forth in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (v) of the definition of barrier crime in § 19.2-392.02 or (b) any offense set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of barrier crime in § 19.2-392.02 (1) in the five years prior to the application date for employment, to be a volunteer, or to provide contractual services or (2) such person continues on probation or parole or has failed to pay required court costs for such offense set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of barrier crime in § 19.2-392.02. The provisions of this section also shall apply to residential programs established pursuant to § 16.1-309.3 for juvenile offenders cited in a complaint for intake or in a petition before the court that alleges the juvenile is delinquent or in need of services or supervision and to local secure detention facilities, provided, however, that the provisions of this section related to local secure detention facilities shall only apply to an individual who, on or after July 1, 2013, accepts a position of employment at such local secure detention facility, volunteers at such local secure detention facility on a regular basis and will be alone with a juvenile in the performance of his duties, or provides contractual services directly to a juvenile at a local secure detention facility on a regular basis and will be alone with a juvenile in the performance of his duties. The Central Criminal Records Exchange and the state or local agency that regulates or operates the local secure detention facility shall process the criminal history record information regarding such applicant in accordance with this subsection and subsection B.\n\nB. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, a children's residential facility may hire for compensated employment or for volunteer or contractual service purposes persons who have been convicted of not more than one misdemeanor offense under § 18.2-57 or 18.2-57.2, or any substantially similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction, if 10 years have elapsed following the conviction, unless the person committed such offense in the scope of his employment, volunteer, or contractual services.\n\nIf the applicant is denied employment or the opportunity to volunteer or provide services at a children's residential facility because of information appearing on his criminal history record, and the applicant disputes the information upon which the denial was based, upon written request of the applicant the state agency shall furnish the applicant the procedures for obtaining his criminal history record from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The information provided to the children's residential facility shall not be disseminated except as provided in this section.\n\nC. Those individuals listed in clauses (i) through (iv) of subsection A also shall authorize the children's residential facility to obtain a copy of information from the central registry maintained pursuant to § 63.2-1515 on any investigation of child abuse or neglect undertaken on him. The applicant shall provide the children's residential facility with a written statement or affirmation disclosing whether he has ever been the subject of a founded case of child abuse or neglect within or outside the Commonwealth. The children's residential facility shall receive the results of the central registry search prior to permitting an applicant to work. Children's residential facilities regulated or operated by the Departments of Education; Behavioral Health and Developmental Services; Military Affairs; and Social Services shall not hire for compensated employment or allow to volunteer or provide contractual services, persons who have a founded case of child abuse or neglect.
