Use of rates higher than prima facie rates. An insurer may file for approval of and use rates that are higher than the prima facie rates set forth in § 38.2-3726 or published as set forth in § 38.2-3727, to the extent adjusted by § 38.2-3730. In order to use these higher rates, it shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the use of such higher rates will result in a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned (assuming the use of such higher rates) that is not less than the loss ratios as required by § 38.2-3725 D and E for those accounts to which such higher rates apply and that such upward deviations will not result on a statewide basis for that insurer of a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned of less than the expected loss ratio underlying the current prima facie rate developed or adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730. Deviations effective for 1993 and 1994 for credit life insurance shall be derived based upon a fifty percent loss ratio.\n\nIf rates higher than the prima facie rates provided for in §§ 38.2-3726 and 38.2-3727, to the extent adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730, are filed for approval, the filing shall specify the account or accounts to which such rates apply. Such rates may be applied on an equitable basis approved by the Commission to only one or more accounts specified by the insurer for which the experience has been less favorable than expected.\n\nC. Approval period of deviated rates.\n\n1. A deviated rate will be in effect for a period of time not longer than the experience period used to establish such rate. In no event will deviated rates remain in effect after the effective date that new prima facie rates are effective as set forth in § 38.2-3730.\n\n2.

Refund formulas which any insurer desires to use for decreasing term credit life insurance with terms of more than sixty-one months must develop refunds which are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the actuarial method. Refund formulas for decreasing term credit life insurance with terms of sixty-one months or less must develop refunds which are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the Rule of 78 or the actuarial method, whichever method is consistent with the original method of premium calculation. Refund formulas for credit accident and sickness insurance shall develop refunds that are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the actuarial method. The actuarial method will result in refunds equal to the premium cost of scheduled benefits subsequent to the date of cancellation or termination, computed at the schedule of premium rates in effect on the date of issue. The refund of premiums for level term credit life insurance shall be no less than the pro rata unearned gross premium. Refund formulas must be filed with and approved by the Commission prior to use.\n\nD. The requirements of subsection C of this section that refund formulas be filed with the Commission shall be considered fulfilled if the refund formulas are set forth in the individual policy or group certificate filed with the Commission.\n\nE.

From the end of the loan month if sixteen days or more of a loan month have been earned, provided that, if fifteen days or less of a loan month have been earned, the refund is computed from the beginning of the loan month.\n\nF. No refund of five dollars or less need be made.\n\nG. Voluntary prepayment of indebtedness. If a debtor prepays the indebtedness other than as a result of death:\n\n1. Any credit life insurance covering such indebtedness shall be terminated and an appropriate refund of the credit life insurance premium shall be paid or credited to the person entitled to the refund in accordance with this section; and\n\n2.

No refund need be paid during any period of disability for which credit accident and sickness benefits are payable. A refund shall be computed as if prepayment occurred at the end of the disability period.\n\nH. Involuntary prepayment of indebtedness. If an indebtedness is prepaid by the proceeds of a credit life insurance policy covering the debtor, then it shall be the responsibility of the insurer to see that the following are paid to the insured debtor, if living, or the beneficiary, other than the creditor, named by the debtor or to the debtor's estate:\n\n1. An appropriate refund of the credit accident and sickness insurance premium in accordance with this section; and\n\n2.
