Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, the transfer of risk under any reinsurance agreement may be effected by entry of an order by the Commission approving the transaction whenever (i) the Commission finds a licensed insurer to be impaired or in hazardous financial condition, (ii) a delinquency proceeding has been instituted against the licensed insurer for the purpose of conserving, rehabilitating, or liquidating the insurer, or (iii) the Commission finds, after giving the insurer notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the transfer of the contracts is in the best interests of the policyholders. In granting any such approval, the Commission shall ensure that policyholders do not lose any rights or claims afforded under their original policies pursuant to Chapter 16 (§ 38.2-1600 et seq.) or 17 (§ 38.2-1700 et seq.) of this title. Prior to granting an approval under clause (iii), the Commission shall consider whether there is a reasonable expectation that the ceding insurer may not be able to meet its obligations to all policyholders; whether the ceding insurer's continued operation in this Commonwealth may become hazardous to policyholders, creditors and the public in this Commonwealth; or whether the ceding insurer may otherwise be unable to comply with the provisions of this title.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 38-160, 38-519; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-26; 1986, c. 562; 1993, c. 158.",
