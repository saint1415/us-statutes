Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.\n\n\"Covered claim\" means an unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, submitted by a claimant, that (i) arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of a policy covered by this chapter and issued by an insurer who has been declared to be an insolvent insurer or (ii) arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of a policy that would not be excluded from the coverage of this chapter under the provisions of § 38.2-1601 if it were a policy of direct insurance and that has been assumed as a direct obligation by an insurer who has been declared to be an insolvent insurer, where such obligation is assumed through a merger or acquisition, or pursuant to an acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities, an assumption under the provisions of subsection B or C of § 38.2-136 or a substantially similar law of another jurisdiction, or any other novation agreement. The claimant or insured shall be a resident of the Commonwealth at the time of the insured loss, provided that for entities other than an individual, the residence of a claimant or insured is the state in which its principal place of business is located at the time of the insured loss or the property from which the claim arises shall be permanently located in the Commonwealth. \"Covered claim\" shall not include any amount awarded as punitive damages or sought as a return of premium under any retrospective rating plan; any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association as subrogation recoveries, reinsurance recoveries, contribution, indemnification, or otherwise; any amount due under any policy originally issued by a surplus lines carrier or risk retention group; any obligation assumed by an insolvent insurer after the commencement of any delinquency proceeding, as defined in Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.), involving the insolvent insurer or the original insurer, unless it would have been a \"covered claim\" absent such assumption; or any obligation assumed by an insolvent insurer in a transaction in which the original insurer remains separately liable. An obligation owing under a contract of reinsurance shall not be deemed a direct obligation for the purposes of this definition unless it shall have been assumed pursuant to the provisions of subsection B or C of § 38.2-136 or a substantially similar law of another jurisdiction. No claim for any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association may be asserted against a person insured under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer other than to the extent the claim exceeds the association obligation limitations set forth in § 38.2-1606.\n\n\"Insolvent insurer\" means an insurer that is (i) licensed to transact the business of insurance in the Commonwealth either at the time the policy was issued, when the obligation with respect to the covered claim was assumed, or when the insured loss occurred and (ii) against whom an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered after July 1, 1987, by a court of competent jurisdiction in the insurer's state of domicile or of the Commonwealth under the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.), and which order of liquidation has not been stayed or been the subject of a writ of supersedeas or other comparable order.\n\n\"Member insurer\" means any person who (i) writes any class of insurance to which this chapter applies under § 38.2-1601, including reciprocal insurance contracts, and (ii) is licensed to transact the business of insurance in the Commonwealth but shall not include persons listed in subdivision 9 of § 38.2-1601.\n\n\"Net direct written premiums\" means direct gross premiums written in the Commonwealth on insurance policies applicable to this chapter, less return premiums and dividends paid or credited to policyholders on direct business. \"Net direct written premiums\" does not include premiums on contracts between insurers or reinsurers.\n\n1970, c. 766, § 38.1-760; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 529; 1998, c. 230; 2004, c. 285; 2015, c. 710.",

Be obligated to pay covered claims that existed prior to the determination of insolvency and which arose before the earliest of (i) ninety-one days after the determination of insolvency, (ii) the policy expiration date, or (iii) the date the insured replaces or cancels the policy.\n\na. Such obligation shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows:\n\n(i) The full amount of a covered claim for benefits under a workers' compensation insurance coverage; or\n\n(ii) An amount not exceeding $300,000 per claimant for all other covered claims.\n\nb. In no event shall the Association be obligated to pay a claimant for an amount in excess of the insolvent insurer's obligation for a covered claim. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the Guaranty Association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. The Association shall pay only that amount of each unearned premium which is in excess of fifty dollars. A covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the Association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer.\n\n2. Be deemed the insurer to the extent of the insolvent insurer's obligation on the covered claims and to that extent shall have all the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\n\n3. Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts and assess member insurers separately for each account (i) the amounts necessary to pay the obligations of the Association under subdivision 1 of this subsection subsequent to an insolvency, (ii) the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and (iii) other expenses authorized by this chapter. The assessment of each member insurer shall be based on the ratio of the net direct written premiums of the member insurer to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers. This ratio shall be determined using the premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the classes of insurance in the account. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment at least thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than two percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the classes of insurance in the account. If the sum of the maximum assessment and the assets of the account does not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon as funds become available. The Association shall pay claims in any order which it may deem reasonable, including the payment of claims as such are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims. The Association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if payment of the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect an impairment of the insurer's minimum capital and surplus in any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance; provided, that during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payments shall not cause an impairment of minimum capital and surplus. These payments shall be refunded to those members receiving larger assessments by virtue of the deferment, or at the election of any such company, credited against future assessments. Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, payments authorized by the Association and made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of those claims. The offset shall be allowed only if the payments are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made.\n\n3a. The Association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than assessments paid pursuant to subdivision 3 (iii) of this subsection, a certificate of contribution in a form prescribed by the Commission, for the amount of the assessment paid, excluding interest penalties. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer on its financial statement as an asset. This shall be shown in a form, in an amount, and for a period of time approved by the Commission.\n\n4. Investigate claims brought against the Association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the Association's obligation and deny all other claims. The Association may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which the settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested.\n\n5. Notify those persons as the Commission directs under subdivision 8 of this subsection.\n\n6. Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to (i) the approval of the Commission and (ii) acceptance by the designated insurer.\n\n7. Reimburse each servicing facility for the Association's obligations paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the Association. The Association shall pay the other expenses authorized by this chapter.\n\n8. Notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determination of insolvency and of their rights under this chapter. Notification shall be sent by mail to the insureds' last known address. If the Association is unable to obtain the information required to mail the notice in a timely manner, the Association shall publish the notice in newspapers of general circulation likely to cover geographical areas occupied by the policyholders.\n\nB. The Association may:\n\n1. Employ or retain persons necessary to perform the duties of the Association.\n\n2. Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation.\n\n3. Sue or be sued.\n\n4. Negotiate and become a party to those contracts necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter.\n\n5. Perform any other acts necessary or proper to achieve the purpose of this chapter.\n\n6. Pay refunds to the member insurers in proportion to their contributions made to each account during the five years immediately preceding the date of the refund. The total refund shall be the amount by which the assets of the account are expected to exceed the liabilities for the coming year as determined by the board of directors.\n\n7. Obtain commitments or lines of credit, and in the event a natural disaster such as an earthquake, windstorm or fire results in covered claims, with the approval of its board of directors and the Commission, secure indebtedness for borrowed money to be used for the purpose set forth in subsection A of § 38.2-1622 in an amount not to exceed the amount reasonably estimated by its board of directors and the Commission as the aggregate amount of assessments which the Association will be authorized to make during the succeeding calendar year, by pledge, assignment, transfer in trust or hypothecation of any or all of the assessments to be made against its member insurers.\n\n1970, c. 766, §§ 38.1-763, 38.1-765; 1971, Ex.

Such amount may be amortized as follows:\n\n1. Certificates of contribution issued prior to January 1, 1998, shall be amortized in each succeeding calendar year through December 31, 1997, at an amount not to exceed 0.05 of one percent of the member's direct gross premium income for the classes of insurance in the account for which the member insurer is assessed. As used herein, the definition of direct gross premium income shall be the same as that specified in § 58.1-2500. If the amount of the certificate has not been fully amortized by the contributing insurer by December 31, 1997, the unamortized balance of the certificate amount shall be amortized, at the option of the contributing insurer, either (i) in the same manner as the certificate was amortized prior to January 1, 1998; however, if not amortized in full prior to calendar year 2010, the unamortized balance of the certificate shall be amortized in full during calendar year 2010, or (ii) over the 10 successive calendar years commencing January 1, 1998, in amounts each equal to 10 percent of such unamortized balance. A contributing insurer whose certificate has not been fully amortized by December 31, 1997, shall notify the Commission in writing of the amortization schedule option it has selected on or before March 1, 1998; however, if a contributing insurer fails to notify the Commission by such date, the insurer shall be deemed to have selected the option described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence.\n\n2. Certificates of contribution issued on or after January 1, 1998, shall be amortized over the 10 calendar years following the year the contribution was paid in amounts each equal to 10 percent of the amount of the contribution.\n\nB. The insurer may offset the amount of the certificate amortized in a calendar year as provided in subsection A. This amount shall be deducted from the premium tax liability incurred on business transacted in this Commonwealth for that year. However, the Association shall diligently pursue all rights available to it to recover its expenditures made in the fulfillment of its responsibilities under this chapter. In the event the Commission determines after a hearing that the Association is not diligently pursuing available measures of recovery, the Commission shall notify the Department of Taxation and participating insurers will not be able to offset amounts amortized during the period that the Commission determines that the Association has not been diligently pursuing available measures of recovery.\n\nC. Any sums that have been (i) amortized by contributing insurers and offset against premium taxes as provided in subsection B and (ii) subsequently refunded pursuant to subdivision A 3 of § 38.2-1606 or subdivision B 6 of § 38.2-1606 shall be paid to the Department of Taxation and deposited with the State Treasurer for credit to the general fund of this Commonwealth.\n\nD. The amount of any credit against premium taxes provided for in this section for an insurer shall be reduced by the amount of reduction in federal income taxes for any deduction claimed by the insurer for an assessment paid pursuant to this chapter.\n\n1987, cc. 565, 655; 1991, c. 371; 1997, c. 160; 2011, c. 850; 2014, c. 154.",
