Before any joint agreement for the merger of a corporation licensed under this chapter is submitted to the members, it shall first be submitted to and approved by the Commission. The Commission shall approve the agreement, unless, after giving notice and opportunity to be heard, it determines that:\n\n1. After the merger, the new or surviving corporation would not be able to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for the issuance of a license;\n\n2. The effect of the merger would lessen competition substantially or tend to create a monopoly in insurance, prepaid hospital, medical and surgical services plans, or health care benefit plans in this Commonwealth;\n\n3. The financial condition of any party to the merger might jeopardize the financial stability of the new or surviving corporation, or prejudice the interest of the subscribers;\n\n4. Any plans or proposals of the new or surviving corporation to liquidate the new or surviving corporation, sell its assets or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to the subscribers and not in the public interest;\n\n5. The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the new or surviving corporation are such that it would not be in the interest of the subscribers and of the public to permit the merger; or\n\n6. After the change of control, the new or surviving corporation's surplus to subscribers would not be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities or adequate to its financial needs.\n\nC. The provisions of subsection B notwithstanding, the Commission has the authority to merge two nonstock corporations licensed under this chapter where it finds that (i) one of the corporations is insolvent or is in such condition that its further transaction of business in this Commonwealth is hazardous to subscribers and the public, (ii) that the merger of such nonstock corporation into another nonstock corporation licensed under this chapter is desirable for the protection of its subscribers, and that such merger of such nonstock corporation is in the public interest, and (iii) that an emergency exists, and if the board of directors of the insolvent or financially hazardous nonstock corporation to be merged approves a plan of merger of such nonstock corporation into another nonstock corporation licensed under this chapter, compliance with the requirements of § 13.1-895 shall be dispensed with as to such nonstock corporation and the approval by the Commission of such plan of merger shall be the equivalent of approval of two-thirds of the members for all purposes of Article 11 (§ 13.1-893.1 et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 13.1. The Commission shall provide that prompt notice of its findings, and plan of merger be sent to the members of record of such corporation for the purpose of providing such members an opportunity to challenge the findings of the Commission and the plan of merger. The Commission's findings and plan of merger shall become final if a hearing before the Commission is not requested by any member in a written request delivered to the Commission within fifteen days after the notice specified herein is sent.\n\n1986, c. 562.",

These terms and conditions shall not discriminate unreasonably against or among health care providers. No hospital, physician or type of provider listed in § 38.2-4221 willing to meet the terms and conditions offered to it or him shall be excluded. Differences in prices among hospitals or other institutional providers produced by a process of individual negotiations with the providers or based on market conditions, or price differences among providers in different geographical areas shall not be deemed unreasonable discrimination.

This right of selection extends to and includes pharmacies that are nonpreferred providers and that have previously notified the corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager, by facsimile or otherwise, of their agreement to accept reimbursement for their services at rates applicable to pharmacies that are preferred providers, including any copayment consistently imposed by the corporation, as payment in full. Each corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager shall permit prompt electronic or telephonic transmittal of the reimbursement agreement by the pharmacy and ensure payment verification to the pharmacy of the terms of reimbursement. In no event shall any person receiving a covered pharmacy benefit from a nonpreferred provider that has submitted a reimbursement agreement be responsible for amounts that may be charged by the nonpreferred provider in excess of the copayment and the corporation's reimbursement applicable to all of its preferred pharmacy providers.\n\nB. No such corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager shall impose upon any person receiving pharmaceutical benefits furnished under any such contract:\n\n1. Any copayment, fee or condition that is not equally imposed upon all individuals in the same benefit category, class or copayment level, whether or not such benefits are furnished by pharmacists who are nonpreferred providers;\n\n2. Any monetary penalty that would affect or influence any such person's choice of pharmacy; or\n\n3. Any reduction in allowable reimbursement for pharmacy services related to utilization of pharmacists who are nonpreferred providers.\n\nC. For purposes of this section, a prohibited condition or penalty shall include, without limitation: (i) denying immediate access to electronic claims filing to a pharmacy that is a nonpreferred provider and that has complied with subsection D or (ii) requiring a person receiving pharmacy benefits to make payment at point of service, except to the extent such conditions and penalties are similarly imposed on preferred providers.\n\nD. Any pharmacy that wishes to be covered by this section shall, if requested to do so in writing by a corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager, within 30 days of the pharmacy's receipt of the request, execute and deliver to the corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager the direct service agreement or preferred provider agreement that the corporation requires all of its preferred providers of pharmacy benefits to execute. Any pharmacy that fails to timely execute and deliver such agreement shall not be covered by this section with respect to that corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager unless and until the pharmacy executes and delivers the agreement. No pharmacy shall be precluded from obtaining a direct service agreement or participating provider agreement for any retail and specialty pharmacy if the pharmacy meets the terms and conditions of participation. Any request by a pharmacy for a direct service agreement or a participating provider agreement shall be acted upon by a corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager within 60 days of receipt of the pharmacy's request or any subsequent submission of supplemental information if requested by the corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager.\n\nE. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies arising out of this section.\n\nF. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of a corporation issuing preferred provider policies or contracts to select a single mail order pharmacy provider as the exclusive provider of pharmacy services that are delivered to the covered person's address by mail, common carrier, or delivery service. The provisions of this section shall not apply to such contracts. As used in this subsection, \"mail order pharmacy provider\" means a pharmacy permitted to conduct business in the Commonwealth whose primary business is to dispense a prescription drug or device under a prescriptive drug order and to deliver the drug or device to a patient primarily by mail, common carrier, or delivery service.\n\n1994, c. 963; 1995, c. 467; 2010, cc. 157, 357; 2021, Sp.

Upon the issuance of a certificate of amendment by the Commission, the conversion shall be effective, such nonstock corporation shall become subject to all of the provisions of this title relating to domestic mutual insurers, and such nonstock corporation shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n\nC. If any nonstock corporation converts from a health services plan organized under this chapter to a domestic mutual insurer, then at least 90 days prior to the effective date of conversion, the nonstock corporation shall comply with § 38.2-316 by filing with the Commission copies of all policies of insurance that it proposes to issue after the effective date of conversion. All subscription contracts issued and outstanding as of the effective date of conversion shall remain in force in accordance with their terms until the expiration or termination of such contracts.\n\nD. No policy of accident and sickness insurance issued by a nonstock corporation after its conversion to a domestic mutual insurer shall deny the policyholder the right to assign his benefit, except that denial may be made where the benefit is 80 percent of covered charges or greater.\n\n1991, c. 87; 1992, c. 473; 1994, c. 294; 1997, cc. 807, 913; 2013, cc. 136, 210.",
