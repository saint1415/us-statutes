The variable rate currently effective when a loan is made and when notification of interest due is furnished;\n\nb. Any increase in the variable rate at least thirty days before the effective date for any loans outstanding forty days before that date; and\n\nc. The increase at the time a loan is made for any loans made during the forty days before the effective date of the increase.

The maximum interest rate for each policy shall be determined at regular intervals at least once every twelve months, but not more frequently than once every three months. At the intervals specified in the policy:\n\na. The rate being charged may be increased whenever the increase as determined under subdivision 2 of this subsection would increase that rate by one-half percent or more per year;\n\nb. The rate being charged shall be reduced whenever the reduction as determined under subdivision 2 of this subsection would decrease that rate by one-half percent or more per year.\n\n6. The insurer shall:\n\na. Notify the policyowner at the time a cash loan is made of the initial interest rate;\n\nb. Notify the policyowner of the initial interest rates on a premium loan as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so after making the loan. Notice need not be given to the policyowner when a further premium loan is added, except as provided in subdivision 6 c below;\n\nc. Send reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rates to policyowners with loans; and\n\nd. Include the substance of the pertinent provisions of subdivisions 1 and 4 of this subsection in the notices required above.\n\n7. No policy shall terminate in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year, and the insurer shall maintain coverage during that policy year until the time at which it would otherwise have terminated if there had been no change during that policy year.\n\n8. The substance of the pertinent provisions of subdivisions 1 and 4 of this subsection shall be set forth in the policies to which they apply.\n\n9. For the purposes of this section:\n\na. The interest rate on policy loans permitted under this section includes the interest rate charged on reinstatement of policy loans for the period during and after any lapse of a policy.\n\nb.

The insurer may deduct from the loan value any indebtedness not already deducted in determining the value of any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year and any interest that may be allowable on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may further provide that if the interest on the loan is not paid when due, it shall be added to the existing loan and shall bear interest at the same rate.\n\nE.

The spouse and any child who is under the age of 19 years or who is a dependent and a full-time student under 25 years of age, or any class of spouses and dependent children, of each insured group member who so elects; and\n\n2. Any other person in whom the insured group member has an insurable interest as defined in §§ 38.2-301 and 38.2-302 as may mutually be agreed upon by the insurer and the group policyholder.\n\nThe amount of insurance on the life of a spouse, child, or other person shall not exceed the amount of insurance for which the insured group member is eligible.\n\nB. A spouse insured under this section shall have the same conversion right to the insurance on his or her life as the insured group member.\n\nC. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 38.2-3331, one certificate may be issued for each insured group member if a statement concerning any spouse's, dependent child's, or other person's coverage is included in the certificate.\n\nD.

Upon request of the insurer, proof of incapacity and dependency shall be furnished to the insurer by the insured group member within 31 days of the child's attainment of the specified age. Subsequent proof may be required by the insurer but not more frequently than annually after the two-year period following the child's attainment of the specified age. The insurer shall be allowed to charge a premium at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to such group policy for such extended coverage.\n\nE. 1. Upon termination of such group coverage of a child, the child shall be entitled to have issued to him by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual life insurance policy without disability or other supplementary benefits, if:\n\na. An application for the individual policy is made, and the first premium paid to the insurer, within 31 days after such termination; and\n\nb. The individual policy, at the option of such person, is on any one of the forms then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for, except that the group policy may exclude the option to elect term insurance;\n\nc. The individual policy is in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of such termination, less the amount of any life insurance for which such person becomes eligible under the same or any other group policy within 31 days after such termination, provided that any amount of insurance which has matured on or before the date of such termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments or in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this provision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of such termination; and\n\nd. The premium on the individual policy is at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which such person then belongs, and to the individual age attained on the effective date of the individual policy.\n\n2. Subject to the same conditions set forth above, the conversion privilege shall be available (i) to a surviving dependent, if any, at the death of the group member, with respect to the coverage under the group policy which terminates by reason of such death, and (ii) to the dependent of the group member upon termination of coverage of the dependent, while the group member remains insured under the group policy, by reason of the dependent ceasing to be a qualified family member under the group policy.\n\n1960, c. 272, § 38.1-472.1; 1976, c. 111; 1980, c. 110; 1984, c. 364; 1985, c. 28; 1986, c. 562; 1995, c. 259; 1998, c. 154; 2010, cc. 227, 374; 2012, cc. 476, 507; 2023, cc. 148, 149.",
