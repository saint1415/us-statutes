Protect policyholders and the public against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates;\n\n2. Encourage independent action by insurers and reasonable price competition among insurers as the most effective way to produce rates that conform to the standards of subdivision 1;\n\n3. Provide formal regulatory controls for use if independent action and price competition fail;\n\n4. Authorize cooperative action among insurers in the rate making process, and regulate such cooperation in order to prevent practices that tend to create monopoly or to lessen or destroy competition;\n\n5. Provide rates that are responsive to competitive market conditions and improve the availability of insurance in this Commonwealth; and\n\n6. Regulate the business of insurance in a manner that will preclude application of federal antitrust laws.\n\n1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.29; 1986, c. 562.",

All rates and all changes and amendments to rates to which this chapter applies for use in this Commonwealth shall consider loss experience and other factors within Virginia if relevant and actuarially sound, provided that other data, including countrywide, regional, or other state data, may be considered where such data is relevant and where a sound actuarial basis exists for considering data other than Virginia-specific data.\n\n1. No rate shall be held to be excessive unless it is unreasonably high for the insurance provided and a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which the rate applies.\n\n2. No rate shall be held inadequate unless it is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and (i) continued use of it would endanger solvency of the insurer or (ii) use of the rate by the insurer has or, if continued, will have the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly.\n\n3. No rate shall be unfairly discriminatory if a different rate is charged for the same coverage and the rate differential (i) is based on sound actuarial principles or (ii) is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience.\n\nB. 1. In determining whether rates comply with the standards of subsection A, separate consideration shall be given to (i) past and prospective loss experience within and outside this Commonwealth, (ii) conflagration or catastrophe hazards, (iii) a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, (iv) dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, (v) past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this Commonwealth, (vi) the loss reserving practices, standards and procedures utilized by the insurer, (vii) investment income earned or realized by insurers from their unearned premium and loss reserve and the Commission may give separate consideration to investment income earned on surplus funds, and (viii) all other relevant factors within and outside this Commonwealth. When actual experience or data does not exist, the Commission may consider estimates.\n\n2. In the case of fire insurance rates, consideration shall be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during a period of not less than the most recent five-year period for which such experience is available.\n\n3. In the case of workers' compensation insurance rates for volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel, the rates shall be calculated based upon the combined experience of both volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel and paid firefighters or paid emergency medical services personnel, so that the resulting rate is the same for both volunteer and paid members, but in no event shall resulting premiums be less than $40 per year for any volunteer firefighter or volunteer emergency medical services personnel.\n\n4. In the case of uninsured motorist coverage required by subsection A of § 38.2-2206, consideration shall be given to all sums distributed by the Commission from the Uninsured Motorists Fund in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 30 (§ 38.2-3000 et seq.).\n\nC. For the classes of insurance to which this chapter applies, including insurance against contingent, consequential and indirect losses as defined in § 38.2-133 (i) the systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group for any class of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination of insurance for which separate expense provisions are applicable, and (ii) risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that establish standards for measuring variations in hazards, expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference between risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, except as permitted by § 38.2-1908, each member of a rate service organization shall use the uniform classification system, uniform experience rating plan, and uniform statistical plan of its designated rate service organization in the provision of insurance defined in § 38.2-119.\n\nD. No insurer shall use any information pertaining to any motor vehicle conviction or accident to produce increased or surcharged rates above their filed manual rates for individual risks for a period longer than 36 months. This period shall begin no later than 12 months after the date of the conviction or accident.\n\nE. Each authorized insurer subject to the provisions of this chapter may file with the Commission an expense reduction plan that permits variations in expense provisions. Such filing may contain provisions permitting agents to reduce their commission resulting in an appropriate reduction in premium. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require an agent to reduce a commission, nor may an insurer unreasonably refuse to reduce a premium due to a commission reduction as permitted by its filed expense reduction plan.\n\n1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.33; 1975, c. 155; 1977, c. 415; 1981, c. 243; 1982, c. 226; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 697; 1991, c. 104; 1993, c. 985; 1996, c. 250; 2002, c. 145; 2015, cc. 502, 503.",

No insurer may increase its insured's premium or may charge points to its insured where the operator causing the accident is a principal operator insured under a separate policy. Any insurer increasing a premium or charging points as a result of a motor vehicle accident shall notify the named insured in writing and in the same notification shall inform the named insured that he may appeal the decision of the insurer to the Commissioner if he feels his premium has increased or he has been charged points as a result of a motor vehicle accident without just cause. Such notice shall include the requirements that the appeal be in writing and made within 60 days of receipt of the notice of any premium increase adjustment or of any point charge resulting from a motor vehicle accident.\n\nB. An appeal of a premium increase or of a point charge by the named insured shall be requested in writing within sixty days of receipt of the notice of any premium adjustment or of any point charge resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Upon receipt of the request, the Commissioner shall promptly initiate a review to determine whether the premium increase or the point charge is justified. The premium increase or the point charge shall remain in full force and effect until the Commissioner rules that the premium be adjusted or the point charge be removed because it is not justified, or because the point charge was not assigned in accord with the insurer's filed rating plan, and so notifies the insurer and the insured. Upon receipt of the ruling, the insurer shall promptly refund any premiums paid as a direct result of the premium increase or the point charge, and shall adjust future billings to reflect the Commissioner's ruling.\n\nC. No insurer shall assign points under a safe-driver insurance policy to any vehicle other than the vehicle customarily driven by the operator responsible for incurring points.\n\nD. If an insured is a law-enforcement officer, as defined in § 9.1-101, no insurer may increase such insured's personal insurance premium or may charge points under a safe driver insurance plan to such insured as a result of an accident which occurred in the course of the insured's employment as a law-enforcement officer while the insured was driving a motor vehicle provided by the employing law-enforcement agency and was engaged in a law-enforcement activity at the time of such accident.\n\n1981, c. 243, § 38.1-279.33:1; 1986, c. 562; 1990, cc. 275, 960; 1994, c. 925; 2016, c. 558.",

An insurer filing such subclassifications must certify to the Commission that the data it produces can be reported in a manner consistent with the uniform statistical plan and uniform classification system of its designated rate service organization.\n\n1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.36; 1976, c. 275; 1982, c. 201; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 697; 1990, c. 596; 1993, c. 985.",

If the Commission suspends a rate under this provision, it shall hold a hearing within fifteen business days after issuing the order suspending the rate unless the right to a hearing is waived by the insurer.

Where the information requested pursuant to an investigative demand may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, or from a compilation, abstract, or summary based therein, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the Attorney General as for the party from whom such information is requested, it shall be sufficient for that party to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford the Attorney General, or other individuals properly designated by the Attorney General, reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries.

Any natural person who neglects or refuses (i) to attend and testify, (ii) to answer any lawful inquiry, or (iii) to produce documents or things, if in his power to do so, in obedience of an investigative demand or lawful request of the Attorney General or those properly authorized by the Attorney General, pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of § 38.2-218. Any natural person who commits perjury, false swearing, or contempt in answering or failing to answer, or in producing a document or thing or failing to do so in accordance with an investigative demand or lawful request by the Attorney General, pursuant to this section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction therefor by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment in jail for not more than one year, or both.\n\nJ. In any investigation brought by the Attorney General pursuant to this chapter, no individual shall be excused from attending, testifying or producing documentary material, objects, or intangible things in obedience to an investigative demand or under order of the Commission on the ground that the testimony, document, or thing required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to any penalty. No testimony or other information compelled either by the Attorney General or under order of the Commission or a court or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information may be used against the individual or witness in any criminal case. However, he may be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing any document or thing or failing to do so in accordance with the demand of the Attorney General or the Commission. If an individual refuses to testify or produce any document or thing after being granted immunity from criminal prosecution and after being ordered to testify or produce any document or thing as authorized by this section, he may be found to be in civil contempt by a court of competent jurisdiction and incarcerated until such time as he purges himself of contempt by testifying, producing such document or thing, or presenting a written statement as ordered. Such finding of contempt shall not prevent the Attorney General from instituting other appropriate contempt proceedings against any person who violates any of the provisions of this section.\n\nK. It shall be the duty of all public state and local officials, their employees, and all other persons to render and furnish to the Attorney General or his designee, when so requested, all information and assistance in their possession or within their power. Any officer participating in such inquiry and any person examined as a witness upon such inquiry who discloses to any person other than the Attorney General the name of any witness examined or any other information obtained upon such inquiry, except as so directed by the Attorney General, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the sanctions prescribed in subsection I of this section. Such inquiry may upon written authorization by the Attorney General be made public.\n\nL. The Attorney General may recommend rules and regulations to implement and carry out the provisions of this section. All such rules and regulations shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.\n\nM.

So far as reasonably necessary for any examination under subsection A of this section, the Commission may examine the accounts, records, documents or evidence of transactions, so far as they relate to the examinee, of any (i) officer, (ii) manager, (iii) general agent, (iv) employee, (v) person who has executive authority over or is in charge of any segment of the examinee's affairs, (vi) person controlling or having a contract under which he has the right to control the examinee whether exclusively or with others, (vii) person who is under the control of the examinee, or (viii) person who is under the control of a person who controls or has a right to control the examinee whether exclusively or with others.\n\nC. On demand every examinee under subsection A of this section shall make available to the Commission for examination any of its own accounts, records, documents or evidences of transactions and any of those of the persons listed in subsection B of this section.\n\nD. The Commission may examine every licensed rate service organization at intervals established by the Commission.\n\nE. 1. Instead of all or part of an examination under subsections A and B of this section, or in addition to it, the Commission may order an independent audit by certified public accountants or actuarial evaluation by actuaries approved by it of any person subject to the examination requirement. Any accountant or actuary selected shall be subject to standards respecting conflicts of interest used by the Commission. Any audit or evaluation under this subsection shall be subject to subsections H through O of this section, so far as appropriate.\n\n2. Instead of all or part of an examination under this section, the Commission may accept the report of an audit already made by certified public accountants or actuarial evaluation by actuaries approved by it, or the report of an examination made by the insurance department of another state.\n\nF. [Reserved.]\n\nG. An examination may cover comprehensively all aspects of the examinee's affairs and condition. The Commission shall determine the exact nature and scope of each examination, and in doing so shall take into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to (i) the length of time the examinee has been operating, (ii) the length of time it has been licensed in this Commonwealth, (iii) the nature of the services provided, (iv) the nature of the accounting records available and (v) the nature of examinations performed elsewhere.\n\nH. For each examination under this section, the Commission shall issue an order stating the scope of the examination and designating the examiner in charge. On demand a copy of the order shall be exhibited to the examinee.\n\nI. Any examiner authorized by the Commission shall, so far as necessary for the purposes of the examination, have access at all reasonable hours to the premises and to any books, records, files, securities, documents or property of the examinee and to those of persons under subsection B of this section so far as they relate to the affairs of the examinee.\n\nJ. The officers, employees and agents of the examinee and of persons under subsection B of this section shall comply with every reasonable request of the examiners for assistance in any matter relating to the examination. No person shall obstruct or interfere with the examination in any way other than by legal process.\n\nK. If the Commission finds the accounts or records to be inadequate for proper examination of the condition and affairs of the examinee or improperly kept or posted, it may employ experts to rewrite, post or balance them at the expense of the examinee.\n\nL. The examiner in charge of an examination shall make a proposed report of the examination that shall include the information and analysis as is ordered in subsection H of this section, together with the examiner's recommendations. At the discretion of the examiner in charge, preparation of the proposed report may include conferences with the examinee or its representatives. The proposed report shall remain confidential until filed under subsection M of this section.\n\nM. The Commission shall serve a copy of the proposed report upon the examinee. Within twenty days after service, the examinee may serve upon the Commission a written demand for a hearing on the contents of the report. If a hearing is demanded the Commission shall give notice and hold a hearing, and on demand by the examinee the hearing shall be informal and private. The Commission shall adopt the report with any necessary modifications and file it for public inspection, or it may order a new examination within either (i) sixty days after the hearing or (ii) if no hearing is demanded, sixty days after the last day on which the examinee might have demanded a hearing.\n\nN. The Commission shall forward a copy of the examination report to the examinee immediately upon adoption, except that if the proposed report is adopted without change, the Commission need only so notify the examinee.\n\nO. The examinee shall furnish copies of the adopted report to each member of its board of directors or other governing board.\n\nP. The Commission may furnish, without cost or at a price to be determined by it, a copy of the adopted report to the insurance commissioner of any jurisdiction in which the examinee is licensed and to any other interested person in this Commonwealth or elsewhere.\n\nQ. In any proceeding by or against the examinee or any officer or agent of the examinee, the examination report as adopted by the Commission shall be admissible as evidence of the facts stated in the examination report. In any proceeding by or against the examinee the facts asserted in any report properly admitted in evidence shall be presumed to be true in the absence of contrary evidence.\n\nR. The reasonable costs of an examination under this section shall be paid by the examinee except as provided in subsection U of this section. The costs shall include the salary and expenses of each examiner and any other expenses directly apportioned to the examination.\n\nS. The amount payable under subsection R of this section shall become due ten days after the examinee has been served a detailed account of the costs.\n\nT. The Commission may require any examinee, before or during an examination, to deposit with the State Treasurer any deposits the Commission considers necessary to pay the cost of the examination. Any deposit and any payment made under subsections R and S of this section shall be credited to the special fund of the Bureau of Insurance.\n\nU. On the examinee's request or on its own motion, the Commission may pay all or part of the costs of an examination whenever it finds that, because of the frequency of examinations or other factors, imposition of the costs would place an unreasonable burden on the examinee. The Commission shall include in its annual report information about any instance in which it applied this subsection.\n\nV. Deposits and payments under subsections R through U of this section shall not be considered to be a tax or license fee within the meaning of any law. If any other state charges a per diem fee for examination of examinees domiciled in this Commonwealth, any examinee domiciled in that other state shall pay the same fee when examined by the Commission.\n\n1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.53; 1986, c. 562.",
