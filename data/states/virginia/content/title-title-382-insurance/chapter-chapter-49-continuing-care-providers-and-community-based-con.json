A provider shall maintain in escrow with a bank or trust company, or other escrow agent approved by the Commission, all entrance fees or portions thereof in excess of $1,000 per person received by the provider prior to the date the resident is permitted to occupy a unit in the facility. Funds or assets deposited therein shall be kept and maintained in an account separate and apart from the provider's business accounts. For the purposes of this section only, the term \"entrance fee\" shall include within its meaning any advanced payment or series of advanced payments totaling $5,000 or more and the term \"provider\" shall include any person or entity that would be included in the definition thereof in § 38.2-4900 if such fee of $5,000 or more constituted an entrance fee for the purposes of the definition of \"continuing care\" in § 38.2-4900.\n\nB. All funds or assets deposited in the escrow account shall remain the property of the prospective resident until released to the provider in accordance with this section. The funds or assets shall not be subject to any liens, judgments, garnishments or creditor's claims against the provider or facility. The escrow agreement may provide that charges by the escrow agent may be deducted from the funds or assets if such provision is disclosed in the disclosure statement.\n\nC. All funds or assets deposited in escrow pursuant to this section shall be released to the provider when the provider presents to the escrow agent evidence that a unit has been occupied by the resident or a unit of the type reserved is available for immediate occupancy by the resident or prospective resident on whose behalf the fee was received.\n\nD. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all funds or assets deposited in escrow pursuant to this section shall be released according to the terms of the escrow agreement to the prospective resident from whom it was received (i) if such funds or assets have not been released within three years after placement in escrow or within three years after construction has started, whichever is later (but in any event within six years after placement in escrow unless specifically approved by the Commission), or within such longer period as determined appropriate by the Commission in writing, (ii) if the prospective resident dies before occupying a unit, (iii) if the construction of a facility, not yet operating is stopped indefinitely before the facility is completed or (iv) upon rescission of the contract pursuant to provisions in the contract or in this chapter. If construction of the unit to be reserved has not started within three years after the deposit of funds or assets into an escrow account, the prospective resident may require the return of such funds or assets unless the Commission determines that construction will begin in a reasonable period of time and the extension of such three-year period is appropriate. However, funds or assets subject to release under item (i) of this subsection or under subsection C of this section may be held in escrow for an additional period at the mutual consent of the provider and the prospective resident; however, the prospective resident may consent to such additional period only after his deposit has been held in escrow for at least two years. Item (i) above shall not apply if fees are refundable within thirty days of request for refund.\n\nE. Unless otherwise specified in the escrow agreement, funds or assets in an escrow account pursuant to this section may be held in the form received or if invested shall be invested in instruments authorized for the investment of public funds as set forth in Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et seq.) of Title 2.2 and not in default as to principal or interest.\n\nF. This section shall not apply to entrance fees for initial occupancy of units under construction on June 30, 1986.\n\nG. This section shall not apply to application or reservation fees whether or not such fees are considered to be a portion of the entrance fee, provided such application or reservation fees are not in excess of $1,000 per person.\n\n1986, c. 598, § 38.1-959.1.",

Show the value of all property transferred, including donations, subscriptions, fees and any other amounts paid or payable by, or on behalf of, the resident or residents.\n\n3. Specify all services which are to be provided by the provider to each resident including, in detail, all items that each resident will receive and whether the items will be provided for a designated time period or for life. Such items may include, but are not limited to, food, shelter, nursing care, drugs, burial and incidentals.\n\n4. Describe the physical and mental health and financial conditions upon which the provider may require the resident to relinquish his space in the designated facility.\n\n5. Describe the physical and mental health and financial conditions required for a person to continue as a resident.\n\n6. Describe the circumstances under which the resident will be permitted to remain in the facility in the event of financial difficulties of the resident.\n\n7. State (i) the current fees that would be charged if the resident marries while at the designated facility, (ii) the terms concerning the entry of a spouse to the facility and (iii) the consequences if the spouse does not meet the requirements for entry.\n\n8. Provide that the provider shall not cancel any continuing care contract with any resident without good cause. Good cause shall be limited to: (i) proof that the resident is a danger to himself or others; (ii) nonpayment by the resident of a monthly or periodic fee; (iii) repeated conduct by the resident that interferes with other residents' quiet enjoyment of the facility; (iv) persistent refusal to comply with reasonable written rules and regulations of the facility; (v) a material misrepresentation made intentionally or recklessly by the resident in his application for residency, or related materials, regarding information which, if accurately provided, would have resulted in either a failure of the resident to qualify for residency or a material increase in the cost of providing to the resident the care and services provided under the contract; or (vi) material breach by the resident of the terms and conditions of the continuing care contract. If a provider seeks to cancel a contract and terminate a resident's occupancy, the provider shall give the resident written notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within a reasonable period, whatever conduct is alleged to warrant the cancellation of the agreement. Nothing herein shall operate to relieve the provider from duties under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (§ 55.1-1200 et seq.) when seeking to terminate a resident's occupancy.\n\n9. Provide in clear and understandable language, in print no smaller than the largest type used in the body of the contract, the terms governing the refund of any portion of the entrance fee and the terms under which such fee can be used by the provider.\n\n10. State the terms under which a contract is cancelled by the death of the resident. The contract may contain a provision to the effect that, upon the death of the resident, the money paid for the continuing care of such resident shall be considered earned and become the property of the provider.\n\n11. Provide for at least 30 days' advance notice to the resident, before any change in fees, charges or the scope of care or services may be effective, except for changes required by state or federal assistance programs.\n\n12. Provide that charges for care paid in one lump sum shall not be increased or changed during the duration of the agreed upon care, except for changes required by state or federal assistance programs.\n\nB. A resident shall have the right to rescind a continuing care contract, without penalty or forfeiture, within seven days after making an initial deposit or executing the contract. A resident shall not be required to move into the facility designated in the contract before the expiration of the seven-day period.\n\nC. If a resident dies before occupying the facility, or is precluded through illness, injury or incapacity from becoming a resident under the terms of the continuing care contract, the contract is automatically rescinded and the resident or his legal representative shall receive a full refund of all money paid to the provider, except those costs specifically incurred by the provider at the request of the resident and set forth in writing in a separate addendum, signed by both parties to the contract.\n\nD. No standard continuing care contract form shall be used in this Commonwealth until it has been submitted to the Commission. If the Commission determines that the contract does not comply with the provisions of this chapter, it shall have the right to take action pursuant to § 38.2-4931 to prevent its use. The failure of the Commission to object to or disapprove of any contract shall not be evidence that the contract does or does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. However, individualized amendments to any standard form need not be filed with the Commission.\n\n1985, c. 554, § 38.1-960; 1986, cc. 562, 598; 2012, cc. 208, 303.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all funds or assets deposited in escrow pursuant to this section shall be released according to the terms of the escrow agreement to the prospective participant from whom it was received (i) if such funds or assets have not been released within three years after placement in escrow (but in any event within six years after placement in escrow unless specifically approved by the Commission) or within such longer period as determined appropriate by the Commission in writing, (ii) if the prospective participant dies before enrolling and receiving services from the program, or (iii) upon rescission of the CBCC contract pursuant to provisions in the CBCC contract or in this article. Funds or assets subject to release under clause (i) of this subsection or under subsection C may be held in escrow for an additional period at the mutual consent of the provider and the prospective participant; however, the prospective participant may consent to such additional period only after his deposit has been held in escrow for at least two years. Clause (i) of this subsection shall not apply if fees are refundable within 30 days of request for refund.\n\nE. Unless otherwise specified in the escrow agreement, funds or assets in an escrow account pursuant to this section may be held in the form received or if invested shall be invested in instruments authorized for the investment of public funds as set forth in Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et seq.) of Title 2.2 and not in default as to principal or interest.\n\nF.

Good cause shall be limited to (i) proof that the participant is a danger to himself or others; (ii) nonpayment by the participant of a monthly or periodic fee; (iii) repeated conduct by the participant that interferes with other participants' quiet enjoyment of a facility or service, if applicable; (iv) persistent refusal to comply with reasonable written rules and regulations of the program; (v) a material misrepresentation made intentionally or recklessly by the participant in his application for participation in the program, or related materials, regarding information which, if accurately provided, would have resulted in either a failure of the participant to qualify for participation or a material increase in the cost of providing to the participant the care and services provided under the CBCC contract; or (vi) material breach by the participant of the terms and conditions of the community-based continuing care contract. If a CBCC provider seeks to cancel a CBCC contract and terminate a participant's participation, the provider shall give the participant written notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within a reasonable period, whatever conduct is alleged to warrant the cancellation of the CBCC contract;\n\n7.

If a participant dies before initiating the program, or is precluded through illness, injury, or incapacity from becoming a participant under the terms of the community-based continuing care contract, the contract is automatically rescinded and the participant or his legal representative shall receive a full refund of all money paid to the CBCC provider, except those costs specifically incurred by the CBCC provider at the request of the participant and set forth in writing in a separate addendum, signed by both parties, to the contract.\n\nD. No standard community-based continuing care contract form shall be used in the Commonwealth until it has been submitted to the Commission. If the Commission determines that the CBCC contract does not comply with the provisions of this article, it shall have the right to take action pursuant to § 38.2-4931 to prevent its use. The failure of the Commission to object to or disapprove of any CBCC contract shall not be evidence that the contract does or does not comply with the provisions of this article.
