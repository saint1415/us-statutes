      "text": "A. Each domestic, foreign, and alien insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth shall file with the Commission annually, on or before March 1, an annual statement showing its financial condition on December 31 of the previous year. The annual statement shall be considered filed on the date the statement was sent by mail as shown by the postmark or on the date it is received electronically by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in accordance with subsection D. The Commission shall prescribe the type of filing required for each type of insurer. The annual statement shall contain a detailed report of the insurer's assets and liabilities, the investment of its assets, its income and disbursements during the previous year, and all other information which the Commission considers necessary to secure a full and accurate knowledge of the affairs and condition of the insurer. The annual statement of every domestic or foreign insurer shall be signed by at least two of its principal officers subject to § 38.2-1304. No publication of the annual statement shall be required.\n\nB. The annual statement of an alien insurer shall relate only to its transactions and affairs in the United States unless the Commission requires otherwise. The annual statement shall be verified by the alien insurer's United States manager, assistant manager, or by any of its duly authorized officers.\n\nC. The Commission may prescribe the form of the annual statement and supplemental schedules and exhibits to include additional copies in machine-readable format, and may vary the form for different types of insurers. However, as far as practicable, the form for annual statements, supplementary schedules, and exhibits shall be the same as other such forms in general use in the United States. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission, such annual statements shall be prepared using an annual statement convention blank developed by the NAIC. The annual statement, and supplementary schedules and exhibits required by this section, shall be prepared in accordance with the appropriate annual statement instructions and the accounting practices and procedures manuals adopted by the NAIC, or any other successor publications.\n\nD. Each insurer that is authorized to transact insurance in this Commonwealth shall annually on or before March 1 of each year, file electronically with the NAIC a copy of its annual statement convention blank, along with such additional filings as prescribed by the Commission for the preceding year. The information filed with the NAIC shall be in the same format and scope as that required by the Commission and shall include any actuarial certification required by the Commission. Any amendments and addenda to the annual statement filing subsequently filed with the Commission shall also be filed with the NAIC. However, an insurer may apply to the Commission for an exemption from this subsection.\n\nE. Foreign insurers that are domiciled in a state, which has a law substantially similar to subsection D of this section, shall be deemed to be in compliance with subsection D of this section.\n\nCode 1950, §§ 38-122, 38-516; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-159; 1986, c. 562; 1990, c. 240; 1991, c. 312; 1992, c. 588; 1994, c. 308; 2009, c. 602.",

The Commission shall establish deadlines for filing these additional reports, exhibits or statements and may require verification by any officers of the insurer designated by the Commission.\n\nB. The Commission may require a domestic, foreign or alien insurer that is authorized to transact insurance in this Commonwealth to file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) a copy of the insurer's financial statement required to be filed pursuant to § 38.2-1301, on a quarterly basis. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission, all such financial statements, whether filed with the Commission or the NAIC, shall be prepared in accordance with applicable provisions of the annual statement instructions and the accounting practices and procedures manuals adopted by the NAIC, or any successor publications.

      "heading": "Material transaction disclosures",
      "text": "A. Every insurer domiciled in this Commonwealth shall file a report with the Commission disclosing material acquisitions and dispositions of assets or material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements unless such acquisitions and dispositions of assets or material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements have been submitted to the Commission for review, approval or information purposes pursuant to other provisions of Title 38.2 or the rules and regulations of the Commission.\n\n1. The report required by this subsection is due within fifteen days after the end of the calendar month in which any of the foregoing transactions occur.\n\n2. One complete copy of the report, including any exhibits or other attachments filed as part thereof, shall be filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners unless the insurer has applied for and has been granted an exemption from this requirement by the Commission.\n\nB. All reports obtained by or disclosed to the Commission pursuant to this section, shall be given confidential treatment, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be made public by the Commission, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or any other person without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the Commission, after giving the insurer which would be affected thereby, notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders, or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event the Commission may publish all or any part thereof in such manner as it may deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission may at its discretion disclose such reports to (i) a regulatory official of any state or country; (ii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliate or its subsidiary; or (iii) a law-enforcement authority of any state or country. Any such disclosure by the Commission shall not constitute a waiver of confidentiality of any such report.\n\nC. No acquisitions or dispositions of assets need be reported pursuant to subsection A if the acquisitions or dispositions are not material. For purposes of this section, a material acquisition, or the aggregate of any series of related acquisitions during any thirty-day period, or disposition, or the aggregate of any series of related dispositions during any thirty-day period, is one that is nonrecurring and not in the ordinary course of business and involves more than five percent of the reporting insurer's total admitted assets as reported in its most recent statutory statement filed with the Commission.\n\n1. Asset acquisitions subject to this section include every purchase, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, succession, or other acquisition other than the construction or development of real property by or for the reporting insurer or the acquisition of materials for such purpose.\n\n2. Asset dispositions subject to this section include every sale, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, mortgage, pledge or hypothecation, assignment, whether for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, abandonment, destruction, or other disposition.\n\n3. The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material acquisition or disposition of assets:\n\na. Date of the transaction;\n\nb. Manner of acquisition or disposition;\n\nc. Description of the assets involved;\n\nd. Nature and amount of the consideration given or received;\n\ne. Purpose of, or reason for, the transaction;\n\nf. Manner by which the amount of consideration was determined;\n\ng. Gain or loss recognized or realized as a result of the transaction; and\n\nh. Name of all persons from whom the assets were acquired or to whom they were disposed.\n\n4. Insurers are required to report material acquisitions and dispositions on a nonconsolidated basis unless the insurer is part of a consolidated group of insurers which utilizes a pooling arrangement or 100 percent reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurer's reserves and such insurer ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement and the net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent of the insurer's capital and surplus.\n\nD. No nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements need be reported pursuant to this section if the nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions are not material. For purposes of this section, a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision is one that affects for property and casualty business, including accident and health business when written as such, more than fifty percent of an insurer's ceded written premium, or for life, annuity and accident and health business, more than fifty percent of the total reserve credit taken for business ceded, on an annualized basis as indicated in the insurer's most recently filed statutory statement; however, no filing is required if the insurer's ceded written premium or the total reserve credit taken for business ceded represents, on an annualized basis, less than ten percent of direct plus assumed written premium or ten percent of the statutory reserve requirement prior to any cession, respectively.\n\n1. Subject to the foregoing criteria, a report is to be filed without regard to which party has initiated the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance whenever one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\na. The entire cession has been cancelled, nonrenewed or revised and ceded indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves after any nonrenewal, cancellation or revision represent less than fifty percent of the comparable reserves that would have been ceded had the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision not occurred;\n\nb. An authorized or accredited reinsurer has been replaced on an existing cession by an unauthorizing reinsurer; or\n\nc. Collateral requirements previously established for unauthorized reinsurers have been reduced; e.g., the requirement to collateralize incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim reserves has been waived with respect to one or more unauthorized reinsurers newly participating in an existing cession.\n\nSubject to the materiality criteria, for purposes of the foregoing subdivisions b and c, a report shall be filed if the result of the revision affects more than ten percent of the cession.\n\n2. The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance agreements:\n\na. Effective date of the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision;\n\nb. The description of the transaction with an identification of the initiator thereof;\n\nc. Purpose of, or reason for, the transaction; and\n\nd. If applicable, the identity of the replacement reinsurers.\n\n3. Insurers are required to report all material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements on a nonconsolidated basis unless the insurer is part of a consolidated group of insurers which utilizes a pooling arrangement or 100 percent reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurer's reserves and such insurer ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement and the net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent of the insurer's capital and surplus.\n\n1994, c. 308; 2001, c. 519.",

Every insurer domiciled in the Commonwealth that is required to submit an actuarial opinion pursuant to subsection A shall annually submit an actuarial opinion summary, also written by the insurer's appointed actuary. Every insurer domiciled in the Commonwealth that is required to submit an actuarial opinion pursuant to subsection A or § 38.2-1367, at the request of the Commission, shall submit underlying work papers and an actuarial report or memorandum that satisfies the minimum standards set forth in the appropriate NAIC annual statement instructions and complies with all additional standards or requirements established by statute or by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section or Article 10 (§ 38.2-1365 et seq.) of Chapter 13. A company licensed but not domiciled in the Commonwealth shall provide such summary, work papers, report, and memorandum upon request of the Commission.

The appointed actuary shall not be liable for damages to any person, other than the insurer and the Commission for any act, error, omission, decision, or conduct with respect to the actuary's opinion, except in cases of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the actuary.\n\nE.

However, this provision shall not be construed to limit the Commission's authority to release the documents to any actuarial board established for counseling or discipline so long as the material is required for the purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings and such board establishes procedures satisfactory to the Commission for preserving the confidentiality of the documents. Moreover, the Commission is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the Commission's official duties.\n\n1.

The Commission may waive or modify submission requirements for a foreign insurer that has been exempted by its domiciliary commissioner from filing an actuarial opinion under a substantially similar law in its state of domicile. The Commission may modify requirements in any year for an insurer that makes application, with good cause shown, for exemption due to the nature of business written or the size and volume of business activity, or because the insurer is under supervision or an order of conservation, or if the imposition of an annual filing requirement would create a financial hardship.\n\n2004, c. 315; 2006, c. 320; 2014, c. 571.",

      "text": "A. Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of subsection C, D, or E or § 38.2-1316.4, provided that the Commission may adopt by regulation pursuant to subsection B of § 38.2-1316.7 specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth any one or more of the following: (i) the valuation of assets or reserve credits, (ii) the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection B of § 38.2-1316.7, and (iii) the circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated.\n\nB. Credit shall be allowed under subdivisions C 1, 2, and 3 only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit shall be allowed under subdivision C 3 or 4 only if the applicable requirements of subsection B of 14VAC5-300-150 of the Virginia Administrative Code have been satisfied.\n\nC. Credit shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer for reinsurance ceded only when the assuming insurer meets one of the following criteria:\n\n1. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is licensed to transact insurance in the Commonwealth.\n\n2. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is accredited as a reinsurer in the Commonwealth. An accredited reinsurer is one which:\n\na. Files with the Commission evidence of its submission to the Commission's jurisdiction;\n\nb. Submits to the Commission's authority to examine its books and records;\n\nc. Is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;\n\nd. Files annually with the Commission a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile or entry and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and\n\ne. Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commission within 90 days of its initial submission.\n\n3. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is domiciled and licensed in or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien insurer, is entered through, a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this statute and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:\n\na. Submits to the authority of the Commission to examine its books and records; and\n\nb. Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million. However, unless specifically required by the Commission, this surplus requirement shall be deemed waived when reinsurance is ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.\n\n4. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution for the payment of the valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commission information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to enable the Commission to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund.\n\na. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States, and in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus amount not less than $20 million, except as provided in subdivision 4 b.\n\nb. At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust.\n\nc. In the case of an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the association's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and in addition, the association shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the association, the incorporated members of which shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and the association shall make available to the Commission an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the association's domiciliary regulator and its independent public accountants.\n\nd. In the case of an association of incorporated underwriters under common administration that complies with the filing requirements contained in subdivision 4 c, and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years, and submits to the Commission's authority to examine its books and records and bears the expense of the examination, and which has aggregate policyholders' surplus of $10 billion; the trust shall be in an amount equal to the association's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the association pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of such association. In addition, the association shall maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the association as additional security for any such liabilities, and each member of the association shall make available to the Commission an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and its independent public accountant.\n\nD. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the Commission as a reinsurer in the Commonwealth and secures its obligations in accordance with the following:\n\n1. In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall:\n\na. Be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 3;\n\nb. Maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the Commission pursuant to regulation;\n\nc. Maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the Commission pursuant to regulation;\n\nd. Agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, appoint the Commission as its agent for service of process in the Commonwealth, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;\n\ne. Agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the Commission, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and\n\nf. Satisfy other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the Commission.\n\n2. In order to be eligible for certification as a certified reinsurer, an association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, in addition to satisfying requirements of subdivision 1, shall satisfy the following requirements:\n\na. The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the Commission to provide adequate protection;\n\nb. The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and\n\nc. Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the Commission an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.\n\n3. The Commission shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the Commission as a certified reinsurer. With regard to determinations of qualified jurisdictions:\n\na. In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the Commission shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the Commission with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the Commission has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the Commission;\n\nb. A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the NAIC Committee Process. The Commission shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the Commission approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the Commission shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations;\n\nc. United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions; and\n\nd. If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the Commission has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.\n\n4. The Commission shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the Commission pursuant to regulation. The Commission shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.\n\n5. A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this subsection at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the Commission. With regard to securing obligations:\n\na. In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the Commission and consistent with the provisions of § 38.2-1316.4, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subdivision C 4, except as otherwise provided in this subsection;\n\nb. If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to subdivision C 4, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subsection or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to subdivision C 4. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the Commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account;\n\nc. The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subdivision C 4 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10 million;\n\nd. With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subsection, if the security is insufficient, the Commission shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due; and\n\ne. For purposes of this subsection, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations. As used in this subsection, the term \"terminated\" means revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status. If the Commission continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.\n\n6. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the Commission has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in the Commonwealth.\n\n7. A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in the Commonwealth may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the Commission shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.\n\nE. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer in accordance with the following:\n\n1. The assuming insurer shall:\n\na. Be domiciled in, or its head office shall be located in, as applicable, a reciprocal jurisdiction identified by the Commission pursuant to this subsection and shall be licensed in such reciprocal jurisdiction;\n\nb. Maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be determined by the Commission in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall maintain minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be determined by the Commission in regulation;\n\nc. Maintain a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, which will be determined by the Commission in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall maintain a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer is domiciled or its head office is located, as applicable, and is licensed;\n\nd. Agree and provide adequate assurance to the Commission, in a form specified by the Commission pursuant to regulation, as follows:\n\n(1) Provide prompt written notice and explanation to the Commission if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subdivision b or c, or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;\n\n(2) Consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth and to the appointment of the Commission as an agent for service of process. The Commission may require that consent for service of process be provided to the Commission and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this subdivision shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;\n\n(3) Consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained;\n\n(4) Include, in each reinsurance agreement, a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and\n\n(5) Confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves the Commonwealth's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the Commission and to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of subsection D of this section and subdivision 2 of § 38.2-1316.4 and as determined by the Commission in regulation;\n\ne. Provide, or its legal successor shall provide, if requested by the Commission, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the Commission, as specified by the Commission in regulation; and\n\nf. Maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth by regulation.\n\nNothing in this subdivision 1 precludes an assuming insurer from providing the Commission with information on a voluntary basis.\n\n2. The assuming insurer's supervisory authority shall confirm to the Commission on an annual basis as of the preceding December 31, or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in subdivisions 1 b and c.\n\n3. The Commission shall create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions. With regard to determinations of reciprocal jurisdictions, the Commission:\n\na. Shall include (i) any non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, is a member state of the European Union; (ii) any United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program; or (iii) any qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the Commission pursuant to subdivision D 3 of § 38.2-1316.2, that is not otherwise described in clause (i) or (ii) and that meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the Commission in regulation;\n\nb. Shall consider including any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the NAIC list published through the NAIC Committee Process. The Commission may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations issued by the Commission; and\n\nc. May remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process set forth in regulations issued by the Commission, except that the Commission shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction described in clause (i) or (ii) of subdivision a. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled or has its home office in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to this section.\n\n4. The Commission shall create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this subsection and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this subsection. The Commission may add an assuming insurer to such list if an NAIC-accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the Commission as required under subdivision 1 d and complies with any additional requirements that the Commission may impose by regulation, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.\n\n5. If the Commission determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subsection, the Commission may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures set forth in regulation.\n\na. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subdivision 2 of § 38.2-1316.4.\n\nb. If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the Commission and consistent with the provisions of subdivision 2 of § 38.2-1316.4.\n\n6. If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.\n\n7. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this article or other applicable law or regulation.\n\n8. Credit may be taken under this subsection only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of (i) the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to subdivision 1 and (ii) the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal. This subdivision does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this subsection, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this article.\n\n9. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement.\n\n10. Nothing in this subsection shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.\n\nF. If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the Commission may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification in accordance with the following:\n\n1. The Commission shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing. The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the Commission's order on hearing, unless:\n\na. The reinsurer waives its right to hearing;\n\nb. The Commission's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subdivision D 6; or\n\nc. The Commission finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the Commission's action.\n\n2. While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with § 38.2-1316.4. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subdivision D 5 or § 38.2-1316.4.\n\nG. A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its concentration risk and diversify its reinsurance program in the following manner:\n\n1. A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the Commission within 30 days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, exceeds 50 percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.\n\n2. A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the Commission within 30 days after ceding to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, more than 20 percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.\n\nH. The trusts described in subdivision C 4 shall be established in a form acceptable to the Commission.\n\n1. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.\n\n2. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.\n\n3. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the Commission.\n\n4. The trust described herein must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer shall have outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.\n\n5. No later than February 28 of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the Commission in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust shall not expire prior to the next following December 31.\n\n1991, c. 264; 1994, c. 647; 2012, c. 539; 2017, c. 477; 2020, c. 208.",

Any licensed insurer that is a member of an insurance holding company system but not subject to registration under this section may be required by the Commission to furnish a copy of the registration statement, or other information filed by the insurer, with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction.\n\nC. Each insurer subject to registration under this section shall file a registration statement on a form provided by the Commission. Such statement shall contain current information on:\n\n1. The capital structure, general financial condition, ownership, and management of the insurer and any person controlling the insurer;\n\n2. The identity of every member of the insurance holding company system;\n\n3. The following agreements in force, continuing relationships and transactions currently outstanding between the insurer and its affiliates:\n\na.

Dividends and other distributions to shareholders; and\n\nh. Consolidated tax allocation agreements;\n\n4. Any pledge of the insurer's stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system;\n\n5. If requested by the Commission, financial statements of or within an insurance holding company system, including all affiliates. Financial statements may include but are not limited to annual audited financial statements filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this subdivision may satisfy the request by providing the Commission with the most recently filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the SEC;\n\n6. Other matters relating to transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates which may be included from time to time in any registration forms adopted or approved by the Commission;\n\n7. Statements that the corporate governance and internal controls are managed under the direction of the insurer's board of directors in a manner consistent with § 13.1-673 or § 13.1-853 as applicable, and that the insurer's officers or senior management have approved, implemented, and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control procedures; and\n\n8. Any other information required by the Commission by rule or regulation.\n\nD. All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.\n\nE. If information is not material for the purposes of this section, it need not be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to subsection C. Unless the Commission prescribes otherwise and except for the purposes of subsections M and N, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of one percent or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of the immediately preceding December 31 shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.\n\nF. Each registered insurer shall report all additional material transactions with affiliates and any material changes in previously reported material transactions with affiliates on amendment forms provided by the Commission. Each insurer shall make its report within 15 days after the end of the month in which it learns of each additional material transaction or material change in material transaction. Subject to § 38.2-1330.1, each insurer shall report to the Commission all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within five business days following their declaration, and such declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:\n\n1. The Commission has approved the payment of such dividend or distribution; or\n\n2. Thirty days after the Commission has received written notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such payment.\n\nEach registered insurer shall also keep current the information required by subsection C by filing an amendment to its registration statement within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the ultimate controlling person of the insurance holding company system.\n\nG. The Commission shall terminate the registration of any insurer that demonstrates it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.\n\nH. The Commission may require or allow two or more affiliated insurers subject to registration under this section to file a consolidated registration statement or consolidated reports amending their consolidated registration statement or their individual registration statements.\n\nI.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, information, or transaction if and to the extent that the Commission by rule, regulation, or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section.\n\nK. Any person may file with the Commission a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming the affiliation. A disclaimer of affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the Commission, within 30 days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed. In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request a hearing. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the Commission or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.\n\nL. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall be appropriate to the nature, scale, and complexity of the operations of the insurance holding company system, and shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner.\n\nM. Except as provided below, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall concurrently file with the registration an annual group capital calculation as directed by the lead state commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC Group Capital Calculation Instructions, which may permit the lead state commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be filled with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system. The following insurance holding company systems are exempt from filing the group capital calculation:\n\n1. An insurance holding company system that has only one insurer within its holding company structure, that only writes business and is only licensed in its domestic state, and that assumes no business from any other insurer.\n\n2. Any insurance holding company system that is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by the Federal Reserve Board. The lead state commissioner shall request the calculation from the Federal Reserve Board under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. However, if the Federal Reserve Board cannot share the calculation with the lead state commissioner, the insurance holding company shall not be exempt from filing the group capital calculation.\n\n3. An insurance holding company system whose non-U.S. group-wide supervisor is located within a reciprocal jurisdiction as described in subsection E of § 38.2-1316.2 that recognizes the U.S. state regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital.\n\n4. An insurance holding system:\n\na. That provides information to the lead state that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide supervisor, who has determined such information is satisfactory to allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook; and\n\nb. Whose non-U.S. group-wide supervisor that is not located in a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the Commission in regulation, the group capital calculation as the worldwide group capital assessment for the U.S. insurance groups that operate in that jurisdiction.\n\nNotwithstanding the exemptions provided for in subdivisions 3 and 4, a lead state commissioner shall require the group capital calculation for U.S. operations of any non-U.S.-based insurance holding company system where, after any necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance market.\n\nNotwithstanding the exemptions provided for in subdivisions 1 through 4, the lead state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria as specified by the Commission in regulation.\n\nIf the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption specified in subdivisions 1 through 4, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.\n\nN. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration and scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall be made to the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system.\n\n1. Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework or to the data year for which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January 1 of the year following the calendar year when such changes are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped in the Framework for the specified data year unless the lead state commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should not be scoped into the Framework for that data year. Insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria shall be considered scoped out of the Framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped into the Framework for that data year.\n\n2. The performance of and filing of the results from a specific year's liquidity stress test shall comply with Framework's instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead state commissioner determinations, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.\n\nO. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for filing shall be a violation of this section.\n\n1973, c. 505, § 38.1-178.2; 1977, c. 414; 1986, c. 562; 1992, c. 588; 2000, c. 46; 2006, c. 577; 2009, c. 717; 2014, c. 309; 2022, c. 113.",

      "heading": "Standards for transactions within an insurance holding company system; adequacy of surplus",
      "text": "A. Transactions within an insurance holding company system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards:\n\n1. The terms shall be fair and reasonable;\n\n2. Agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall include such provisions as required by rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission;\n\n3. Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;\n\n4. Expenses incurred and payments received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;\n\n5. The books, accounts, and records of each party shall disclose clearly and accurately the precise nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties;\n\n6. The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs;\n\n7. If an insurer subject to this article is deemed by the Commission to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by 14VAC5-290 or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation, or a delinquency proceeding, then the Commission may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a deposit held by the Commission or a bond as determined by the insurer at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration of the contract, agreement, or existence of the condition for which the Commission required deposit or bond.\n\nIn determining if a deposit or bond is required, the Commission shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation, or a delinquency proceeding, and a deposit or bond is necessary, the Commission has the discretion to determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond shall be required for a single contract, multiple contracts, or a contract only with a specific person;\n\n8. All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and remain the property of the insurer, are subject to the control of the insurer, are identifiable, and are segregated or readily capable of segregation at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons' records and data. This includes all records and data that are otherwise the property of the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files, premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records, financial records, or similar records within the possession, custody, or control of the affiliate. At the request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may (i) obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's business, (ii) obtain access to the operating systems on which the data is maintained, (iii) obtain the software that runs those systems either through assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise, and (iv) restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance to give the insurer access to all records and data in the event of the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and\n\n9. Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are collected by or held by an affiliate are the exclusive property of the insurer and subject to the control of the insurer. Any right of offset in the event that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.).\n\nB. Transactions described in subdivisions 1 through 7 that involve a domestic insurer and any person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, that are subject to materiality standards contained in such subdivisions may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the Commission in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the Commission may permit, and the Commission has not disapproved it within that period. The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported, within 30 days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the Commission for determination of the type of filing required, if any. Transactions to which this subsection applies, with their materiality standards, are:\n\n1. Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, extensions of credit, or investments, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\na. With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31; or\n\nb. With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of the immediately preceding December 31;\n\n2. Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\na. With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31; or\n\nb. With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of the immediately preceding December 31;\n\n3. Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:\n\na. All reinsurance pooling agreements; and\n\nb. Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the immediately preceding December 31, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;\n\n4. All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and cost-sharing arrangements;\n\n5. Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer, provided, however, that a guarantee that is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this subdivision unless it exceeds the lesser of one-half of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 10 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31. Further, all guarantees that are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this subdivision;\n\n6. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount that, together with its present holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one-half percent of the insurer's surplus to policyholders. The Commission may exempt such a transaction by regulation; and\n\n7. Any material transactions that the Commission determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.\n\nNothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions that, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\nC. In addition:\n\n1. Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this article;\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection A;\n\n3. Not less than one-third of the directors of a domestic insurer, and not less than one-third of the members of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer, shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or entity. At least one such person shall be included in any quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee thereof;\n\n4. The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one or more committees composed solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees shall have responsibility for nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers;\n\n5. The provisions of subdivisions 3 and 4 shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a publicly held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of subdivisions 3 and 4 with respect to such controlling entity; and\n\n6. An insurer may make application to the Commission for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection if the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program, is less than $300 million. An insurer may also make application to the Commission for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The Commission may consider various factors including the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, or ownership or organizational structure of the entity.\n\nD. For purposes of this article, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:\n\n1. The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;\n\n2. The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among different lines of insurance;\n\n3. The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;\n\n4. The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risk;\n\n5. The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;\n\n6. The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;\n\n7. The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's surplus to policyholders;\n\n8. The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio;\n\n9. The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;\n\n10. The adequacy of the insurer's reserves;\n\n11. The quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the reported earnings of the insurer include extraordinary items; and\n\n12. The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The Commission in its judgment may classify any investment as a nonadmitted asset for the purpose of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders.\n\nE. No domestic insurer shall enter into transactions that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that otherwise would be required. If the Commission determines that separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the Commission may exercise its authority under § 38.2-1334.2:2.\n\nF. The Commission, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection B, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection A and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\nG. The Commission shall be notified in writing within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10 percent of such corporation's voting securities.\n\nH. Any affiliate that is party to a contract or agreement described in subdivision B 4 with a domestic insurer shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any supervision, seizure, conservatorship, or receivership proceedings against the insurer and to the authority of any supervisor, conservator, rehabilitator, or liquidator for the insurer appointed pursuant to Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.) for the purpose of interpreting, enforcing, and overseeing the affiliate's obligations under the agreement or contract to perform services for the insurer that are (i) an integral part of the insurer's operation, including management, administrative, accounting, data processing, marketing, underwriting, claims handling, investment, or any other similar functions or (ii) essential to the insurer's ability to fulfill its obligations under insurance policies. The Commission may require that an agreement or contract described in subdivision B 4 for the provision of services described in clause (i) or (ii) specify that the affiliate consents to the jurisdiction as set forth in this subsection.\n\n1973, c. 505, § 38.1-178.3; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 417; 1992, c. 588; 2006, c. 577; 2014, c. 309; 2022, c. 113.",

Except as otherwise provided by law, a domestic insurer shall not declare or pay a dividend or other distribution from any source other than earned surplus without the Commission's prior written approval. For purposes of this section, \"earned surplus\" means an amount equal to the unassigned funds (surplus) of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer filed with the Commission including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets. No domestic insurer shall pay an extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until the earlier of:\n\n1. Thirty days after the Commission has received written notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such payment; or\n\n2. The Commission's approval of such payment.\n\nB. For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (i) 10 percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the immediately preceding December 31, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.\n\nC. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.\n\nD. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the Commission's approval thereof, and such declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:\n\n1. The Commission has approved the payment of such dividend or distribution; or\n\n2. The Commission has not disapproved such payment within the 30-day period described in subsection A.\n\nE. The Commission may limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends by a domestic insurer if the insurer is presently or potentially financially distressed or troubled.

The Commission may order any insurer registered under § 38.2-1329 to produce such records, books, or other information papers in the possession of the insurer or its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this article.\n\nC. To determine compliance with this article, the Commission may order any insurer registered under § 38.2-1329 to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations, or other method.

The Commission may enter into agreements in accordance with subsection C of § 38.2-1333 providing the basis for cooperation between the Commission and the other regulatory agencies and the activities of the supervisory college. Nothing in this section shall delegate to the supervisory college the authority of the Commission to regulate or supervise the insurer or its affiliates within its jurisdiction.\n\n2014, c. 309.",

      "text": "A. The Commission is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this section. However, the Commission may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:\n\n1. Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;\n\n2. Has substantial insurance operations in the United States but not in the Commonwealth; or\n\n3. Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and the Commonwealth, but the Commission has determined pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections B and F that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.\n\nAn insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the Commission make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor pursuant to this section.\n\nB. In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the Commission shall identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The Commission may determine that the Commission is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in the Commonwealth. However, the Commission may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The Commission shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:\n\n1. The place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that holds the largest share of the internationally active insurance group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities;\n\n2. The place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n3. The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n4. Whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system that the Commission determines to be:\n\na. Substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of the Commonwealth; or\n\nb. Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and\n\n5. Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the Commission with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.\n\nHowever, a regulatory official identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in subdivisions 1 through 5, and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.\n\nC. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commission's regulatory authority under this section shall not be impaired. To the extent that the Commission acknowledges a regulatory official from another jurisdiction as a group-wide supervisor and in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in (i) the internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in the Commonwealth holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets, or liabilities or (ii) the Commonwealth being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group, the Commission may make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for such an internationally active insurance group pursuant to subsection B.\n\nD. Pursuant to § 38.2-1332, the Commission is authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to § 38.2-1329 all information necessary to determine whether the Commission may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the Commission may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the Commission, the Commission shall notify the insurer registered pursuant to § 38.2-1329 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have not less than 30 days to provide the Commission with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The Commission shall publish in any manner it considers appropriate and on its website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the Commission has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the Commission.\n\nE. If the Commission is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the Commission is authorized to engage in any of the following group-wide supervision activities:\n\n1. Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:\n\na. The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and\n\nb. Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;\n\n2. Request, from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the Commission's supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:\n\na. Governance, risk assessment, and management;\n\nb. Capital adequacy; and\n\nc. Material intercompany transactions;\n\n3. Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of such internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n4. Communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of § 38.2-1333, through supervisory colleges as set forth in § 38.2-1332.1 or otherwise;\n\n5. Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under § 38.2-1329, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the Commission's role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in the Commonwealth is doing business in the Commonwealth or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in the Commonwealth; and\n\n6. Engage in other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated above, as considered necessary by the Commission.\n\nF. If the Commission acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the NAIC is the group-wide supervisor, the Commission is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor, provided that:\n\n1. The Commission's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth; and\n\n2. The regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the Commission's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the Commission is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.\n\nG. The Commission is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under § 38.2-1329, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.\n\nH. Each registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the necessary traveling and other expenses incurred by the Commission for its participation in the administration of this section. The Commission may retain at the registered insurer's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts reasonably necessary to assist in the administration of this section. Any persons so retained shall be under the direction and control of the Commission and shall act in a purely advisory capacity. The Commission may establish a regular assessment to the insurer for the payment of these expenses. If an assessment is required by this subsection, it shall be collected by the Commission and paid directly into the state treasury and credited to the \"Bureau of Insurance Special Fund — State Corporation Commission\" for the maintenance of the Bureau of Insurance as provided in subsection B of § 38.2-400.\n\n2019, c. 692.",

Notwithstanding any request from the Commission, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit any report required by this subsection if the Commission is the lead state of the insurance group as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\nB. The report shall include a signature of the insurer or insurance group's chief risk officer or other executive having responsibility for the oversight of the insurer's enterprise risk management process attesting to the best of his belief and knowledge that the insurer has applied the enterprise risk management process described in the ORSA summary report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.\n\nC. An insurer may comply with subsection A by providing the most recent and substantially similar report provided by the insurer or another member of an insurance group of which the insurer is a member to the commissioner of another state or to a supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction, if that report provides information that is comparable to the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual. Any such report in a language other than English must be accompanied by a translation of that report into the English language.\n\n2014, c. 248.",

An insurer shall be exempt from the requirements of this article if:\n\n1. The insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program, less than $500 million; and\n\n2. The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program, less than $1 billion.\n\nC. If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 1, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 2, then the ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to § 38.2-1334.6 shall include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers, provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.\n\nD. If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 1, but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 2, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to § 38.2-1334.6 shall be the report applicable to that insurer.\n\nE. An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection B may apply to the Commission for a waiver from the requirements of this article based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the Commission may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, and any other factor the Commission considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the Commission shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.\n\nF. Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section:\n\n1. The Commission may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA, and file an ORSA summary report based on unique circumstances, including the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests, and international supervisor requests.\n\n2. The Commission may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA, and file an ORSA summary report if the insurer has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in § 38.2-5503, meets one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in 14VAC5-290-30 of the Virginia Administrative Code, or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the Commission.\n\nG. If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subsection B subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this article.\n\n2014, c. 248.",

Notwithstanding any request from the Commission made pursuant to subsection C, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the Commissioner of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\nB. The CGAD shall include a signature of the insurer or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.\n\nC. An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the Commission's request.\n\nD. For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at one or more of the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level, or the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in level of reporting.\n\nE. The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state as determined by the procedures within the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook referenced in subsection A.\n\nF.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to prescribe or impose corporate governance standards and internal procedures beyond that which is required under applicable state corporate law.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, the provisions of subsections A, C, D and E of this section shall not apply if:\n\n1. The controlling producer (i) places insurance only with the controlled insurer, or only with the controlled insurer and a member or members of the controlled insurer's holding company system, or the controlled insurer's parent, affiliate or subsidiary and receives no compensation based upon the amount of premiums written in connection with such insurance and (ii) accepts insurance placements only from nonaffiliated subproducers and not directly from insureds; and\n\n2. The controlled insurer, except for insurance business written through a residual market facility such as the Virginia Automobile Insurance Plan, as set forth in § 38.2-2015, or the Virginia Property Insurance Association, as set forth in Chapter 27 (§ 38.2-2700 et seq.), accepts insurance business only from a controlling producer, a producer controlled by the controlled insurer, or a producer that is a subsidiary of the controlled insurer.\n\nC. A controlled insurer shall not accept business from a controlling producer and a controlling producer shall not place business with a controlled insurer unless there is a written contract between them specifying the responsibilities of each party, which contract has been approved by the board of directors of the insurer and contains the following minimum provisions:\n\n1. The controlled insurer may terminate the contract for cause, upon written notice to the controlling producer. The controlled insurer shall suspend the authority of the controlling producer to write business during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for the termination;\n\n2. The controlling producer shall render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges and other fees received by, or owing to, the controlling producer;\n\n3. The controlling producer shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the controlled insurer on at least a monthly basis. The due date shall be fixed so that premiums or installments thereof collected shall be remitted no later than ninety days after the effective date of any policy placed with the controlled insurer under this contract;\n\n4. All funds collected for the controlled insurer's account shall be held by the controlling producer in a fiduciary capacity, in one or more appropriately identified bank accounts in banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, in accordance with the provisions of the insurance law as applicable. However, funds of a controlling producer not required to be licensed in this Commonwealth shall be maintained in compliance with the requirements of the controlling producer's domiciliary jurisdiction;\n\n5. The controlling producer shall maintain separately identifiable records of business written for the controlled insurer;\n\n6. The contract shall not be assigned in whole or in part by the controlling producer;\n\n7. The controlled insurer shall provide the controlling producer with its underwriting standards, rules and procedures, manuals setting forth the rates to be charged, and the conditions for the acceptance or rejection of risks. The controlling producer shall adhere to the standards, rules, procedures, rates and conditions. The standards, rules, procedures, rates and conditions shall be the same as those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by a producer other than the controlling producer;\n\n8. The rates and terms of the controlling producer's commissions, charges or other fees and the purposes for those charges or fees shall be specified. The rates of the commissions, charges and other fees shall be no greater than those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by producers other than controlling producers. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 7 of this subsection, examples of \"comparable business\" include the same lines of insurance, same kinds of insurance, same kinds of risks, similar policy limits, and similar quality of business;\n\n9. If the contract provides that the controlling producer, on insurance business placed with the insurer, is to be compensated contingent upon the insurer's profits on that business, then such compensation shall not be determined and paid until at least five years after the premiums on liability insurance are earned and at least one year after the premiums are earned on any other insurance. In no event shall the commissions be paid until the adequacy of the controlled insurer's reserves on remaining claims has been independently verified pursuant to subdivision 1 of subsection E of this section;\n\n10. The contract shall place a limit on the controlling producer's writings in relation to the controlled insurer's surplus and total writings. The insurer may establish a different limit for each line or sub-line of business. The controlled insurer shall notify the controlling producer when the applicable limit is approached and shall not accept business from the controlling producer if the limit is reached. The controlling producer shall not place business with the controlled insurer if it has been notified by the controlled insurer that the limit has been reached; and\n\n11. The controlling producer may negotiate but shall not bind reinsurance on behalf of the controlled insurer on business the controlling producer places with the controlled insurer, except that the controlling producer may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the controlled insurer contains underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which such automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured and commission schedules.\n\nD. Every controlled insurer shall have an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors. The Audit Committee shall annually meet with management, the insurer's independent certified public accountants, and an independent casualty actuary or other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the Commission to review the adequacy of the insurer's loss reserves.\n\nE. The controlled insurer shall obtain annually prior to March 1 of each year the following data and reports:\n\n1. In addition to any other required loss reserve certification, an opinion of an independent casualty actuary reporting loss ratios for each line of business written and attesting to the adequacy of loss reserves established for losses incurred and outstanding as of year's end (including incurred but not reported) on business placed by the producer; and\n\n2. The controlled insurer shall annually report to the Commission the amount of commissions paid to the producer during the preceding calendar year, the percentage such amount represents of the net premiums written and comparable amounts and percentage paid to noncontrolling producers for placements of the same kinds of insurance.\n\nThe data and reports required by this subsection shall be retained by the insurer for a period of not less than five years and shall be filed with the Commission upon request.\n\n1993, c. 158.",

The legal minimum standard for the valuation of life insurance contracts issued prior to January 1, 1937, shall be on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at four percent per year, and strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of such contracts, and for life insurance contracts issued on and after that date shall be the one-year preliminary term method of valuation, as hereinafter modified, on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality or, at the option of the insurer, the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest at three and one-half percent per year.\n\n2. If the net renewal premium under a limited payment life preliminary term policy providing for the payment of less than 20 annual premiums under the policy, or under an endowment preliminary term policy, exceeds that under a 20-payment life preliminary term policy, the reserve for that policy at the end of any year, including the first, shall be at least the reserve on a 20-payment life preliminary term policy issued in the same year and at the same age, together with an amount equivalent to the accumulation of a net level premium sufficient to provide for a pure endowment maturing one year after the date on which the last annual premium is due, or at the end of 20 years if the policy provides for the payment of premiums for more than 20 years, equal to the difference between the value on the maturity date of a 20-payment life preliminary term policy and the full net level premium reserve at such time of such a limited payment life or endowment policy. Policies valued by the above method shall contain a clause specifying either that the reserve of the policies shall be computed in accordance with the 20-payment life modification of the preliminary term method of valuation or that the first year's insurance is term insurance.\n\n3. Except as otherwise provided in § 38.2-1370 for group annuity and pure endowment contracts, the legal minimum standard for the valuation of annuities issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be the Combined Annuity Table, with interest at four percent per year, but annuities deferred 10 or more years and written in connection with life insurance shall be valued on the same basis as that used in computing the consideration or premium for the life insurance, or upon any higher standard, at the insurer's option.\n\n4. The legal minimum standard for the calculation of the reserve liability for insurance against disability incorporated in life insurance policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be on the basis of any table adopted by the insurer and approved by the Commission, with interest at three and one-half percent per year. However, in no case shall such liability be less than one-half of the net annual premium for the disability benefit computed by the table.\n\n5. The legal standard for the valuation of group insurance written as yearly renewable term insurance issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be on the basis of the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest at three and one-half percent per year.\n\n6. The legal minimum standard for the valuation of industrial policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be the American Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at three and one-half percent per year; however, any insurer may voluntarily value its industrial policies on the basis of the standard industrial mortality table or the substandard industrial mortality table, and by the level net premium method or in accordance with their terms by the modified preliminary term method as described in subdivision 2, or the full preliminary term method.\n\nAll industrial policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be valued under the rules set forth in this section, whether or not the policies provide for surrender values, either in cash, paid-up insurance, or extended insurance.\n\n7. The Commission may vary the standards of interest and mortality in the case of alien insurers as to contracts issued by those insurers in countries other than the United States, and in particular cases of invalid lives and other extra hazards.\n\n8. If the actual annual premium charged for insurance is less than the net annual premium for the insurance, computed as specified in this section, the insurer shall set up an additional reserve equal to the value of an annuity of the difference between the actual premium charged and the net premium required by this section, and the term of which at the date of the valuation shall equal the period during which future premium payments are to become due on the insurance. The annuity shall be valued according to the table of mortality with the rate of interest at which the net annual premium is calculated.\n\n9. Reserves for all of these policies and contracts, or all of any class of these policies and contracts, may be calculated, at the insurer's option, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts, or all of the class of the policies and contracts so valued, than the minimum reserves required by this section; and in each case the insurer shall report to the Commission in its annual statement the standards it used in making the valuation.\n\n2014, c. 571.",

The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates determined as provided in subsection B:\n\n1. Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of § 38.2-3209;\n\n2. Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983, except that an insurer may elect for this to apply to all individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued after July 1, 1982;\n\n3.

The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.\n\nB. The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, referred to in this section as \"I,\" shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent:\n\n1. For life insurance:\n\nI =.03 + W(R1 -.03) + (W/2)(R2 -.09);\n\n2. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:\n\nI =.03 + W(R -.03).\n\nFor purposes of subdivisions 1 and 2:\n\nR1 is the lesser of R and.09;\n\nR2 is the greater of R and.09;\n\nR is the reference interest rate defined in this section; and\n\nW is the weighting factor defined in this section;\n\n3. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subdivision 2, the formula for life insurance stated in subdivision 1 shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years, and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision 2 shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less;\n\n4. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision 2 shall apply; and\n\n5. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision 2 shall apply.\n\nHowever, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when § 38.2-3209 becomes operative.\n\nC. The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated in subsection B are given in the following tables:\n\n1. Weighting factors for life insurance:\n\nFor life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, that are guaranteed in the original policy.\n\n2. Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:\n\n3. Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in subdivision 2, shall be as specified in tables a, b, and c of this subdivision, according to the rules and definitions in subdivisions d, e, and f of this subdivision:\n\na. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:\n\nb. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in table a increased by:\n\nc. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, other than those with no cash settlement options, that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in table a or derived in table b increased by:\n\nd. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guaranteed duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.\n\ne. \"Plan Type\" as used in tables a, b, and c is defined as follows:\n\nPlan Type A: At any time policyholder (i) may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, (ii) may withdraw funds without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more, (iii) may withdraw funds as an immediate life annuity, or (iv) is not permitted to withdraw funds.\n\nPlan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, (ii) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (iii) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without an adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years.\n\nPlan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either (i) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company or (ii) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.\n\nf. An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change-in-fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this section, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change-in-fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.\n\nD. The reference interest rate referred to in subsection B shall be defined as follows:\n\n1. For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n2. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n3. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year-of-issue basis, except as stated in subdivision 2, with guarantee duration in excess of 10 years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n4. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subdivision 2, with guarantee duration of 10 years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n5. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n6. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change-in-fund basis, except as stated in subdivision 2, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\nE. In the event that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the NAIC determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate adopted by the NAIC and approved by regulation adopted by the Commission may be substituted.\n\n2014, c. 571.",
