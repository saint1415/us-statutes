The nonforfeiture benefit referred to in § 38.2-3309 shall be available to the insured in the event of default in premium payments, after premiums have been paid for three full years. The premium paid for the insured under any policy provision shall not be considered in default. The nonforfeiture benefit shall be a stipulated form of insurance, effective from the due date of the defaulted premium, the net value of which shall at least equal the reserve at the date of default on the policy and on any dividend additions to the policy, exclusive of the reserve on account of return premium insurance and on total and permanent disability and additional accidental death benefits, less a sum not more than 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions to the policy and less any existing indebtedness to the insurer on or secured by the policy. The policy shall specify the mortality table and rate of interest used in computing these reserves. Instead of allowing a deduction from the reserve of a sum not more than 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy, and of any dividend additions to the policy, the insurer may insert in the policy a provision that one-fifth of the reserve may be deducted, or may provide in the policy that a deduction may be made of 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy or one-fifth of the reserve, at the insurer's option. The cash surrender value referred to in § 38.2-3309 shall be available upon surrender of the policy to the insurer within one month of the due date of the defaulted premium and shall at least equal the sum which would otherwise be available for the purchase of insurance. The insurer may defer payment for not more than three months after the application for the cash surrender value is made.\n\nC. If more than one option is provided, the policy shall stipulate which of the options shall be effective if the insured does not elect any option on or before the expiration of the grace period allowed for the payment of the premium.\n\nD. A provision may also be inserted in the policy that in the event of default in a premium payment before the options become available, the reserve on any dividend additions then in force may, at the insurer's option, be paid in cash or applied as a net premium to the purchase of paid-up term insurance for any amount not exceeding the face amount of the original policy.\n\nE. This section shall apply to term insurance policies only if the term is for more than twenty years.\n\nCode 1950, § 38-374; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-459; 1986, c. 562.",

The nonforfeiture benefits referred to in § 38.2-3347 shall be available in the event of default in premium payments after premiums have been paid for five full years, without action on the part of the insured. The nonforfeiture benefit shall be a stipulated form of insurance, effective from the due date of the defaulted premium, the net value of which at least equals the reserve on the policy, excluding any reserves for provisions (i) relating to benefits for specific types of disability, (ii) granting additional insurance specifically against accidental death, and (iii) granting other benefits in addition to life insurance, at the end of the last completed policy year for which premiums have been paid, and on any dividend additions to the policy, less a specified maximum percentage, not more than 2 1/2 percent, of the maximum face amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions to the policy and less any existing indebtedness to the insurer on or secured by the policy. The policy shall specify the mortality table, rate of interest and method of valuation used for computing these reserves. The policy shall also specify the percentage or other rule of calculation so as to permit determination of the values for each year for which required values are not included in the policy. Instead of allowing for the deduction from the reserve of a sum not more than 2 1/2 percent of the maximum face amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions to the policy, the insurer may insert in the policy a provision that one-fifth of the reserve may be deducted, or may provide in the policy that a deduction may be made of 2 1/2 percent of the maximum face amount insured by the policy or one-fifth of the reserve at the insurer's option.\n\nC. If more than one option is provided, the policy shall stipulate which of the options shall apply if the insured fails to notify the insurer of his selection of an option.\n\nD. The cash surrender value referred to in § 38.2-3347 shall be available after premiums have been paid for ten full years upon surrender of the policy to the insurer within three months of the due date of the defaulted premium and shall be at least equal to the sum which would otherwise be available for the purchase of insurance. The insurer may defer payment for not more than three months after the application for the cash surrender value is made.

On and after the operative date stated in § 38.2-3214, no life insurance policy, except as stated in § 38.2-3213, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth unless it contains in substance the following provisions and statements, or corresponding provisions and statements that in the opinion of the Commission (i) are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder and (ii) essentially comply with § 38.2-3212:\n\n1. That in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of the due date, in the amount specified in this article. Instead of the stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit that provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.\n\n2. That upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default, after premiums have been paid for at least three full years for ordinary insurance or five full years for industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, instead of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value in the amount specified in this chapter.\n\n3. That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make an election selects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.\n\n4. That for a policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit that became effective on or after the third policy anniversary for ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary for industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value in the amount specified in this article.\n\n5. For policies that provide on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or both, or that provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums, or both, other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. All other policies shall include a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter. The values and benefits referred to in this subdivision shall be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.\n\n6. A brief and general statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy, with an explanation of how the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy affects the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\nB. To the extent that any of the foregoing provisions are not applicable to the plan of insurance, they may be omitted from the policy with the approval of the Commission.\n\nC.

The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\nB. The equivalent uniform amount of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy is the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy. However, for a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by the policy at age ten.\n\nC. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by a rider or a supplemental policy provision shall equal (i) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable by (ii) the adjusted premiums for the term insurance.

For a policy that provides, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or both, or that provides an option for changes in benefits or premiums, or both, other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any change in the benefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\nD.

Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by § 38.2-3202, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and any paid-up dividend additions;\n\n3. An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up additions, under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;\n\n4. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with any accompanying pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;\n\n5. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables referred to in this section;\n\n6. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners Standard ordinary mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and approved by the Commission for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. \"Operative date of the valuation manual\" means the January 1 of the first calendar year that the valuation manual as defined in § 38.2-1365 is effective.\n\nFor policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners Standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commission approves by regulation any Commissioners Standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and\n\n7. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners Standard industrial mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by the Commission for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\nFor policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners Standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commission approves by regulation any Commissioners Standard industrial mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\nI. The nonforfeiture annual interest rate for any policy issued in a particular calendar year:\n\n1. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, shall equal 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy as defined in Article 10 (§ 38.2-1365 et seq.) of Chapter 13, rounded to the nearest one-quarter percent, provided, however, that the nonforfeiture annual interest rate shall not be less than four percent; and\n\n2. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, shall be provided by the valuation manual.\n\nJ. Any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form that involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.\n\nK. After July 1, 1982, any insurer may file with the Commission a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this section for that insurer. If an insurer makes no election, the operative date of this section for that insurer shall be January 1, 1989.\n\n1982, c. 228, § 38.1-465.3; 1986, c. 562; 2014, c. 571.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for any contract issued on or after April 1, 2003, and before July 1, 2005, the interest rate at which net considerations, partial withdrawals, and partial surrenders may be accumulated, for the purposes of determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts, may be one and one-half percent per year.\n\nF. The following provisions shall apply for contracts issued on or after July 1, 2005, and at the election of the insurer may apply also to specified contracts issued on or after July 1, 2004. An insurer may make this election on a contract-form-by-contract-form basis by filing written notice with the Commission and specifying a date for the provisions to apply prior to July 1, 2005.\n\n1. The minimum nonforfeiture amount at or any time before the beginning of any annuity payments shall equal an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest, as indicated in subdivision 3, of the net considerations as defined in this subsection, paid prior to that time, and decreased by the sum of:\n\na. Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3;\n\nb. An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3;\n\nc. Any premium tax paid by the insurer for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3, adjusted for any tax that is not actually paid or which has been credited back to the insurer, such as upon early termination of the contract; and\n\nd. The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued.\n\n2. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to 87.5 percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.\n\n3. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:\n\na. The five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than 15 months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under this subdivision;\n\nb. Reduced by 125 basis points;\n\nc. Where the resulting interest rate is not less than 15 basis points (0.15 percent); and\n\nd. The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date.\n\n4. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subdivision 3 b by up to an additional 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The Commission may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Where administration is lacking or unacceptable, the Commission may, at its discretion, disallow or limit the additional reduction.\n\nG. The Commission may adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of subdivision F 4 and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts for which the Commission determines adjustments are justified.\n\n1979, c. 437, § 38.1-470.1; 1986, c. 562; 2003, c. 440; 2004, c. 313; 2022, c. 176.",
