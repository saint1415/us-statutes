Who is a licensed, board certified, or board eligible physician qualified to practice in the area of medicine appropriate to treat the covered person's condition, has certified in writing that scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols demonstrate that the health care service or treatment requested is likely to be more beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care services or treatments;\n\n5. The covered person has exhausted or is deemed to have exhausted the health carrier's internal appeal process; and\n\n6. The covered person has provided all the required information and forms that are necessary to process an external review.\n\nE. Within one business day after completion of the preliminary review, the health carrier shall notify in writing the Commission and the covered person and his authorized representative, if any, whether the request is complete and eligible for external review. The following shall apply with regard to such requests:\n\n1. If the request is not complete, the health carrier shall inform in writing the Commission, the covered person, and his authorized representative, if any, and include in the notice what information or materials are needed to make the request complete. If the request is not eligible for external review, the health carrier shall inform the covered person, his authorized representative, if any, and the Commission in writing and include in the notice the reasons for its ineligibility. Such notice shall include a statement informing the covered person and his authorized representative, if any, that the health carrier's determination of ineligibility may be appealed to the Commission; and\n\n2.

Within five business days after the date of receipt of the notice from the Commission, the health carrier or its designee utilization review entity shall provide to the assigned independent review organization the documents and any information considered in making the adverse determination or the final adverse determination. Failure by the health carrier or its designee utilization review entity to provide the documents and information within the required time specified shall not delay the conduct of the external review. If the health carrier or its designee utilization review entity has failed to provide the documents and information within the required time specified, the assigned independent review entity may terminate the external review and make a decision to reverse the adverse determination or final adverse determination. Promptly upon making such decision, the independent review organization shall notify the covered person, his authorized representative, if any, the health carrier, and the Commission.\n\nH. Each clinical reviewer selected shall review all of the information and documents timely received from the health carrier and any other information submitted in writing by the covered person or his authorized representative. The assigned independent review organization is not required to, but may, accept and consider information submitted late from the covered person or his authorized representative, if any. Upon receipt of any information submitted by the covered person or his authorized representative, within one business day after the receipt of the information, the assigned independent review organization shall forward the information to the health carrier.\n\nI. Upon receipt of the information from the assigned independent review organization, the health carrier may reconsider its adverse determination or final adverse determination. Reconsideration by the health carrier of its adverse determination or final adverse determination shall not delay or terminate the external review. The external review may be terminated only if the health carrier decides to reverse its adverse determination or final adverse determination and provide coverage or payment for the recommended or requested health care service or treatment.

Consulting reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the health carrier, covered person, his authorized representative, or the covered person's treating physician or health care professional;\n\n4. Whether the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is a covered service except for the health carrier's determination that the service or treatment is experimental or investigational; and\n\n5. Whether the recommended or requested health care service or treatment has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, if applicable, for the condition, or medical or scientific evidence or evidence-based standards demonstrate that the expected benefits of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care service or treatment and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments.\n\nK. Within 20 days after being selected to conduct a standard external review, each clinical reviewer shall provide an opinion to the assigned independent review organization on whether the recommended or requested health care service or treatment should be covered. Each clinical reviewer's opinion shall be in writing and include the following information: a description of the covered person's medical condition; a description of the indicators relevant to determining whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be more beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care services or treatments and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments; a description and analysis of any medical or scientific evidence considered in reaching the opinion; a description and analysis of any evidence-based standard; and information on the extent, if any, to which the reviewer's rationale for the opinion regarding the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is based on (i) whether the health care service or treatment has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for the condition or (ii) medical or scientific evidence or evidence-based standards that demonstrate the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be more beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care service or treatment and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments.\n\nL.

The additional clinical reviewer selected shall use the same information as the original clinical reviewers. The selection of the additional clinical reviewer shall not extend the time within which the assigned independent review organization is required to make a decision.\n\nM. The independent review organization shall include in the notice required pursuant to subsection L a general description of the reason for the request for external review; the written opinion of each clinical reviewer, including the recommendation of each clinical reviewer as to whether the recommended or requested health care service or treatment should be covered and the rationale for the reviewer's recommendation; the date the independent review organization was assigned by the Commission to conduct the external review; the date the external review was conducted; the date of its decision; the principal reason or reasons for its decision; and the rationale for its decision.\n\nN.
