When a filing is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports the filing, and the Commission does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the requirements of this chapter, the Commission may require the insurer to furnish the information upon which it supports the filing. A filing and any supporting information shall be a public record. Upon filing any rate to which this chapter is applicable, the insurer shall give notice to the Division of Consumer Counsel of the Office of the Attorney General that such rate has been filed with the Commission and such insurer shall so certify to the Commission in its rate filing.

In making rates for the classes of insurance to which this chapter applies, separate consideration shall be given to (i) past and prospective loss experience within and outside this Commonwealth, (ii) conflagration or catastrophe hazards, (iii) a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, (iv) dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, (v) past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this Commonwealth, (vi) investment income earned or realized by insurers from their unearned premium and loss reserve and the Commission may give separate consideration to investment income earned on surplus funds, (vii) the loss reserving practices, standards and procedures utilized by the insurer, and (viii) all other relevant factors within and outside this Commonwealth.

For the classes of insurance to which this chapter applies (i) the systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group for any class of insurance, or for any subdivision or combination of insurance for which separate expense provisions apply, and (ii) risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that establish standards for measuring variations in hazards, expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\n\nD.
