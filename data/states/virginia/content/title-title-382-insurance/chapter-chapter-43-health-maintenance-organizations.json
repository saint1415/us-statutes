      "text": "As used in this chapter:\n\n\"Acceptable securities\" means securities that (i) are legal investments under the laws of the Commonwealth for public sinking funds or for other public funds, (ii) are not in default as to principal or interest, (iii) have a current market value of not less than $50,000 nor more than $500,000, and (iv) are issued pursuant to a system of book-entry evidencing ownership interests of the securities with transfers of ownership effected on the records of the depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by the depository.\n\n\"Basic health care services\" means in and out-of-area emergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services, laboratory and radiologic services, mental health and substance use disorder benefits, and preventive health services. In the case of a health maintenance organization that has contracted with the Commonwealth to furnish basic health services to recipients of medical assistance under Title XIX of the United States Social Security Act pursuant to § 38.2-4320, the basic health services to be provided by the health maintenance organization to program recipients may differ from the basic health services required by this section to the extent necessary to meet the benefit standards prescribed by the state plan for medical assistance services authorized pursuant to § 32.1-325.\n\n\"Copayment\" means an amount an enrollee is required to pay in order to receive a specific health care service.\n\n\"Deductible\" means an amount an enrollee is required to pay out-of-pocket before the health care plan begins to pay the costs associated with health care services.\n\n\"Emergency services\" means those health care services that are rendered by affiliated or nonaffiliated providers after the sudden onset of a medical condition that manifests itself by symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine to result in (i) serious jeopardy to the mental or physical health of the individual, (ii) danger of serious impairment of the individual's bodily functions, (iii) serious dysfunction of any of the individual's bodily organs, or (iv) in the case of a pregnant woman, serious jeopardy to the health of the fetus. Emergency services provided within the plan's service area shall include covered health care services from nonaffiliated providers only when delay in receiving care from a provider affiliated with the health maintenance organization could reasonably be expected to cause the enrollee's condition to worsen if left unattended.\n\n\"Enrollee\" or \"member\" means an individual who is enrolled in a health care plan.\n\n\"Evidence of coverage\" means any certificate or individual or group agreement or contract issued in conjunction with the certificate, agreement or contract, issued to a subscriber setting out the coverage and other rights to which an enrollee is entitled.\n\n\"Excess insurance\" or \"stop loss insurance\" means insurance issued to a health maintenance organization by an insurer licensed in the Commonwealth, on a form approved by the Commission, or a risk assumption transaction acceptable to the Commission, providing indemnity or reimbursement against the cost of health care services provided by the health maintenance organization.\n\n\"Health care plan\" means any arrangement in which any person undertakes to provide, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse any part of the cost of any health care services. A significant part of the arrangement shall consist of arranging for or providing health care services, including emergency services and services rendered by nonparticipating referral providers, as distinguished from mere indemnification against the cost of the services, on a prepaid basis. For purposes of this section, a significant part shall mean at least 90 percent of total costs of health care services.\n\n\"Health care services\" means the furnishing of services to any individual for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing, or healing human illness, injury, or physical disability.\n\n\"Health maintenance organization\" means any person who undertakes to provide or arrange for one or more health care plans.\n\n\"Limited health care services\" means dental care services, vision care services, and such other services as may be determined by the Commission to be limited health care services. Limited health care services shall not include hospital, medical, surgical, or emergency services except as such services are provided incident to the limited health care services set forth in the preceding sentence.\n\n\"Net worth\" or \"capital and surplus\" means the excess of total admitted assets over the total liabilities of the health maintenance organization, provided that surplus notes shall be reported and accounted for in accordance with guidance set forth in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) accounting practice and procedures manuals.\n\n\"Nonparticipating referral provider\" means a provider who is not a participating provider but with whom a health maintenance organization has arranged, through referral by its participating providers, to provide health care services to enrollees. Payment or reimbursement by a health maintenance organization for health care services provided by nonparticipating referral providers may exceed five percent of total costs of health care services, only to the extent that any such excess payment or reimbursement over five percent shall be combined with the costs for services which represent mere indemnification, with the combined amount subject to the combination of limitations set forth in this definition and in this section's definition of health care plan.\n\n\"Participating provider\" means a provider who has agreed to provide health care services to enrollees and to hold those enrollees harmless from payment with an expectation of receiving payment, other than copayments or deductibles, directly or indirectly from the health maintenance organization.\n\n\"Provider\" or \"health care provider\" means any physician, hospital, or other person that is licensed or otherwise authorized in the Commonwealth to furnish health care services.\n\n\"Subscriber\" means a contract holder, an individual enrollee, or the enrollee in an enrolled family who is responsible for payment to the health maintenance organization or on whose behalf such payment is made.\n\n1980, c. 720, § 38.1-863; 1986, cc. 76, 528, 562; 1990, c. 224; 1992, cc. 241, 481; 1993, c. 305; 1995, cc. 182, 345; 2000, c. 503; 2003, cc. 752, 767; 2004, c. 175; 2006, c. 448; 2015, c. 649.",

      "text": "A. The Commission shall issue a license to a health maintenance organization after the receipt of a complete application and payment of a $500 nonrefundable application fee if the Commission is satisfied that the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The persons responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the applicant are competent, trustworthy, and reputable;\n\n2. The health care plan constitutes an appropriate mechanism for the health maintenance organization to provide or arrange for the provision of, as a minimum, basic health care services or limited health care services on a prepaid basis, except to the extent of reasonable requirements for copayments, deductibles, or both;\n\n3. The health maintenance organization is financially responsible and may reasonably be expected to meet its obligations to enrollees and prospective enrollees. In making this determination, the Commission may consider:\n\na. The financial soundness of the health care plan's arrangements for health care services and the schedule of prepaid charges used for those services;\n\nb. The adequacy of working capital;\n\nc. Any agreement with an insurer, a health services plan, a government, or any other organization for insuring the payment of the cost of health care services or the provision for automatic applicability of an alternative coverage if the health care plan is discontinued;\n\nd. Any contracts with health care providers that set forth the health care services to be performed and the providers' responsibilities for fulfilling the health maintenance organization's obligations to its enrollees;\n\ne. The deposit of acceptable securities in an amount satisfactory to the Commission, submitted in accordance with § 38.2-4310 as a guarantee that the obligations to the enrollees will be duly performed;\n\nf.

Nothing in the method of operation is contrary to the public interest, as shown in the information submitted pursuant to § 38.2-4301 or Chapter 58 (§ 38.2-5800 et seq.) or by independent investigation. Issuance of a license shall not constitute approval of the forms submitted under subdivisions B 6, 7, and 12 of § 38.2-4301.\n\nB. A licensed health maintenance organization shall have and maintain at all times the minimum net worth described in subdivision A 3 f.\n\n1. If the Commission finds that the minimum net worth of a domestic health maintenance organization is impaired, the Commission shall issue an order requiring the health maintenance organization to eliminate the impairment within a period not exceeding 90 days. The Commission may by order served upon the health maintenance organization prohibit the health maintenance organization from issuing any new contracts while the impairment exists. If at the expiration of the designated period the health maintenance organization has not satisfied the Commission that the impairment has been eliminated, an order for the rehabilitation or liquidation of the health maintenance organization may be entered.\n\n2. If the Commission finds an impairment of the minimum net worth of any foreign health maintenance organization, the Commission may order the health maintenance organization to eliminate the impairment and restore the minimum net worth to the amount required by this section. The Commission may, by order served upon the health maintenance organization, prohibit the health maintenance organization from issuing any new contracts while the impairment exists. If the health maintenance organization fails to comply with the Commission's order within a period of not more than 90 days, the Commission may, in the manner set out in § 38.2-4316, suspend or revoke the license of the health maintenance organization.\n\n3. Prior to December 31, 1999, a health maintenance organization with less than minimum net worth which is licensed on and after June 30, 1998, may continue to operate as a licensed health maintenance organization without a finding of impairment if the licensee has net worth (i) on June 30, 1998, and up to December 31, 1998, in an amount at least equal to the sum of uncovered expenses, but not less than $300,000, up to a maximum of $2 million; (ii) on December 31, 1998, and up to June 30, 1999, in an amount at least equal to the sum of uncovered expenses, but not less than $400,000, up to a maximum of $2.5 million; and (iii) on June 30, 1999, and up to December 31, 1999, in an amount at least equal to the sum of uncovered expenses, but not less than $500,000, up to a maximum of $3 million.\n\n1980, c. 720, § 38.1-865; 1981, c. 317; 1986, c. 562; 1992, c. 481; 1998, cc. 42, 891; 2000, c. 503; 2003, cc. 752, 767; 2004, c. 175; 2018, c. 706.",

Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, no health maintenance organization providing health care plans, or its pharmacy benefits manager, as defined in § 38.2-3465, shall prohibit any person receiving pharmaceutical benefits, including specialty pharmacy benefits, thereunder from selecting, without limitation, the pharmacy of his choice to furnish such benefits. This right of selection extends to and includes any pharmacy that is not a participating provider under any such health care plan and that has previously notified the health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager on its own behalf or through an intermediary, by facsimile or otherwise, of its agreement to accept reimbursement for its services at rates applicable to pharmacies that are participating providers, including any copayment consistently imposed by the plan, as payment in full. Each health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager shall permit prompt electronic or telephonic transmittal of the reimbursement agreement by the pharmacy and ensure prompt verification to the pharmacy of the terms of reimbursement. In no event shall any person receiving a covered pharmacy benefit from a nonparticipating provider that has submitted a reimbursement agreement be responsible for amounts that may be charged by the nonparticipating provider in excess of the copayment and the health maintenance organization's reimbursement applicable to all of its participating pharmacy providers. If a pharmacy has provided notice pursuant to this subsection through an intermediary, the health maintenance organization or its intermediary may elect to respond directly to the pharmacy instead of the intermediary. Nothing in this subsection shall (i) require a health maintenance organization or its intermediary to contract with or to disclose confidential information to a pharmacy's intermediary or (ii) prohibit a health maintenance organization or its intermediary from contracting with or disclosing confidential information to a pharmacy's intermediary.\n\nB. No such health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager shall impose upon any person receiving pharmaceutical benefits furnished under any such health care plan:\n\n1. Any copayment, fee or condition that is not equally imposed upon all individuals in the same benefit category, class or copayment level, whether or not such benefits are furnished by pharmacists who are not participating providers;\n\n2. Any monetary penalty that would affect or influence any such person's choice of pharmacy; or\n\n3. Any reduction in allowable reimbursement for pharmacy services related to utilization of pharmacists who are not participating providers.\n\nC. For purposes of this section, a prohibited condition or penalty shall include, without limitation: (i) denying immediate access to electronic claims filing to a pharmacy that is a nonparticipating provider and that has complied with subsection E or (ii) requiring a person receiving pharmacy benefits to make payment at point of service, except to the extent such conditions and penalties are similarly imposed on participating providers.\n\nD. The provisions of this section are not applicable to any pharmaceutical benefit covered by a health care plan when those benefits are obtained from a pharmacy wholly owned and operated by, or exclusively operated for, the health maintenance organization providing the health care plan.\n\nE. Any pharmacy that wishes to be covered by this section shall, if requested to do so in writing by a health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager, within 30 days of the pharmacy's receipt of the request, execute and deliver to the health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager, the direct service agreement or participating provider agreement that the health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager requires all of its participating providers of pharmacy benefits to execute. Any pharmacy that fails to timely execute and deliver such agreement shall not be covered by this section with respect to that health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager unless and until the pharmacy executes and delivers the agreement. No pharmacy shall be precluded from obtaining a direct service agreement or participating provider agreement for retail and specialty pharmacy if the pharmacy meets the terms and conditions of participation. Any request by a pharmacy for a direct service agreement or a participating provider agreement shall be acted upon by a health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager within 60 days of receipt of the pharmacy's request or any subsequent submission of supplemental information if requested by the health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager.\n\nF. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies arising out of this section.\n\nG. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of a health maintenance organization providing health care plans to select a single mail order pharmacy provider as the exclusive provider of pharmacy services that are delivered to the covered person's address by mail, common carrier, or delivery service. The provisions of this section shall not apply to such contracts.
