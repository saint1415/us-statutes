The Commission shall not approve the change of status unless it is satisfied that the financial condition of the nonstock corporation and the proposed method of operation and manner of doing business enable the nonstock corporation to meet its contractual obligations to all subscribers and that the nonstock corporation has otherwise complied with the requirements of this chapter. The Commission shall (i) consider, among other things, the sufficiency of the contingency reserve required under subsection E and (ii) subject the nonstock corporation, notwithstanding the provisions of § 38.2-1700, to the requirements of Chapter 17 (§ 38.2-1700 et seq.).
