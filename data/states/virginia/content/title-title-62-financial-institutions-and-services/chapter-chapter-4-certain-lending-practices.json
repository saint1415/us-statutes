Any lender or seller may impose a late charge for failure to make timely payment of any installment due on a debt, whether installment or single maturity, provided that such late charge does not exceed five percent of the amount of such installment payment and that the charge is specified in the contract between the lender or seller and the debtor.\n\nC. If any federal governmental agency or organization shall adopt any rules or regulations dealing with the application of late penalties as to loans insured or guaranteed by such federal agency or organization, then such rules and regulations shall control as to such loans insured or guaranteed by them.\n\nD.

Upon such acceleration, the holder of the contract of indebtedness shall not be entitled to judgment for unearned interest, but the balance owing shall be computed as follows:\n\n1. On loans payable in equal periodic installments with an initial maturity and corresponding amortization period not exceeding 61 months, the accelerated balance shall be calculated as if the borrower had made a voluntary prepayment and obtained as of the date of acceleration an interest credit based upon the Rule of 78 rebate method as defined in § 6.2-403; and\n\n2.

Determine the denominator of the fraction, to be used as provided in subdivision 3, by adding the integers corresponding to the number of months over which the loan is to be repaid according to its terms, which in the example of a four-year loan would be the sum obtained by adding all of the integers in the series one through 48.\n\n2. Determine the numerator of the fraction, to be used as provided in subdivision 3, by adding in inverse sequence the integers corresponding to the number of months remaining on the loan after payment is anticipated, which in the example of a four-year loan anticipated after the third month, would be the sum obtained by adding all of the integers in the series 45 through one.\n\n3. Multiply the original amount of interest that would have been paid over the life of the loan by a fraction that has as its denominator the number determined as in subdivision 1 and as its numerator the number determined as in subdivision 2. The product is the amount of unearned interest to be rebated under the Rule of 78.\n\nC.
