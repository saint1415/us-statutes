The person notifies the Commission of the acquisition in cooperation with the licensee and attests to subdivisions 1 through 4 in a form and in a medium prescribed by the Commission.\n\nIf such notice is not disapproved within 30 days after the date on which the notice was determined to be complete, the notice shall be deemed approved.\n\nN. Before filing an application for approval to acquire control of a licensee, a person may request in writing a determination from the Commission as to whether the person would be considered a person in control of a licensee upon consummation of a proposed transaction. If the Commission determines that the person would not be a person in control of a licensee, the person and transaction is not subject to the requirements of subsections A and B.\n\nO. If a multistate licensing process includes a determination pursuant to subsection N or the equivalent law of another state and a person invokes or is otherwise subject to the multistate licensing process, (i) the Commission may accept the control determination of a lead investigative state if the Commission finds that the lead investigative state has sufficient staffing, expertise, and minimum standards or (ii) if the Commonwealth is a lead investigative state, the Commission may investigate the person using the timeframes established by agreement through the multistate licensing process.\n\nP. If any person acquires an ownership interest in a licensee without obtaining prior approval from the Commission as required by this section, the Commission may for good cause shown order such person to divest himself or itself of such ownership interest.\n\nQ. The Commission shall not enter an order requiring divestiture pursuant to subsection P until it has given the person 21 days' notice in writing of the reasons for the proposed divestiture and has given the person an opportunity to introduce evidence and be heard. The notice shall be sent by certified mail to such person and shall state with particularity the grounds for the contemplated action. Within 14 days of mailing the notice, the person named therein may file with the clerk of the Commission a written request for a hearing.
