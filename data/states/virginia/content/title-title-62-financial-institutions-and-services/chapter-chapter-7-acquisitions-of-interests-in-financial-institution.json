Extended only if the Commission determines that the applicant has not furnished all the information required by subsection A of § 6.2-704 or that the information submitted is substantially inaccurate or misleading.\n\nC. Within the prescribed investigation period, and upon request of the applicant or the Virginia financial institution or Virginia financial institution holding company that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired, the Commission may order a hearing concerning the proposed acquisition.\n\nD.
