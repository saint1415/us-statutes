The following provisions shall apply to the database:\n\n1. Before making a short-term loan, a licensee shall query the database through a Commission-certified database provider and shall retain evidence of the query for the Commission's supervisory review. The database shall allow a licensee to make a short-term loan only if making the loan is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. During any period that the database is unavailable due to technical problems beyond the licensee's control, a licensee may rely on the loan applicant's written representations, rather than the database's information, to verify that making the loan applied for is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. Because a licensee may rely on the accuracy of the applicant's representations and the database's information, a licensee is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability if that information is later determined to be inaccurate.\n\n2. The database provider shall maintain the database, take all actions it deems necessary to protect the confidentiality and security of the information contained in the database, be responsible for the confidentiality and security of such information, and own the information contained in the database. The Commission shall have access to and utilize the database as a supervision and enforcement tool to ensure licensees' compliance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n3. Upon a licensee's query, the database shall advise the licensee whether the applicant is eligible for a new short-term loan and, if the applicant is ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility. If the database advises the licensee that the applicant is ineligible for a short-term loan, then the applicant shall direct any inquiry regarding the specific reason for such ineligibility to the database provider rather than to the licensee. The information contained in the database is confidential and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.).\n\n4. If a licensee and borrower consummate a loan, then the licensee shall pay a fee to defray the costs of submitting the database inquiry. The amount of the database inquiry fee shall be calculated in accordance with a schedule set by the Commission. The schedule shall bear a reasonable relationship to actual cost of the operation of the database. If a licensee submits a database inquiry but does not consummate a loan with the applicant, then the licensee shall not pay the database inquiry fee. Each licensee shall remit all database inquiry fees directly to the database provider on a weekly basis.\n\n5. If a borrower enters into a short-term loan or pays or otherwise satisfies a short-term loan in full, then the licensee making the loan shall report such event or other information to the database not later than the close of business on the date of such event.\n\n2008, cc. 849, 876, § 6.1-453.1; 2010, c. 794; 2020, cc. 1215, 1258.",

Prior to making a loan, a licensee shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the borrower's eligibility under this subsection that includes reviewing the files of any affiliate that is licensed under Chapter 22.

A licensee shall not cause a borrower to be obligated upon more than one loan at any time.\n\n8. A check accepted by a licensee as security for any loan shall be dated no earlier than the date of the first required loan payment shown in the loan agreement.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any provision of § 8.01-226.10 to the contrary, a licensee shall not threaten, or cause to be instigated, criminal proceedings against a borrower if a check given as security for a loan is dishonored or for any reason related to the borrower's failure to pay any sum due under a loan agreement.\n\n10. A licensee shall not (i) accept the title or registration of a vehicle, real or personal property, or any interest in any property other than a check payable to the licensee as security for a loan; (ii) create or accept any remotely created check, as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 229.2(fff), in connection with a loan; (iii) draft funds electronically from a borrower's account without express written authorization from the borrower; or (iv) fail to stop attempts to draft funds electronically from a borrower's account upon request from the borrower or his agent.

Loan proceeds shall be disbursed in cash or by the licensee's business check. No fee shall be charged by the licensee or an affiliate for cashing a loan proceeds check.\n\n15.

The loan documents shall include verification that the borrower is not a member of the military services of the United States or the spouse or other dependent of a member of the military services of the United States.\n\n20.

A short-term loan agreement shall not be sold or otherwise assigned to any other person who is not also a licensee, and if a loan agreement or its servicing is sold or assigned to another licensee, the buyer or assignee of the loan agreement shall be subject to the same obligations under this chapter that apply to the selling or assigning licensee. If a licensee sells or assigns a short-term loan or its servicing, the licensee shall provide to the borrower written notice and the information needed to make future payments no later than 10 days before the borrower's next payment due date.\n\n23. A licensee shall not make a loan to a borrower that includes an acceleration clause or demand feature that permits the licensee, in the event the borrower fails to meet the repayment terms for any outstanding balance, to terminate the loan in advance of the original maturity date and to demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance, unless both of the following conditions are met: (i) not earlier than 10 days after the borrower's payment was due, the licensee provides written notice to the borrower of the termination of the loan and (ii) in addition to the outstanding balance, the licensee collects only prorated interest and the fees earned up to termination of the loan. For purposes of this subdivision, the outstanding balance and prorated interest and fees shall be calculated as if the borrower had voluntarily prepaid the loan in full on the date of termination.\n\n24. A licensee may not file or initiate a legal proceeding of any kind against a borrower until 60 days after the date of default on a short-term loan, during which period the licensee and borrower may voluntarily enter into a repayment arrangement.\n\n25. A licensee shall not recommend to a borrower that the borrower obtain a loan for a dollar amount that is higher than the borrower has requested.\n\n26. A licensee may not engage in any unfair, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent acts or practices in the conduct of its business.\n\n27.
