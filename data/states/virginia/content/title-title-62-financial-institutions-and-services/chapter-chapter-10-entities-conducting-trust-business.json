When shares of a national banking association or of a banking corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or another state are held by a trust institution that is serving as a personal representative of a decedent, trustee, guardian of any infant, agent or in any other fiduciary capacity, the trust institution may not (i) vote or participate in the voting of any voting securities of such bank if the securities held in such fiduciary capacity, together with all the other voting securities of such bank held in a fiduciary capacity, exceed 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such bank or (ii) vote such voting securities, if the voting securities of such bank held as a personal representative of the decedent, together with all other voting securities of such bank held in a fiduciary capacity, exceed five percent, unless there has been a determination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that the right to vote five percent or more of the voting securities but less than 25 percent thereof does not constitute control of that bank.\n\nC. If there is any personal representative, trustee, guardian of any infant, or other fiduciary in addition to the trust institution in such fiduciary capacity, the other fiduciary, if not a director, officer, or employee of the trust institution, may vote such shares. If the trust institution is the sole fiduciary, or if the trust institution is serving along with a director, officer, or employee of the trust institution, it may petition the court, as provided in subsection D, for the appointment of a cofiduciary for the sole purpose of voting such bank shares.\n\nD. When a trust institution has qualified or is serving under the laws of the Commonwealth as personal representative of a decedent, trustee, guardian of any infant, or in any other fiduciary capacity, and in such estate or trust, there are shares of stock of a national banking association or a banking corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or another state, and the trust institution is disqualified under subsection B from voting such shares, the trust institution or any interested party may petition the court in which the institution qualified or is capable to qualify to appoint a cofiduciary for the sole purpose of voting the shares of the banking association or banking corporation held by the estate or trust, which the trust institution is disqualified from voting. The appointment and qualification may be ex parte, and no prior notice to the beneficiary shall be required. The court at the time of such qualification may relieve the cofiduciary of any obligation for the giving of surety on his bond, and if the appointment of the cofiduciary is limited to voting of the bank stock, such order may provide that the cofiduciary shall not be liable or accountable as a fiduciary in the administration of such estate or trust except for the breach of any fiduciary duty in voting or failing to vote such bank stock. No director, officer, or employee of a trust institution shall be eligible to be named cofiduciary under the provisions of this subsection.\n\n1972, c. 203, §§ 6.1-31.1, 6.1-31.2; 1974, c. 665; 2010, c. 794.",

      "text": "A. If, in the opinion of the Commission, an association is unlawfully or unsoundly exercising, or has unlawfully or unsoundly exercised, or has failed for a period of five consecutive years to exercise, the powers granted by this chapter, or otherwise fails or has failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the Commission may issue and serve upon the association a notice of intent to revoke the authority of the association to exercise the powers granted by this chapter. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unlawful or unsound exercise of powers, or failure to exercise powers, or failure to comply, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held before the Commission to determine whether an order revoking authority to exercise such powers should issue against the association.\n\nB. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Rules, and shall be fixed for a date not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days after the service of such notice, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Commission at the request of the association so served.\n\nC. Unless the association so served shall appear by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the revocation order. In the event of such consent or if, upon the record made at any such hearing, the Commission shall find that any allegation specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Commission shall issue and serve upon the association an order prohibiting it from accepting any new or additional trust accounts and revoking authority to exercise any and all powers granted by this chapter, except that such order shall permit the association to continue to service all previously accepted trust accounts pending their expeditious divestiture or termination.\n\nD. A revocation order shall become effective not later than the expiration of 30 days after service of such order upon the association and shall remain effective and enforceable, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Commission or a reviewing court. In the case of a revocation order issued upon the consent of an association, such order shall become effective at the time specified therein.\n\n1984, c. 303, § 6.1-195.95; 2010, c. 794.",
