The rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State, provided however that where the rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State's scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.\n\nC. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder.

The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.\n\n2.

The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\nN. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.\n\nArticle 11.

The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nB. Default, technical assistance, and termination.\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\nD. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's state licensing authority and each of the Member States' state licensing authority.\n\nE. a state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\nF.

The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\nI. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member and non-Member States.\n\n2.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.\n\n3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules.

A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Article 11.\n\nb. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than seven (7).\n\n2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in subdivision C 23 of Article 8 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.\n\n3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.\n\n4. Any state that joins the Compact shall be subject to the Commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.\n\nB. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing that state's enactment of the Compact.\n\n1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state.

Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.\n\nD. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.\n\nArticle 13. Construction and Severability.\n\nA. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.\n\nB. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a state seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\nC. Notwithstanding subsection B, the Commission may deny a state's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection B of Article 11, terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.\n\nArticle 14. Consistent Effect and Conflict With Other State Laws.\n\nNothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.\n\nAny laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nAll permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n2025, c. 274.",

The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;\n\n2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;\n\n3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;\n\n4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;\n\n5. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and\n\n6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.\n\nB. The general purposes of this Compact are to:\n\n1. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;\n\n2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;\n\n3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;\n\n4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;\n\n5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;\n\n6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and\n\n7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.\n\n2016, c. 108.",

A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.\n\nC.

If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.\n\nE.

Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and shall have the same force and effect as provisions of this Compact.\n\nB. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.\n\nC. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:\n\n1. On the website of the Commission; and\n\n2. On the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.\n\nD. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n\n1. The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n2. The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n3. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n\n4. The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and submit any written comments.\n\nE. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.\n\nF. The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.\n\nG. The Commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.\n\n1. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nH. If no one appears at the public hearing, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.\n\nI. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nJ. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\nK. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n2. Prevent a loss of Commission or party state funds; or\n\n3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.\n\nL. The Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the Commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\n2016, c. 108.",

      "text": "A. Oversight.\n\n1. Each party state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this Compact's purposes and intent.\n\n2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nB. Default, technical assistance and termination.\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and to each of the party states.\n\n4. A state whose membership in this Compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this Compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\nC. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among party states and between party and non-party states.\n\n2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.\n\n3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this Compact:\n\na. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the Compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.\n\nb. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.\n\nD. Enforcement.\n\n1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\n2016, c. 108.",
