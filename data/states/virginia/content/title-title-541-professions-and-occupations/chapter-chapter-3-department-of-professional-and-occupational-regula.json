The Board may recommend to the appropriate agency of the Commonwealth that such procedures be strengthened or it may recommend statutory changes in order to grant to the appropriate state agency the power to provide sufficient inspection and injunction procedures.\n\n3. Registration. -- Whenever it is necessary to determine the impact of the operation of a profession or occupation on the public, the Board may implement a system of registration.\n\n4. Certification. -- When the public requires a substantial basis for relying on the professional services of a practitioner, the Board may implement a system of certification.\n\n5. Licensing. -- Whenever adequate regulation cannot be achieved by means other than licensing, the Board may establish licensing procedures for any particular profession or occupation.\n\nB. In determining the proper degree of regulation, if any, the Board shall determine the following:\n\n1. Whether the practitioner, if unregulated, performs a service for individuals involving a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare.\n\n2. The opinion of a substantial portion of the people who do not practice the particular profession, trade or occupation on the need for regulation.\n\n3. The number of states which have regulatory provisions similar to those proposed.\n\n4. Whether there is sufficient demand for the service for which there is no regulated substitute and this service is required by a substantial portion of the population.\n\n5. Whether the profession or occupation requires high standards of public responsibility, character and performance of each individual engaged in the profession or occupation, as evidenced by established and published codes of ethics.\n\n6. Whether the profession or occupation requires such skill that the public generally is not qualified to select a competent practitioner without some assurance that he has met minimum qualifications.\n\n7. Whether the professional or occupational associations do not adequately protect the public from incompetent, unscrupulous or irresponsible members of the profession or occupation.\n\n8. Whether current laws which pertain to public health, safety and welfare generally are ineffective or inadequate.\n\n9. Whether the characteristics of the profession or occupation make it impractical or impossible to prohibit those practices of the profession or occupation which are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.\n\n10. Whether the practitioner performs a service for others which may have a detrimental effect on third parties relying on the expert knowledge of the practitioner.\n\n1979, c. 408, § 54-1.26; 1988, c. 765.",
