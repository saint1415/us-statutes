Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact States.\n\n4.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nArticle XIII. Date of Implementation of the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact Commission and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendments.\n\nA. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact is enacted into law in the seventh Compact State.
