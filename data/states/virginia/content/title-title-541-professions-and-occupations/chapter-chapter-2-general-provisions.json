If the regulant asserts his right to be heard prior to the board issuing its case decision, the board shall remand the case to an informal fact-finding conference. The notice required by this subdivision shall be sent in a manner that allows for confirmation of delivery or, if agreed to by the parties, through electronic means, provided that the board retains sufficient proof of the electronic delivery, which may be an electronic receipt of delivery, a confirmation that the notice was sent by facsimile, or a certificate of service prepared by the sender confirming the electronic delivery.\n\n10.

In determining whether a criminal conviction directly relates to an occupation or profession, the regulatory board shall consider the following criteria:\n\n1. The nature and seriousness of the crime;\n\n2. The relationship of the crime to the purpose for requiring a license to engage in the occupation;\n\n3.

Such applicant shall pay the cost of the fingerprinting or a criminal records check or both.\n\nThe regulatory board may enter into a contract to obtain the fingerprints and descriptive information as required for submission to the Central Criminal Records Exchange in a manner and format approved by the Central Criminal Records Exchange.\n\nThe Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an applicant's record or notification that no record exists, shall make a report to the regulatory board or its designee, who must belong to a governmental entity. If an applicant is denied a registration, license, or certificate because of the information appearing in his criminal history record, the regulatory board shall notify the applicant in writing of the specific offense or offenses that contributed to such denial, how the criminal history directly relates to the occupation pursuant to subsection B, and how the regulatory board weighed the rehabilitation factors in subsection B when making its decision. The information shall not be disseminated except as provided for in this section.\n\nD. A regulatory board shall consider the criminal information as contained in the applicant's state or national criminal history in lieu of the applicant providing certified copies of such court records in determining whether a criminal conviction directly relates to an occupation or profession or if an applicant is unfit or unsuited to engage in an occupation or profession.
