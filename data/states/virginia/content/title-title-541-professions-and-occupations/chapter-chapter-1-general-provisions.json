The unregulated practice of the profession or occupation can harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for harm is recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument;\n\n2. The practice of the profession or occupation has inherent qualities peculiar to it that distinguish it from ordinary work and labor;\n\n3. The practice of the profession or occupation requires specialized skill or training and the public needs, and will benefit by, assurances of initial and continuing professional and occupational ability; and\n\n4. The public is not effectively protected by other means.\n\nNo regulation of a profession or occupation shall conflict with the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Virginia, the laws of the United States, or the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Periodically and at least annually, all agencies regulating a profession or occupation shall review such regulations to ensure that no conflict exists.\n\n1979, c. 408, § 54-1.17; 1988, c. 765; 2016, c. 467.",
