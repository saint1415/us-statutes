      "text": "The General Assembly hereby enacts, and the Commonwealth of Virginia hereby enters into, the PA Licensure Compact with any and all states legally joining therein according to its terms, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nPa licensure compact.\n\nArticle 1. Purpose.\n\nIn order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of the PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the licensee's qualifying license by other compact participating states. This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.\n\nArticle 2. Definitions.\n\nAs used in this Compact, unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\"Adverse action\" means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a state's laws that is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a PA license or license application or Compact privilege such as license denial, censure, revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, or restriction on the licensee's practice.\n\n\"Compact privilege\" means the authorization granted by a remote state to allow a licensee from another participating state to practice as a PA to provide medical services and other licensed activity to a patient located in the remote state under the remote state's laws and regulations.\n\n\"Conviction\" means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor offense through adjudication or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender.\n\n\"Criminal background check\" means the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information for a license applicant for the purpose of obtaining that applicant's criminal history record information, as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 20.3(d), from the state's criminal history record repository as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 20.3(f).\n\n\"Data system\" means the repository of information about licensees, including but not limited to license status and adverse actions, that is created and administered under the terms of this Compact.\n\n\"Executive committee\" means a group of directors and ex-officio individuals elected or appointed pursuant to subdivision F 2 of Article 7.\n\n\"Impaired practitioner\" means a PA whose practice is adversely affected by health-related condition(s) that impact their ability to practice.\n\n\"Investigative information\" means information, records, or documents received or generated by a licensing board pursuant to an investigation.\n\n\"Jurisprudence requirement\" means the assessment of an individual's knowledge of the laws and rules governing the practice of a PA in a state.\n\n\"License\" means current authorization by a state, other than authorization pursuant to a Compact privilege, for a PA to provide medical services, which would be unlawful without current authorization.\n\n\"Licensee\" means an individual who holds a license from a state to provide medical services as a PA.\n\n\"Licensing board\" means any state entity authorized to license and otherwise regulate PAs.\n\n\"Medical services\" means health care services provided for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, injury, or disease, as defined by a state's laws and regulations.\n\n\"Model compact\" means the model for the PA Licensure Compact on file with the Council of State Governments or other entity as designated by the Commission.\n\n\"Participating state\" means a state that has enacted this Compact.\n\n\"PA\" means an individual who is licensed as a physician assistant in a state. For purposes of this Compact, any other title or status adopted by a state to replace the term \"physician assistant\" shall be deemed synonymous with \"physician assistant\" and shall confer the same rights and responsibilities to the licensee under the provisions of this Compact at the time of its enactment.\n\n\"PA Licensure Compact Commission,\" \"Compact Commission,\" or \"Commission\" mean the national administrative body created pursuant to subsection A of Article 7.\n\n\"Qualifying license\" means an unrestricted license issued by a participating state to provide medical services as a PA.\n\n\"Remote state\" means a participating state where a licensee who is not licensed as a PA is exercising or seeking to exercise the compact privilege.\n\n\"Rule\" means a regulation promulgated by an entity that has the force and effect of law.\n\n\"Significant investigative information\" means investigative information that a licensing board, after an inquiry or investigation that includes notification and an opportunity for the PA to respond if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proven true, would indicate more than a minor infraction.\n\n\"State\" means any state, commonwealth, district, or territory of the United States.\n\nArticle 3. State Participation in This Compact.\n\nA. To participate in this Compact, a participating state shall:\n\n1. License PAs.\n\n2. Participate in the Compact Commission's data system.\n\n3. Have a mechanism in place for receiving and investigating complaints against licensees and license applicants.\n\n4. Notify the Commission, in compliance with the terms of this Compact and Commission rules, of any adverse action against a licensee or license applicant and the existence of significant investigative information regarding a licensee or license applicant.\n\n5.

Grant the compact privilege to a holder of a qualifying license in a participating state.\n\nB. Nothing in this Compact prohibits a participating state from charging a fee for granting the compact privilege.\n\nArticle 4. Compact Privilege.\n\nA. To exercise the compact privilege, a licensee shall:\n\n1. Have graduated from a PA program accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc., or other programs authorized by Commission rule.\n\n2. Hold current NCCPA certification.\n\n3. Have no felony or misdemeanor conviction.\n\n4.

Have a unique identifier as determined by Commission rule.\n\n6. Hold a qualifying license.\n\n7. Have had no revocation of a license or limitation or restriction on any license currently held due to an adverse action.\n\n8. If a licensee has had a limitation or restriction on a license or compact privilege due to an adverse action, two years shall have elapsed from the date on which the license or compact privilege is no longer limited or restricted due to the adverse action.\n\n9. If a compact privilege has been revoked or is limited or restricted in a participating state for conduct that would not be a basis for disciplinary action in a participating state in which the licensee is practicing or applying to practice under a compact privilege, that participating state shall have the discretion not to consider such action as an adverse action requiring the denial or removal of a compact privilege in that state.\n\n10. Notify the Compact Commission that the licensee is seeking the compact privilege in a remote state.\n\n11. Meet any jurisprudence requirement of a remote state in which the licensee is seeking to practice under the compact privilege and pay any fees applicable to satisfying the jurisprudence requirement.\n\n12. Report to the Commission any adverse action taken by a nonparticipating state within 30 days after the action is taken.\n\nB. The compact privilege is valid until the expiration or revocation of the qualifying license unless terminated pursuant to an adverse action. The licensee shall also comply with all of the requirements of subsection A to maintain the compact privilege in a remote state. If the participating state takes adverse action against a qualifying license, the licensee shall lose the compact privilege in any remote state in which the licensee has a compact privilege until all of the following occur:\n\n1. The license is no longer limited or restricted; and\n\n2. Two years have elapsed from the date on which the license is no longer limited or restricted due to the adverse action.\n\nC. Once a restricted or limited license satisfies the requirements of subdivisions B 1 and 2, the licensee shall meet the requirements of subsection A to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.\n\nD. For each remote state in which a PA seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the PA shall satisfy all requirements imposed by such state in granting or renewing such authority.\n\nArticle 5. Designation of the State from Which Licensee is Applying for a Compact Privilege.\n\nUpon a licensee's application for a compact privilege, the licensee shall identify to the Commission the participating state from which the licensee is applying, in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Commission, and subject to the following requirements:\n\n1. When applying for a compact privilege, the licensee shall provide the Commission with the address of the licensee's primary residence and thereafter shall immediately report to the Commission any change in the address of the licensee's primary residence.\n\n2. When applying for a compact privilege, the licensee is required to consent to accept service of process by mail at the licensee's primary residence on file with the Commission with respect to any action brought against the licensee by the Commission or a participating state, including a subpoena, with respect to any action brought or investigation conducted by the Commission or a participating state.\n\nArticle 6. Adverse Actions.\n\nA. A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have exclusive power to impose adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that participating state.\n\nB. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to do all of the following:\n\n1. Take adverse action against a PA's compact privilege within that state to remove a licensee's compact privilege or take other action necessary under applicable law to protect the health and safety of its citizens.\n\n2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another participating state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.\n\n3. Notwithstanding subdivision 2, subpoenas may not be issued by a participating state to gather evidence of conduct in another state that is lawful in that other state for the purpose of taking adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact privilege in that participating state.\n\n4. Nothing in this Compact authorizes a participating state to impose discipline against a PA's compact privilege or to deny an application for a compact privilege in that participating state for the individual's otherwise lawful practice in another state.\n\nC. For purposes of taking adverse action, the participating state that issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the participating state that issued the qualifying license. In so doing, that participating state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.\n\nD. A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.\n\nE. A participating state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of a remote state, provided that the participating state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.\n\nF. Joint investigations.\n\n1. In addition to the authority granted to a participating state by its respective state PA laws and regulations or other applicable state law, any participating state may participate with other participating states in joint investigations of licensees.\n\n2. Participating states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under this Compact.\n\nG. If an adverse action is taken against a PA's qualifying license, the PA's compact privilege in all remote states shall be deactivated until two years have elapsed after all restrictions have been removed from the state license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state that issued the qualifying license that impose adverse action against a PA's license shall include a statement that the PA's compact privilege is deactivated in all participating states during the pendency of the order.\n\nH. If any participating state takes adverse action, it promptly shall notify the administrator of the data system.\n\n(7) Article 7. Establishment of the PA Licensure Compact Commission.\n\nA. The participating states hereby create and establish a joint government agency and national administrative body known as the PA Licensure Compact Commission. The Commission is an instrumentality of the compact states acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any one state. The Commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date of the Compact as set forth in subsection A of Article 11.\n\nB. Membership, voting, and meetings.\n\n1. Each participating state shall have and be limited to one delegate selected by that participating state's licensing board or, if the state has more than one licensing board, selected collectively by the participating state's licensing boards.\n\n2. The delegate shall be either:\n\na. A current PA, physician, or public member of a licensing board or PA council/committee; or\n\nb. An administrator of a licensing board.\n\n3.

The Commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the Commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.\n\n3.

Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in any proceedings as authorized by Commission rules.\n\n5. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.\n\n6. Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional misconduct, negligence, or other such civil action pertaining to the practice of a PA. All such matters shall be determined exclusively by state law other than this Compact.\n\n7.

Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any participating state shall only be available to other participating states.\n\nD. The Commission shall promptly notify all participating states of any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a license that has been reported to it. This adverse action information shall be available to any other participating state.\n\nE. Participating states contributing information to the data system may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such information shall be reported to the Commission through the data system.\n\nF. Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the participating state contributing the information shall be removed from the data system upon reporting of such by the participating state to the Commission.\n\nG. The records and information provided to a participating state pursuant to this Compact or through the data system, when certified by the Commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the Commission, and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a participating state.\n\nArticle 9. Rulemaking.\n\nA. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for each rule.\n\nB. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer this Compact and achieve its purposes. A Commission rule shall be invalid and have not force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.\n\nC. The rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each participating state, provided however that where the rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services a PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.\n\nD. If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a Commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this Compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the Compact.\n\nE. Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.\n\nF. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:\n\n1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform; and\n\n2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and\n\n3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by rule specify.\n\nG. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n\n1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing on the proposed rule and the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n2. The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n3. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person and the date by which written comments must be received; and\n\n4. The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide any written comments.\n\nH. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.\n\nI. If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the Commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.\n\n1. All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall as directed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, not less than five business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the Commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.\n\n2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.\n\n3. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon request.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nJ. Following the public hearing, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments timely received.\n\nK. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\n1. If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the Commission's website.\n\n2. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.\n\n3. The Commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.\n\n4. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after the Commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.\n\nL. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours prior notice, without the opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. for the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the Commission in order to:\n\n1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n2. Prevent a loss of Commission or participating state funds;\n\n3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Commission rule that is established by federal law or rule; or\n\n4. Protect public health and safety.\n\nM. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\nN. No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.\n\nArticle 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement.\n\nA. Oversight.\n\n1. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.\n\n2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.\n\n3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or the Commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the Commission, this Compact, or Commission rules.\n\nB. Default, technical assistance, and termination.\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the Commission rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and to the licensing board(s) of each of the participating states.\n\n4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the Compact by the Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n7. Upon the termination of a state's participation in the Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:\n\na. Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.\n\nb. Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period ends, in which case the compact privilege shall continue.\n\nC. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a participating state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.\n\n2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\nD. Enforcement.\n\n1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and rules of the Commission.\n\n2. If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nE. Legal action against the Commission.\n\n1. A participating state may initiate legal action against the Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n2. No person other than a participating state shall enforce this Compact against the Commission.\n\nArticle 11. Date of Implementation of the PA Licensure Compact Commission.\n\nA. This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which this Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.\n\n1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the Compact prior to the Commission convening (\"charter participating states\") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different than the model compact.\n\na. A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection B of Article 10.\n\nb. If any participating state later withdraws from the Compact or its participation is terminated, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than seven. Participating states enacting the Compact subsequent to the Commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in subdivision C 21 of Article 7 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.\n\n2. Participating states enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in subdivision C 21 of Article 7 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.\n\n3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.\n\nB. Any state that joins this Compact shall be subject to the Commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in that state.\n\nC. Any participating state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n1. A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of the 180 days.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board(s) of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this Compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.\n\nD. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.\n\nE. This Compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as determined by the Commission.\n\nArticle 12. Construction and Severability.\n\nA. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.\n\nB. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\nC. Notwithstanding subsection B or this subsection, the Commission may deny a state's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection B of Article 10, terminate a participating state's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the Compact, a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nArticle 13. Binding Effect of Compact.\n\nA. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with this Compact.\n\nB. Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nC. All agreements between the Commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms.",

The practice of occupational therapy occurs in the state where the patient/client is located at the time of the patient/client encounter. The Compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure.\n\nThis Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:\n\n1. Increase public access to occupational therapy services by providing for the mutual recognition of other member state licenses;\n\n2. Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety;\n\n3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating multi-state occupational therapy practice;\n\n4. Support spouses of relocating military members;\n\n5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information between member states;\n\n6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a compact privilege in that state accountable to that state's practice standards; and\n\n7.

If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\nArticle XI.\n\nOversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement.\n\nA. Oversight.\n\n1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.\n\n2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.\n\n3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nB. Default, technical assistance, and termination.\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.\n\n4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\nC. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.\n\n2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\nD. Enforcement.\n\nThe Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.\n\nBy majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\nThe remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nArticle XII.\n\nDate of Implementation of the Interstate Commission for Occupational Therapy Practice and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment.\n\nA. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.\n\nB. Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.\n\nC. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's occupational therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nD. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any occupational therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.\n\nE. This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.\n\nArticle XIII.\n\nConstruction and Severability.\n\nThis Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nArticle XIV.\n\nBinding Effect of Compact and Other Laws.\n\nA. A licensee providing occupational therapy in a remote state under the compact privilege shall function within the laws and regulations of the remote state.\n\nB. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the Compact.\n\nC. Any laws in a member state in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nD. Any lawful actions of the Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the member states.\n\nE. All agreements between the Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nF. In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.\n\n2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 242.",

A certified registered nurse anesthetist shall practice under the supervision of a licensed doctor of medicine, osteopathy, podiatry, or dentistry. An advanced practice registered nurse who is appointed as a medical examiner pursuant to § 32.1-282 shall practice in collaboration with a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathic medicine who has been appointed to serve as a medical examiner pursuant to § 32.1-282.

Practice agreements shall include provisions for (i) periodic review of health records, which may include visits to the site where health care is delivered, in the manner and at the frequency determined by the advanced practice registered nurse and the patient care team physician and (ii) input from appropriate health care providers in complex clinical cases and patient emergencies and for referrals. Evidence of a practice agreement shall be maintained by an advanced practice registered nurse and provided to the Boards upon request. For advanced practice registered nurses providing care to patients within a hospital or health care system, the practice agreement may be included as part of documents delineating the advanced practice registered nurse's clinical privileges or the electronic or written delineation of duties and responsibilities in collaboration and consultation with a patient care team physician.\n\nE. The Boards of Medicine and Nursing may issue a license by endorsement to an applicant to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse if the applicant has been licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse under the laws of another state and, pursuant to regulations of the Boards, the applicant meets the qualifications for licensure required of advanced practice registered nurses in the Commonwealth. An advanced practice registered nurse to whom a license is issued by endorsement may practice without a practice agreement with a patient care team physician pursuant to subsection I if such application provides an attestation to the Boards that the applicant has completed the equivalent of at least three years of full-time experience, as determined by the Boards, in accordance with the laws of the state in which the nurse practitioner was licensed.\n\nF. Pending the outcome of the next National Specialty Examination, the Boards may jointly grant temporary licensure to advanced practice registered nurses.\n\nG. In the event a physician who is serving as a patient care team physician dies, becomes disabled, retires from active practice, surrenders his license or has it suspended or revoked by the Board, or relocates his practice such that he is no longer able to serve, or for other good cause, and an advanced practice registered nurse is unable to enter into a new practice agreement with another patient care team physician, the advanced practice registered nurse may continue to practice upon notification to the designee or his alternate of the Boards and receipt of such notification. Such advanced practice registered nurse may continue to treat patients without a patient care team physician for an initial period not to exceed 60 days, provided that the advanced practice registered nurse continues to prescribe only those drugs previously authorized by the practice agreement with such physician and to have access to appropriate input from appropriate health care providers in complex clinical cases and patient emergencies and for referrals. The designee or his alternate of the Boards shall grant permission for the advanced practice registered nurse to continue practice under this subsection for another 60 days, provided that the advanced practice registered nurse provides evidence of efforts made to secure another patient care team physician and of access to physician input. At the conclusion of the second 60-day period, provided that the advanced practice registered nurse provides evidence of the continued efforts to secure another patient care team physician and of access to physician input, the designee or his alternate of the Boards may grant permission for the advanced practice registered nurse to continue practicing under the management and leadership of a nurse practitioner licensed by the Boards of Medicine and Nursing who (i) meets the requirements of subsection I, (ii) routinely practiced with a patient population and in a practice area within the category for which the advanced practice registered nurse was certified and licensed, and (iii) has been authorized to practice without a written or electronic practice agreement for at least three years.\n\nH. Every certified nurse midwife shall practice in accordance with regulations adopted by the Boards and consistent with the Standards for the Practice of Midwifery set by the American College of Nurse-Midwives governing such practice. A certified nurse midwife who has practiced fewer than 1,000 hours shall practice in consultation with a licensed physician or an independent practice midwife, in accordance with a practice agreement. Such practice agreement shall address the availability of the licensed physician or independent practice midwife for routine and urgent consultation on patient care. Evidence of the practice agreement shall be maintained by the certified nurse midwife and provided to the Boards upon request. A certified nurse midwife who has completed 1,000 hours of practice as a certified nurse midwife may practice without a practice agreement upon receipt by the certified nurse midwife of an attestation from the licensed physician or independent practice midwife with whom the certified nurse midwife has entered into a practice agreement stating (i) that such licensed physician or independent practice midwife has provided consultation to the certified nurse midwife pursuant to a practice agreement meeting the requirements of this section and (ii) the period of time for which such licensed physician or independent practice midwife practiced in collaboration and consultation with the certified nurse midwife pursuant to the practice agreement. A certified nurse midwife authorized to practice without a practice agreement shall consult and collaborate with and refer patients to such other health care providers as may be appropriate for the care of the patient.\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, \"independent practice midwife\" means a licensed certified midwife who is authorized to practice without a practice agreement pursuant subsection D of § 54.1-2957.04 and has practiced independently for two years or a certified nurse midwife who is authorized to practice without a practice agreement pursuant to this subsection and has practiced independently for two years.\n\nI. A nurse practitioner who has completed the equivalent of at least three years of full-time clinical experience, as determined by the Boards, may practice in the practice category in which he is certified and licensed without a written or electronic practice agreement upon receipt by the nurse practitioner of an attestation from either (i) the patient care team physician or (ii) an attesting nurse practitioner who assumed management and leadership of a nurse practitioner pursuant to subsection G and has met the requirements of this subsection for at least three years stating (a) that the patient care team physician or attesting nurse practitioner has served as a patient care team physician or attesting nurse practitioner, respectively, on a patient care team with the nurse practitioner pursuant to a practice agreement meeting the requirements of this section and § 54.1-2957.01; (b) that while a party to such practice agreement, the patient care team physician or attesting nurse practitioner routinely practiced with a patient population and in a practice area included within the category for which the nurse practitioner was certified and licensed; and (c) the period of time for which the patient care team physician or attesting nurse practitioner practiced with the nurse practitioner under such a practice agreement.

For purposes of this article, cardiopulmonary resuscitation shall include cardiac compression, endotracheal intubation and other advanced airway management, artificial ventilation, and defibrillation and related procedures. As the terms \"advance directive\" and \"Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order\" are used in this article, a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order is not and shall not be construed as an advance directive.\n\n\"Health care\" means the furnishing of services to any individual for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing, or healing human illness, injury or physical disability, including but not limited to, medications; surgery; blood transfusions; chemotherapy; radiation therapy; admission to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, or other health care facility; psychiatric or other mental health treatment; and life-prolonging procedures and palliative care.\n\n\"Health care provider\" shall have the same meaning as provided in § 8.01-581.1.\n\n\"Incapable of making an informed decision\" means the inability of an adult patient, because of mental illness, intellectual disability, or any other mental or physical disorder that precludes communication or impairs judgment, to make an informed decision about providing, continuing, withholding or withdrawing a specific health care treatment or course of treatment because he is unable to understand the nature, extent or probable consequences of the proposed health care decision, or to make a rational evaluation of the risks and benefits of alternatives to that decision. For purposes of this article, persons who are deaf, dysphasic or have other communication disorders, who are otherwise mentally competent and able to communicate by means other than speech, shall not be considered incapable of making an informed decision.\n\n\"Life-prolonging procedure\" means any medical procedure, treatment or intervention which (i) utilizes mechanical or other artificial means to sustain, restore or supplant a spontaneous vital function, or is otherwise of such a nature as to afford a patient no reasonable expectation of recovery from a terminal condition and (ii) when applied to a patient in a terminal condition, would serve only to prolong the dying process.

A written advance directive may be submitted to the Advance Health Care Planning Registry, pursuant to Article 9 (§ 54.1-2994 et seq.).\n\nFurther, any adult capable of making an informed decision who has been diagnosed by his attending physician as being in a terminal condition may make an oral advance directive (i) directing the specific health care the declarant does or does not authorize in the event the declarant is incapable of making an informed decision, and (ii) appointing an agent to make health care decisions for the declarant under the circumstances stated in the advance directive if the declarant should be determined to be incapable of making an informed decision.

If an advance directive has been submitted to the Advance Health Care Planning Registry pursuant to Article 9 (§ 54.1-2994 et seq.), it shall be the responsibility of the declarant to provide his attending physician, legal representative, or other person with the information necessary to access the advance directive. In the event the declarant is comatose, incapacitated or otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication, any other person may notify the physician of the existence of an advance directive and, if applicable, the fact that it has been submitted to the Advance Health Care Planning Registry. An attending physician who is so notified shall promptly make the advance directive or a copy of the advance directive, if written, or the fact of the advance directive, if oral, a part of the declarant's medical records.\n\nIn the event that any portion of an advance directive is invalid or illegal, such invalidity or illegality shall not affect the remaining provisions of the advance directive.\n\n1983, c. 532, § 54-325.8:3; 1988, c. 765; 1992, cc. 748, 772; 1997, c. 801; 2008, cc. 301, 696; 2009, cc. 211, 268; 2010, c. 16; 2021, Sp.

A determination that a patient is incapable of making an informed decision may apply to a particular health care decision, to a specified set of health care decisions, or to all health care decisions. No person shall be deemed incapable of making an informed decision based solely on a particular clinical diagnosis.\n\nB. Except as provided in subsection C, prior to providing, continuing, withholding, or withdrawing health care pursuant to an authorization that has been obtained or will be sought pursuant to this article and prior to, or as soon as reasonably practicable after initiating health care for which authorization has been obtained or will be sought pursuant to this article, and no less frequently than every 180 days while the need for health care continues, the attending physician shall certify in writing upon personal examination of the patient that the patient is incapable of making an informed decision regarding health care and shall obtain written certification from a capacity reviewer that, based upon a personal examination of the patient, the patient is incapable of making an informed decision. However, certification by a capacity reviewer shall not be required if the patient is unconscious or experiencing a profound impairment of consciousness due to trauma, stroke, or other acute physiological condition. The capacity reviewer providing written certification that a patient is incapable of making an informed decision, if required, shall not be otherwise currently involved in the treatment of the person assessed, unless an independent capacity reviewer is not reasonably available. The cost of the assessment shall be considered for all purposes a cost of the patient's health care.\n\nC. If a person has executed an advance directive granting an agent the authority to consent to the person's admission to a facility as defined in § 37.2-100 for mental health treatment and if the advance directive so authorizes, the person's agent may exercise such authority after a determination that the person is incapable of making an informed decision regarding such admission has been made by (i) the attending physician, (ii) a psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist, (iii) a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, (iv) a licensed physician assistant, (v) a licensed clinical social worker, or (vi) a designee of the local community services board as defined in § 37.2-809. Such determination shall be made in writing following an in-person examination of the person and certified by the physician, psychiatrist, licensed clinical psychologist, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, licensed physician assistant, licensed clinical social worker, or designee of the local community services board who performed the examination prior to admission or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Admission of a person to a facility as defined in § 37.2-100 for mental health treatment upon the authorization of the person's agent shall be subject to the requirements of § 37.2-805.1. When a person has been admitted to a facility for mental health treatment upon the authorization of an agent following such a determination, such agent may authorize specific health care for the person, consistent with the provisions of the person's advance directive, only upon a determination that the person is incapable of making an informed decision regarding such health care in accordance with subsection B.\n\nD. If, at any time, a patient is determined to be incapable of making an informed decision, the patient shall be notified, as soon as practical and to the extent he is capable of receiving such notice, that such determination has been made before providing, continuing, withholding, or withdrawing health care as authorized by this article. Such notice shall also be provided, as soon as practical, to the patient's agent or person authorized by § 54.1-2986 to make health care decisions on his behalf.\n\nE.

A determination of the medical or ethical inappropriateness of proposed health care shall be based solely on the patient's medical condition and not on the patient's age or other demographic status, disability, or diagnosis of persistent vegetative state.\n\nIn cases in which a physician's determination that proposed health care, including life-sustaining treatment, is medically or ethically inappropriate is contrary to the request of the patient, the terms of a patient's advance directive, the decision of an agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986, or a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order, the physician or his designee shall document the physician's determination in the patient's medical record, make a reasonable effort to inform the patient or the patient's agent or person with decision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986 of such determination and the reasons therefor in writing, and provide a copy of the hospital's written policies regarding review of decisions regarding the medical or ethical appropriateness of proposed health care established pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127.\n\nIf the conflict remains unresolved, the physician shall make a reasonable effort to transfer the patient to another physician or facility that is willing to comply with the request of the patient, the terms of the advance directive, the decision of an agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986, or a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order and shall cooperate in transferring the patient to the physician or facility identified. The physician shall provide the patient or his agent or person with decision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986 a reasonable time of not less than 14 days after the date on which the decision regarding the medical or ethical inappropriateness of the proposed treatment is documented in the patient's medical record in accordance with the hospital's written policy developed pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127 to effect such transfer. During this period, (i) the physician shall continue to provide any life-sustaining treatment to the patient that is reasonably available to such physician, as requested by the patient or his agent or person with decision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986, and (ii) the hospital in which the patient is receiving life-sustaining treatment shall facilitate prompt access to the patient's medical record pursuant to § 32.1-127.1:03.\n\nIf, at the end of the 14-day period, the conflict remains unresolved despite compliance with the hospital's written policy established pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127 and the physician has been unable to identify another physician or facility willing to provide the care requested by the patient, the terms of the advance directive, or the decision of the agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 to which to transfer the patient despite reasonable efforts, the physician may cease to provide the treatment that the physician has determined to be medically or ethically inappropriate subject to the right of court review by any party. However, artificial nutrition and hydration may be withdrawn or withheld only if, on the basis of physician's reasonable medical judgment, providing such artificial nutrition and hydration would (a) hasten the patient's death, (b) be medically ineffective in prolonging life, or (c) be contrary to the clearly documented wishes of the patient, the terms of the patient's advance directive, or the decision of an agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 regarding the withholding of artificial nutrition or hydration. In all cases, care directed toward the patient's pain and comfort shall be provided.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall require the provision of health care that the physician is physically or legally unable to provide or health care that the physician is physically or legally unable to provide without thereby denying the same health care to another patient.\n\nD. Nothing in this article shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia or to permit any affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life other than to permit the natural process of dying.\n\nE. Compliance with the requirements of this section shall not be admissible to prove a violation of or compliance with the standard of care as set forth in § 8.01-581.20.\n\n1983, c. 532, § 54-325.8:10; 1988, c. 765; 1992, cc. 748, 772; 1999, c. 814; 2000, cc. 590, 598; 2009, cc. 211, 268; 2018, cc. 368, 565.",
