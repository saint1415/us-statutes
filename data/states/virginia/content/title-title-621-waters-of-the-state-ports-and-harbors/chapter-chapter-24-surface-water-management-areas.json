Instream beneficial uses include but are not limited to protection of fish and wildlife habitat, maintenance of waste assimilation, recreation, navigation, and cultural and aesthetic values. Offstream beneficial uses include but are not limited to domestic (including public water supply), agricultural, electric power generation, commercial, and industrial uses. Domestic and other existing beneficial uses shall be considered the highest priority beneficial uses.\n\n\"Board\" means the State Water Control Board. However, when used outside the context of the promulgation of regulations, including regulations to establish general permits, pursuant to this chapter, \"Board\" means the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\"Nonconsumptive use\" means the use of water withdrawn from a stream in such a manner that it is returned to the stream without substantial diminution in quantity at or near the point from which it was taken and would not result in or exacerbate low flow conditions.\n\n\"Surface water withdrawal permit\" means a document issued by the Board evidencing the right to withdraw surface water.\n\n\"Surface water management area\" means a geographically defined surface water area in which the Board has deemed the levels or supply of surface water to be potentially adverse to public welfare, health and safety.\n\n\"Surface water\" means any water in the Commonwealth, except ground water, as defined in § 62.1-255.\n\n1989, c. 721; 1992, c. 812; 2022, c. 356.",

No political subdivision or investor-owned water company permitted by the Department of Health shall be required to obtain a surface water withdrawal permit for:\n\n1. Any withdrawal in existence on July 1, 1989; however, a permit shall be required in a declared surface water management area before the daily rate of any such existing withdrawal is increased beyond the maximum daily withdrawal made before July 1, 1989.\n\n2. Any withdrawal not in existence on July 1, 1989, if the person proposing to make the withdrawal has received a § 401 certification from the State Water Control Board pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Water Act to install any necessary withdrawal structures and make such withdrawal; however, a permit shall be required in any surface water management area before any such withdrawal is increased beyond the amount authorized by the said certification.\n\n3. Any withdrawal in existence on July 1, 1989, from an instream impoundment of water used for public water supply purposes; however, during periods when permit conditions in a surface water management area are in force under regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to § 62.1-249, and when the rate of flow of natural surface water into the impoundment is equal to or less than the average flow of natural surface water at that location, the Board may require the release of water from the impoundment at a rate not exceeding the existing rate of flow of natural surface water into the impoundment.\n\nWithdrawals by a political subdivision or investor-owned water company permitted by the Department of Health shall be affected by subdivision 3 of subsection B only at the option of that political subdivision or investor-owned water company.\n\nTo qualify for any exemption in subsection B of this section, the political subdivision making the withdrawal, or the political subdivision served by an authority making the withdrawal, shall have instituted a water conservation program approved by the Board which includes: (i) use of water saving plumbing fixtures in new and renovated plumbing as provided under the Uniform Statewide Building Code; (ii) a water loss reduction program; (iii) a water use education program; and (iv) ordinances prohibiting waste of water generally and providing for mandatory water use restrictions, with penalties, during water shortage emergencies. The Board shall review all such water conservation programs to ensure compliance with (i) through (iv) of this paragraph.\n\nC. No existing beneficial consumptive user shall be required to obtain a surface water withdrawal permit for:\n\n1. Any withdrawal in existence on July 1, 1989; however, a permit shall be required in a declared surface water management area before the daily rate of any such existing withdrawal is increased beyond the maximum daily withdrawal made before July 1, 1989.\n\n2. Any withdrawal not in existence on July 1, 1989, if the person proposing to make the withdrawal has received a § 401 certification from the State Water Control Board pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Water Act to install any necessary withdrawal structures and make such withdrawal; however, a permit shall be required in any surface water management area before any such withdrawal is increased beyond the amount authorized by the said certification.\n\nTo qualify for either exemption in subsection C of this section, the beneficial consumptive user shall have instituted a water management program approved by the Board which includes: (i) use of water-saving plumbing; (ii) a water loss reduction program; (iii) a water use education program; and (iv) mandatory reductions during water shortage emergencies. However, these reductions shall be on an equitable basis with other uses exempted under subsection B of this section. The Board shall review all such water management programs to ensure compliance with (i) through (iv) of this paragraph.\n\nD. The Board shall issue certificates for any withdrawals exempted pursuant to subsections B and C of this section. Such certificates shall include conservation or management programs as conditions thereof.\n\n1989, c. 721; 1993, c. 213; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 532.",

The Board shall cause notice of the surface water management area to be published in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the area, and shall mail a copy of its decision to the mayor or chairman of the governing body of each county, city or town within which any part of the area lies, or which is known by the Board to make offstream use of water from the area, and to the chief administrative officer of any federal facility known by the Board to be using water from within the area.

In determining the level of flow in need of protection, the Board shall consider, among other things, recreational and aesthetic factors and the potential for substantial and long-term adverse impact on fish and wildlife found in that particular surface water management area. Should this determination indicate a need to restrict water withdrawal, the Board shall consider, among other things, the availability of alternative water supplies, the feasibility of water storage or other mitigation measures, and the socioeconomic impacts of such restrictions on the potentially affected water users and on the citizens of the Commonwealth in general.\n\nIn its permit decision, the Board shall attempt to balance offstream and instream water uses so that the welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth is maximized without imposing unreasonable burdens on any individual water user or water-using group. The decision to implement this balance may consist of approval of withdrawal without restriction, approval subject to conditions designed to protect instream uses from unacceptable adverse effects, or disapproval of the withdrawal.\n\nPermit conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) maximum amounts which may be withdrawn, (ii) times of the day or year during which withdrawals may occur, and (iii) requirements for voluntary and mandatory conservation measures.\n\nB. In considering whether to issue, modify, revoke, or deny a permit under this section, the Board shall consider:\n\n1. The number of persons using a stream and the object, extent and necessity of their respective withdrawals or uses;\n\n2. The nature and size of the stream;\n\n3. The types of businesses or activities to which the various uses are related;\n\n4. The importance and necessity of the uses claimed by permit applicants, or of the water uses of the area and the extent of any injury or detriment caused or expected to be caused to instream or offstream water uses;\n\n5. The effects on beneficial uses; and\n\n6. Any other relevant factors.\n\nC. Permits shall be transferable among users, subject to approval by the Board.\n\nD. In developing regulations governing the issuance of permits, the Board shall prioritize among types of users. Domestic and existing uses shall be given the highest priority in the issuance of permits for other beneficial uses. Included among existing uses shall be any projected use which has been relied upon in the development of an industrial project and for which a permit has been obtained by January 1, 1989, pursuant to § 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n\n1989, c. 721.",
