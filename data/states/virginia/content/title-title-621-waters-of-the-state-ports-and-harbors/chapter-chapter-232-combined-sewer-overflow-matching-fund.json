      "text": "There is hereby established the Combined Sewer Overflow Matching Fund (\"Fund\") to match federal money for purposes of providing grants to localities for CSO projects. The Fund shall be established out of the sums appropriated from time to time by the General Assembly for the purpose of matching federal funds allocated to Virginia for CSO controls. The Fund, and all income from the investment of moneys held in the Fund and any other sums designated for deposit to the Fund from any source, public or private, shall be set apart as a permanent and perpetual fund, subject to liquidation only upon the solution of Virginia's combined sewer overflow problems, as may be determined by the General Assembly. The Fund shall be administered and managed by the Virginia Resources Authority, subject to the right of the State Water Control Board, following consultation with the Authority, to direct the distribution of grants from the Fund to particular local governments. The State Water Control Board may establish such terms and conditions on any grant as it deems appropriate, and grants shall be disbursed from the Fund by the Virginia Resources Authority in accordance with the written direction of the State Water Control Board.\n\n1992, c. 363.",
