The Board of Commissioners of the Authority shall develop and adopt personnel rules, policies, and procedures to give its employees grievance rights, ensure that employment decisions shall be based upon the merit and fitness of applicants, and prohibit discrimination because of race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.\n\nB. The Authority shall issue a written notice to its employees regarding the Authority's status. The date upon which such written notice is issued shall be referred to herein as the \"option date.\" Each employee may, by written request made within 180 days of the option date, elect not to become employed by the Authority. Any employee of the Virginia Port Authority who: (i) elects not to become employed by the Authority and who is not reemployed by any other department, institution, board, commission or agency of the Commonwealth; (ii) is not offered the opportunity to remain employed by the Authority; or (iii) is not offered a position with the Authority for which the employee is qualified or is offered a position that requires relocation or a reduction in salary, shall be eligible for the severance benefits conferred by the provisions of the Workforce Transition Act (§ 2.2-3200 et seq.). Any employee who accepts employment with the Authority shall not be considered to be involuntarily separated from state employment and shall not be eligible for the severance benefits conferred by the Workforce Transition Act.\n\nC. Any employee of the Authority who is a member of any plan providing health insurance coverage pursuant to Chapter 28 (§ 2.2-2800 et seq.) of Title 2.2, shall continue to be a member of such health insurance plan under the same terms and conditions. Notwithstanding subsection A of § 2.2-2818, the costs of providing health insurance coverage to such employees who elect to continue to be members of the state employees' health insurance plan shall be paid by the Authority. Alternatively, an employee may elect to become a member of any health insurance plan established by the Authority. The Authority is authorized to: (i) establish a health insurance plan for the benefit of its employees and (ii) enter into agreements with the Department of Human Resource Management providing for the coverage of its employees under the state employees' health insurance plan, provided that such agreement requires the Authority to pay the costs of providing health insurance coverage under such plan.\n\nD. Any retired employee of the Authority shall be eligible to receive the health insurance credit set forth in § 51.1-1400 provided the retired employee meets the eligibility criteria set forth in that section.\n\nE. Any Authority employee who is a member of the Virginia Retirement System or other retirement plan as authorized by Article 4 (§ 51.1-125 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 51.1, shall continue to be a member of the Virginia Retirement System or other authorized retirement plan under the same terms and conditions. Alternatively, such employee may elect to become a member of the retirement program established by the Authority for the benefit of its employees pursuant to § 51.1-126.4. The following rules shall apply:\n\n1. The Authority shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions to the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan for retirement and group life insurance in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (§ 51.1-124.1 et seq.) of Title 51.1 for any employee who elects to remain a member of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan.\n\n2. Employees who elect to become members of the alternative retirement plan established by the Authority pursuant to § 51.1-126.4 shall be given full credit for their creditable service as defined in § 51.1-124.3, and vesting and benefit accrual under the retirement plan. For any such employee, employment with the Authority shall be treated as employment with any nonparticipating employer for purposes of the Virginia Retirement System or other retirement plan authorized pursuant to Article 4 (§ 51.1-125 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 51.1.\n\n3. For employees who elect to become members of the alternative retirement plan established by the Authority, the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized plan shall transfer to the alternative retirement plan established by the Authority, assets equal to the actuarially determined present value of the accrued basic benefits as of the transfer date. For purposes hereof, the \"basic benefits\" means the benefits accrued under the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan based on creditable service and average final compensation as defined in § 51.1-124.3. The actuarial present value shall be determined by using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used in determining the funding needs of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan so that the transfer of assets to the alternative retirement plan established by the Authority will have no effect on the funded status and financial stability of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan. The Authority shall reimburse the Virginia Retirement System for the cost of actuarial services necessary to determine the present value of the accrued basic benefit of employees who transfer to an Authority retirement plan.\n\n4. The Authority may provide that employees of the Authority who are eligible to participate in the deferred compensation plan sponsored by the Authority shall be enrolled automatically in such plan, unless such employee elects, in a manner prescribed by the Board, not to participate. The amount of the deferral under the automatic enrollment and the group of employees to which the automatic enrollment shall apply shall be set by the Board; provided however, that such employees are provided the opportunity to increase or decrease the amount of the deferral in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\n1997, c. 232; 2000, cc. 66, 657; 2008, cc. 325, 621; 2020, c. 1137.",

The funds of the trust or similar arrangement shall be deemed separate, and independent trust funds shall be segregated from all other funds of the Authority, and shall be invested and administered solely in the interests of the active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) entitled to postemployment benefits other than pensions covered by the Fund.\n\nB. The Authority may make appropriations to any such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the Authority may require active and former employees covered by a postemployment benefit program to contribute to the trust or equivalent arrangement through payments or deductions from their wages, salaries, or pensions.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to inhibit the Authority's right to revise or discontinue its plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for its active and former officers and employees as it may deem necessary. If all plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement is established are repealed or terminated by the Authority, then there shall be no continuing responsibility for the Authority to continue to make appropriations to such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the assets of such trust or equivalent arrangement shall be used to provide any benefits continuing to be due to active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) under such plans or programs. If there are no active or former employees (or dependents or beneficiaries) due a benefit under any plan or program providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement was established, then any remaining assets may revert to the Authority.\n\nD. Postemployment benefits other than pensions shall be defined by the Authority pursuant to applicable accounting standards and law. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, hearing, life or accident insurance (not provided through a pension plan), long-term care benefits, long-term disability benefits (not covered under a pension plan) provided to individuals who have terminated their service and to the dependents of such individuals, and may be provided by purchasing insurance, by a program of self-insurance, or by a combination of both. However, postemployment benefits other than pensions shall not include defined benefit pension plans for retirees and eligible dependents of retirees, termination benefits or other pension benefits. Such postemployment benefits other than pensions may be provided to the officers and employees or to their dependents, estates, or designated beneficiaries. Any benefits arising from any postemployment benefits other than pension programs shall be clearly defined and strictly construed.\n\nE. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the moneys and other property comprising the trust or equivalent arrangement established hereunder and the moneys or other properties comprising the retirement program established pursuant to § 51.1-126.4 shall be invested, reinvested and managed by the Authority or the trust company or bank having powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth who is selected by the Board to act as a trustee for the fund, with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with the same aims. Such investments shall be diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. Such investments shall not be limited by Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et seq.) of Title 2.2.\n\n2008, cc. 597, 622.",

For purposes of the limitations imposed by subsections B and C of § 62.1-140, contingent obligations to reimburse providers for amounts drawn under credit facilities, letters of credit, lines of credit, guarantees, standby bond purchase agreements, or other credit or liquidity enhancement facilities, including any such enhancement facility obtained by the Authority for deposit into any reserve account or fund relating to any bonds, shall not constitute bonds.\n\nFor purposes of the limitations imposed by subsections B and C of § 62.1-140, the term \"revenue bonds\" means bonds for which only the revenues of port facilities are pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds.\n\nB. The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any Authority project for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction or control of port facilities or of any portion or portions thereof, provided that the total principal amount of bonds, including refunding bonds, outstanding at any time shall not exceed $200 million, excluding from such limit any revenue bonds.\n\nAll of the bonds of one or more series of the bonds of the Authority at any time outstanding may be refunded by the Authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the Authority may deem necessary, but not exceeding an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with all unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and with any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as determined by the Authority. The proceeds of any such refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the Authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof, and may, pending such application, be placed in trust in accordance with the provisions of § 62.1-143 of this chapter to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the Authority. All refunding bonds may have all of the attributes of revenue bonds to the extent that such other provisions of this chapter relating to revenue bonds may be applicable to refunding bonds.\n\nC. The principal of and the interest on all bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the prevailing rate of interest at the time, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth.\n\nAll bonds shall be signed by the Executive Director of the Authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary of the Authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Executive Director of the Authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.\n\nThe proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction and control of port facilities or the portion thereof for which such bonds shall have been issued, or, in the case of refunding bonds, to refund such bonds including any unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as shall be determined by the Authority upon the issuance of such refunding bonds, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or, if such bonds shall have been issued for paying the cost of a portion of the project, such surplus may be applied to the payment of the cost of any remaining portion of the project.\n\nPrior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.\n\nThe Authority shall not issue any bonds, other than revenue bonds or any refunding bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the second paragraph of subsection B of § 62.1-140, which are not specifically authorized by a bill or resolution passed by a majority vote of those elected to each house of the General Assembly. Refunding bonds may only be issued with the consent of the Governor. However, the Governor, in his sole discretion, may approve bonds which have not been authorized by the General Assembly if such bonds are to finance capital projects that emerge between legislative sessions, provided the debt is required to stimulate commerce consistent with § 62.1-132.3 and provided that:\n\n1. The total amount of such bonds added to the total amount of Virginia Port Authority bonds currently authorized does not exceed the limit in § 62.1-140 B;\n\n2. Funds are available within the appropriations, if needed, without adverse effect on other projects or programs, or from unappropriated nongeneral fund revenues or balances;\n\n3. In the Governor's opinion such action may result in a measurable benefit to the Commonwealth;\n\n4. The authorization includes a detailed description of the project, the project need, the total project costs, the estimated operating costs, and the fund sources for the project and its operating costs;\n\n5. The requirements of Chapter 11.1 (§ 10.1-1182 et seq.), Title 10.1, regarding environmental impact statements, will be met as a precondition for the approval of the project; and\n\n6.
