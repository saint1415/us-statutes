The court may determine the same, and may, in its discretion, grant such privilege and fix such rates and charges upon such conditions and limitations as to it may seem fit. The court, at any subsequent term, may, if it think proper, revoke such privilege, or alter such conditions or limitations, or regulate the rates and charges. This section shall not be construed to authorize a circuit court of the county to grant the privilege of erecting a wharf within a city.\n\nCode 1950, § 62-140; 1968, c. 659.",
