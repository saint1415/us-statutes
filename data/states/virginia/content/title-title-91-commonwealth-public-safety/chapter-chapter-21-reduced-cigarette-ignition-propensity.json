      "text": "A. Except as provided in subsection N, no cigarettes may be sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth or offered for sale or sold to persons located in the Commonwealth unless:\n\n1. The cigarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and meet the performance standard specified in this section;\n\n2. The manufacturer has filed a written certification in accordance with § 9.1-211; and\n\n3. The cigarettes have been marked in accordance with § 9.1-212.\n\nB. The performance standard for cigarettes sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth is stated in subdivision E 1.\n\nC. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E2187-04 \"Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.\" The Director, in consultation with the State Fire Marshal, may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes on a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM standard E2187-04 and the performance standard of this section.\n\nD. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper.\n\nE. 1. No more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial shall exhibit full-length burns.\n\n2. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested.\n\nF. The performance standard required by this section shall only be applied to a complete test trial.\n\nG. Written certifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to Standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization or other comparable accreditation standard required by the Director.\n\nH. Each laboratory that conducts tests in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure to determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19.\n\nI. Each cigarette listed in a certification that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard of this section shall have at least two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For a cigarette on which the bands are positioned by design, at least two bands shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column. For an unfiltered cigarette, the two complete bands shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column.\n\nJ. If the Director determines that a cigarette cannot be tested in accordance with the test method required by this section, the manufacturer of the cigarette shall propose to the Director a test method and performance standard for that cigarette. The Director, in consultation with the State Fire Marshal, may approve a test method and performance standard that the Director determines is equivalent to the requirements of this section, and the manufacturer may use that test method and performance standard for certification in accordance with § 9.1-211. If the Director determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this chapter, and the Director finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards of that state's law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, then the Director shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in the Commonwealth, unless the Director demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under this chapter. All other applicable requirements of this section shall apply to the manufacturer.\n\nK. This section does not require additional testing for cigarettes that are tested in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section for any other purpose.\n\nL. Each manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for a period of three years, and shall make copies of these reports available to the Director, State Fire Marshal, and Attorney General on written request. Any manufacturer who fails to make copies of these reports available within 60 days of receiving a written request shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day after the sixtieth day that the manufacturer does not make such copies available.\n\nM. Testing performed or sponsored by the Director to determine a cigarette's compliance with the performance standard required by this section shall be conducted in accordance with this section.\n\nN. The requirements of subsection A shall not prohibit the sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"consumer testing\" means an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by a manufacturer, or under the control and direction of a manufacturer, for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of such cigarettes, utilizing only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for such assessment.\n\n2014, cc. 370, 418.",

The flavor, if applicable;\n\n6. Whether filter or nonfilter;\n\n7. A package description, such as soft pack or box;\n\n8. The mark approved in accordance with § 9.1-212;\n\n9. The name, address, and telephone number of the laboratory, if different than the manufacturer that conducted the test; and\n\n10. The date that the testing occurred.\n\nC. On request, the certification shall be made available to the Attorney General, the Director, and the State Fire Marshal.\n\nD. Each cigarette certified under this section shall be recertified every three years.\n\nE. If a manufacturer has certified a cigarette pursuant to this section, and thereafter makes any change to such cigarette that is likely to alter its compliance with the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards mandated by this chapter, then before such cigarette may be sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth such manufacturer shall retest such cigarette in accordance with the testing standards prescribed in § 9.1-210 and maintain records of such retesting as required by § 9.1-210. Any such altered cigarette that does not meet the performance standard set forth in § 9.1-210 shall not be sold in the Commonwealth.\n\nF. For each brand style of cigarette listed in a certification, a manufacturer shall pay a fee in the amount of $250; however, the Director in consultation with the State Fire Marshal is authorized to adjust the amount of the fee annually to ensure that the amount collected therefrom defrays the actual costs of the processing, testing, enforcement, and oversight activities required by this chapter. The fees assessed under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury and shall be deposited into a special fund designated \"Cigarette Fire Safety Standard and Firefighter Protection Act Fund.\" Moneys deposited into the special fund and the unexpended balance thereof shall be appropriated to the Department of Fire Programs for use by the Director to conduct the processing, testing, enforcement, and oversight activities required by this chapter and performed by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to § 9.1-206 in carrying out the provisions of the Statewide Fire Prevention Code Act (§ 27-94 et seq.), and such expenditures from the special fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Director.\n\n2014, cc. 370, 418.",
