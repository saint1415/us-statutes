Any moneys remaining in the Fund at the end of a biennium shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Interest and income earned from the investment of such moneys shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it. The moneys in the Fund shall be (i) deemed separate and independent trust funds, (ii) segregated and accounted for separately from all other funds of the Commonwealth, and (iii) administered solely in the interests of the persons who are covered under the benefits provided pursuant to this chapter. Deposits to and assets of the Fund shall not be subject to the claims of creditors.\n\nB. The Virginia Retirement System shall invest, reinvest, and manage the assets of the Fund as provided in § 51.1-124.39 and shall be reimbursed from the Fund for such activities as provided in that section.\n\nC. The Fund shall be used to provide the benefits under this chapter related to disabled persons, deceased persons, eligible dependents, and eligible spouses on behalf of participating employers, contributing nonprofit private institutions of higher education, and contributing private police departments and to pay related administrative costs.\n\nD. Each participating employer, contributing nonprofit private institution of higher education, and contributing private police department shall make annual contributions to the Fund and provide information as determined by VRS. The amount of the contribution for each participating employer, contributing nonprofit private institution of higher education, and contributing private police department shall be determined on a current disbursement basis in accordance with the provisions of this section. For purposes of establishing contribution amounts for participating employers, a member of any fire company or department or rescue squad that has been recognized by an ordinance or a resolution of the governing body of any locality of the Commonwealth as an integral part of the official safety program of such locality shall be considered part of the locality served by the company, department, or rescue squad.

In calculating the delinquent amount, VRS may impose an interest rate of one percent per month of delinquency. The State Comptroller shall forthwith transfer such delinquent amount, plus interest, from any moneys otherwise distributable to such participating employer. In the case of a contributing nonprofit private institution of higher education or a contributing private police department, VRS may employ reasonable methods to collect the delinquent amount, including the procedures set forth in the Virginia Debt Collection Act (§ 2.2-4800 et seq.).\n\n2016, c. 677; 2017, c. 439; 2025, cc. 204, 219.",

If any disabled person or eligible spouse is receiving the benefits described in this section and would otherwise qualify for the health insurance credit described in Chapter 14 (§ 51.1-1400 et seq.) of Title 51.1, the amount of such credit shall be deposited into the Line of Duty Death and Health Benefits Trust Fund or paid to the nonparticipating employer, as applicable, from the health insurance credit trust fund, in a manner prescribed by VRS.\n\nB. 1. The continued health insurance coverage provided by this section for all disabled persons, eligible spouses, and eligible dependents shall be through separate plans, referred to as the LODA Health Benefits Plans (the Plans), administered by the Department of Human Resource Management. The Plans shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and shall be modeled upon state employee health benefits program plans. Funding of the Plans' reserves and contingency shall be provided through a line of credit, the amount of which shall be based on an actuarially determined estimate of liabilities.

Coverage in the LODA Health Benefits Plans shall also cease for any person upon his death.\n\n2. The provisions of subdivision 1 a shall not apply to any disabled person who is eligible for Medicare due to disability under Social Security Disability Insurance or a Railroad Retirement Board Disability Annuity. The Department of Human Resource Management may provide such disabled person coverage under a LODA Health Benefits Plan that is separate from the plan for other persons.\n\n3. Continued health insurance under this section shall also terminate upon the disabled person's return to full duty in any position listed in the definition of deceased person in § 9.1-400. Such disabled person shall promptly notify the participating or nonparticipating employer, the contributing nonprofit private institution of higher education, or the contributing private police department and VRS and the Department of Human Resource Management upon his return to work.\n\n4.

If a disabled person refuses to submit to the determination renewal process described in this subdivision, then benefits under this chapter shall cease for the individual, any eligible dependents, and an eligible spouse until the individual complies. If such individual does not comply within six months from the date of the initial request for a renewed determination, then benefits under this chapter shall permanently cease for the individual, any eligible dependents, and an eligible spouse. If VRS issues a renewed determination that an individual is no longer a disabled person, then benefits under this chapter shall permanently cease for the individual, any eligible dependents, and an eligible spouse. If VRS issues a renewed determination that an individual remains a disabled person, then VRS may require the disabled person to renew the determination five years after such renewed determination through a process established by VRS. The Virginia Retirement System may require the disabled person to renew the determination at any time if VRS has information indicating that the person may no longer be disabled.\n\n3. For any medical review conducted for the purpose of making an eligibility determination pursuant to this section, VRS shall require such review to be conducted by a licensed health practitioner. For purposes of this section, \"licensed health practitioner\" means a person licensed to practice medicine or osteopathic medicine pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 29 (§ 54.1-2900 et seq.) of Title 54.1, a person licensed to practice nursing pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 30 (§ 54.1-3000 et seq.) of Title 54.1, or a person licensed to practice psychology pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 36 (§ 54.1-3600 et seq.) of Title 54.1. \"Licensed health practitioner\" includes a person issued a comparable license, as determined by VRS, by the District of Columbia or a state that is contiguous to the Commonwealth.\n\nB. The Virginia Retirement System shall be reimbursed for all reasonable costs incurred and associated, directly and indirectly, in performing the duties pursuant to this chapter (i) from the Line of Duty Death and Health Benefits Trust Fund for costs related to disabled persons, deceased persons, eligible dependents, and eligible spouses on behalf of participating employers, contributing nonprofit private institutions of higher education, and contributing private police departments and (ii) from a nonparticipating employer for premiums and costs related to disabled persons, deceased persons, eligible dependents, and eligible spouses for which the nonparticipating employer is responsible.\n\nC. The Virginia Retirement System may develop policies and procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\n\n1995, cc. 156, 597, § 2.1-133.9; 1998, c. 712; 2001, c. 844; 2016, c. 677; 2017, c. 439; 2022, c. 484; 2025, cc. 204, 219.",
