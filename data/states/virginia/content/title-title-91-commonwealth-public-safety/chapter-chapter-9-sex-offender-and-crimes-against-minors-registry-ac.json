In making its determination, the court shall consider all of the following factors that are relevant to the case: (i) the degree to which the delinquent act was committed with the use of force, threat, or intimidation, (ii) the age and maturity of the complaining witness, (iii) the age and maturity of the offender, (iv) the difference in the ages of the complaining witness and the offender, (v) the nature of the relationship between the complaining witness and the offender, (vi) the offender's prior criminal history, and (vii) any other aggravating or mitigating factors relevant to the case.

If the court grants the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, his case shall be heard by another judge, unless the parties agree otherwise. Failure to make such determination or so advise the defendant does not otherwise invalidate the underlying conviction.\n\n2003, cc. 584, 732; 2004, cc. 414, 444; 2005, cc. 586, 603, 631; 2006, cc. 857, 875, 914, 931; 2007, cc. 463, 718, 759, 823; 2008, cc. 592, 747, 772, 877; 2010, c. 858; 2012, c. 243; 2013, cc. 750, 781; 2014, cc. 546, 649, 706; 2015, cc. 690, 691; 2016, c. 586; 2019, c. 617; 2020, cc. 389, 826, 829; 2021, Sp.

After five years from the date of his last conviction for a violation of § 18.2-472.1, a Tier III offender or murderer may petition for relief from the requirement to verify his registration information every month. A person who is required to register may similarly petition the circuit court for relief from the requirement to verify his registration twice each year after five years from the date of his last conviction for a violation of § 18.2-472.1. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition, on notice to the attorney for the Commonwealth, to determine whether the person suffers from a mental abnormality or a personality disorder that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of others or significantly impairs his ability to control his sexual behavior. Prior to the hearing the court shall order a comprehensive assessment of the applicant by a panel of three certified sex offender treatment providers as defined in § 54.1-3600. A report of the assessment shall be filed with the court prior to the hearing. The costs of the assessment shall be taxed as costs of the proceeding.\n\nIf, after consideration of the report and such other evidence as may be presented at the hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person does not suffer from a mental abnormality or a personality disorder that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of others or significantly impairs his ability to control his sexual behavior, the petition shall be granted and the duty to verify his registration information more frequently than once a year shall be terminated. The court shall promptly notify the State Police upon entry of an order granting the petition. The person shall, however, be under a continuing duty to register annually for life. If the petition is denied, the duty to verify his registration information with the same frequency as before shall continue. A denial of a petition shall be appealable pursuant to § 17.1-405.\n\nA petition for relief pursuant to this subsection may not be filed within three years from the date on which any previous petition for such relief was denied.\n\nB.

The court shall hold a hearing on the petition, on notice to the attorney for the Commonwealth, to determine whether the person suffers from a physical condition that makes the person (i) no longer a menace to the health and safety of others and (ii) incapable of reregistering or verifying his registration information. Prior to the hearing the court shall order a comprehensive assessment of the applicant by at least two licensed physicians other than the person's primary care physician. A report of the assessment shall be filed with the court prior to the hearing. The costs of the assessment shall be taxed as costs of the proceeding.\n\nIf, after consideration of the report and such other evidence as may be presented at the hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that due to his physical condition the person (i) no longer poses a menace to the health and safety of others and (ii) is incapable of reregistering or verifying his registration information, the petition shall be granted and the duty to reregister or verify his registration information shall be terminated.

An appeal from the denial of a petition shall be to the Court of Appeals.\n\nA petition for relief pursuant to this subsection may not be filed within three years from the date on which any previous petition for such relief was denied.\n\nIf, at any time, the person's physical condition changes so that he is capable of reoffending, reregistering, or verifying his registration information, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall file a petition with the circuit court in the jurisdiction where the person resides and the court shall hold a hearing on the petition, with notice to the person and his guardian, to determine whether the person still suffers from a physical condition that makes the person (i) no longer a menace to the health and safety of others and (ii) incapable of reregistering or verifying his registration information. If the petition is granted, the duty to reregister shall commence from the date of the court's order. An appeal from the denial or granting of a petition shall be to the Court of Appeals.

The Superintendent of State Police shall establish a Supplement to the Registry of information composed of persons who were convicted of an offense listed in subsection B on or after July 1, 1980, and before July 1, 1994, but whose names are not on the Registry. Access to the Supplement to the Registry shall be made available to the public on the website of the Department of State Police and shall contain the following information for each person: name, year of birth, the date of the conviction, the jurisdiction in which the conviction occurred, the person's age on the date of the conviction, the offense of which he was convicted, and the Code of Virginia section of the conviction.\n\nB. Information on the following offenses where the conviction occurred on or after July 1, 1980, and before July 1, 1994, shall be listed in the Supplement: clause (i) of § 18.2-48 if the victim was a minor; clauses (ii) and (iii) of § 18.2-48; § 18.2-61; § 18.2-63 if the victim was under 13 years of age; subsection A of § 18.2-63 if the offender was more than five years older than the victim; §§ 18.2-67.1, 18.2-67.2, and 18.2-67.3; § 18.2-67.4 if the victim was a minor; subsections A and B of § 18.2-67.5; subsection C of § 18.2-67.5 if the victim was a minor; § 18.2-361 if the victim was a minor; and §§ 18.2-370, 18.2-370.1, and 18.2-374.1.\n\nC. Persons whose names and conviction information appear on the Supplement are not subject to the registration requirements of this chapter and are not considered persons for whom registration is required unless they are required to register pursuant to other provisions of this chapter.\n\nD. A person whose name and conviction information appear on the Supplement may, regardless of the date of conviction, petition the circuit court in which he was convicted or the circuit court where he then resides for removal of his name and conviction information from the Supplement if the offense he was convicted of would qualify for removal from the Registry under § 9.1-910. A petition may not be filed until all court ordered treatment, counseling, and restitution has been completed. The court shall obtain a copy of the petitioner's complete criminal history and then hold a hearing on the petition at which the applicant and any interested persons may present witnesses and other evidence. The Commonwealth shall be made a party to any action under this subsection. If after such a hearing, the court is satisfied that such person does not pose a risk to public safety, the court shall grant the petition. In the event the petition is not granted, the person shall wait at least 24 months from the date of denial to file a new petition for removal from the Supplement. The State Police shall remove from the Supplement the name and conviction information upon receipt of an order granting a petition pursuant to this subsection.\n\nE. The Superintendent of State Police shall complete the Supplement to the Registry prior to January 1, 2016.\n\n2015, cc. 594, 603.",
