Assess a minimum of $5,000 for the sixth violation, and for each ensuing violation, without limitation;\n\n11. Waive the initial $200 minimum assessment if the Commissioner finds that the violation of the commercial feed variance provision has not occurred within the 90-day period; and\n\n12. Have the discretion not to make an assessment if the value of the deficiency of the initial violation is $5 or less, but shall notify the manufacturer or guarantor and shall apply all further assessments on additional violations.\n\nD. The manufacturer or guarantor shall pay all assessments to the Commissioner within 60 days of notice of payment due. Any person who fails to pay the assessment within the specified time shall pay to the Commissioner a late fee as specified in § 3.2-4811. The Commissioner shall revoke the license of such person who fails to pay the assessment.\n\nE. The Commissioner shall compute the approximate value per pound of protein and fat and this computation shall be used to establish the relative value of deficiencies on commercial feed sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth. The Commissioner may furnish, and upon application shall furnish, such relative values to any person engaged in the manufacture or sale of feed in the Commonwealth.\n\nF. As used in this section, the term \"value of the deficiency\" means the monetary value of the deficiency in protein or fat of the lot of commercial feed from which the Commissioner collected a sample. The Commissioner shall determine the value of the deficiency by calculating the number of pounds of commercial feed deficient in protein or fat, as compared to the label guarantee, in the sample lot and multiplying those pounds by the relative value per pound of protein or fat.\n\n1994, c. 743, § 3.1-828.11; 2008, c. 860.",
