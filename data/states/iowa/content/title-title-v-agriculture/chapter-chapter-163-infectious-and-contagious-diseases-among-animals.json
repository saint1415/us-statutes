As part of the seizure of an abandoned animal, the department may take, impound, and retain custody of the animal, including by maintaining the animal in a manner and at a location determined by the department to be reasonable under the emergency circumstances. The department may take action as provided in this subtitle to ensure that all animals exposed to an infectious or contagious disease are properly identified, tested, segregated, treated, or destroyed as provided in this subtitle.\n\n5. a. The department may seize an animal if the department has a reasonable suspicion the animal has been abandoned, including by entering onto public or private property or into a private motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer parked on public or private property, as provided in this subsection.\n\nb.

The court may grant a continuance by a motion of the department or upon petition by an interested person. However, the interested person shall post a bond or other security with the department in an amount determined by the court, which shall not be more than the amount sufficient to provide for the maintenance of the animal for the duration of the continuance.\n\n2. Upon a determination by the department that exigent circumstances exist, the dispositional proceeding may be conducted by an administrative law judge in the same manner as an emergency adjudicative proceeding pursuant to section 17A.18A. The administrative law judge shall notify the department and all interested persons of the dispositional proceeding in a manner determined reasonable by the administrative law judge given the circumstances in the case. The procedures provided in this section may be supplemented or modified by a declaration or proclamation issued by the governor or an order issued by the secretary or the secretary’s designee pursuant to section 163.3D.\n\n3. a. A court or administrative law judge shall issue an order for the disposition of the animal after making any of the following determinations:\n\n(1) That no interested person holds a legal interest in the seized animal. In that case, the animal shall be deemed abandoned and the order shall extinguish all prior legal interests in the animal. The order shall grant an undivided ownership interest in the animal free from any security interest or other agricultural lien or encumbrance to the department.\n\n(2) That an interested person holds a legal interest in the seized animal, and the department has reasonable suspicion to believe that the animal has been exposed to an infectious or contagious disease. In that case, the order shall provide for the disposition of the animal in the same manner as if the department had identified the animal as having been exposed to the infectious or contagious disease under the authorization provided in section 163.3D.\n\n(3) That a person holds a legal interest in the seized animal, and there is no reasonable suspicion that the seized animal has been exposed to an infectious or contagious disease. In that case, the order shall direct the department to transfer custody of the animal to the interested person. In the event the animal is returned to the interested person, the department shall not be subject to any claim for damages caused by the seizure if the department’s actions were taken pursuant to the department’s emergency efforts to establish and maintain quarantine in response to a disease outbreak, as set forth in section 669.14, subsection 3.\n\nb. A reasonable suspicion asserted by the department may be based on any credible evidence that shows the animal’s possible exposure to an infectious or contagious disease or the animal was abandoned. This paragraph “b” does not require the department to conduct a test of an animal to determine whether an animal has been exposed.\n\nc. If two or more interested parties may be transferred custody of an animal by the department pursuant to paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), the court or administrative law judge shall order the department to transfer the animal to the owner or otherwise to the interested person best able to care for the animal without prejudicing the rights of any other interested person. However, in any cause of action brought by an interested person contesting the order to transfer under this subsection, the department shall not be included as a party.\n\n4. a. In a dispositional proceeding conducted by a court or administrative law judge under this section, or in a separate cause of action brought by the department against an interested person, the court or administrative law judge may award the department all of the following:\n\n(1) An amount necessary to reimburse the department for expenses incurred in seizing and maintaining an abandoned animal as well as any costs for the disposition of the abandoned animal.\n\n(2) Expenses related to the investigation and adjudication of the case.\n\nb. In a dispositional proceeding conducted by a court under this section, or in a separate cause of action brought by the department against an interested person, the court may award the department court costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n\nc. An award ordered under this subsection shall be paid by an interested party who is transferred a seized animal by the court or administrative law judge, or the owner of the seized animal as determined by the court or administrative law judge. The amount awarded the department shall be subtracted from the proceeds, if any, received by the department from the disposition of the animal. Any amount awarded by a court shall be taxed as part of the costs of the cause of action.\n\nd. If more than one interested person holds a legal interest in the animal, the court or administrative law judge shall calculate the respective contributions of the interested persons based upon the percentage of legal interest in the seized animal held by each interested person. The amount paid to the department shall be sufficient to allow the department to repay the livestock remediation fund as provided in section 459.501 and fully reimburse the department for all costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the department under this section.\n\n2020 Acts, ch 1036, §8, 16\n\nReferred to in §163.3D, 163.3F, 459.501",

The program of eradication shall provide for the indemnification of owners of the livestock under this section, if there are no other sources of indemnification. The program shall not be effective until the program has been approved by the executive council.\n\n2. If an animal afflicted with the infectious or contagious disease tuberculosis is destroyed under a program of eradication as provided in this section, the owner shall be compensated according to one of the following methods:\n\na. (1) A determination of an indemnity amount as agreed to by appraisal. The determination shall be made by appraisers who shall be three competent and disinterested persons, including one who is appointed by the department, one who is appointed by the owner, and one who is appointed by agreement of the department and the owner. The appraisers shall report their appraisal under oath to the department.

For registered purebred stock, the indemnity amount may exceed market prices by not more than fifty percent. The indemnity amount shall be less any amount of indemnification that the owner might be allowed from the United States department of agriculture. An indemnity shall not be allowed for an animal if the department of agriculture and land stewardship determines that the animal has been fed raw garbage as provided in section 163.26.\n\n(3) A claim for an indemnity by the owner and a claim for compensation and expenses by the appraisers shall be filed with the department and submitted by the secretary of agriculture to the executive council for authorization of payment of the claim as an expense from the appropriations addressed in section 7D.29.\n\nb. A formula established by rule adopted by the department that is effective as determined by the department in accordance with chapter 17A and applicable upon approval of the program of eradication by the executive council. The formula shall be applicable to indemnify owners if the executive council, upon recommendation by the secretary of agriculture, determines that an animal population in this state is threatened with infection from an exceptionally contagious form of the disease tuberculosis.\n\n(1) An owner shall be paid an indemnity amount based on the formula, only if the owner elects to be paid under the formula in lieu of the determination by appointed appraisers as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(2) The formula shall provide for the payment of the fair market value of an animal based on market prices paid for similar animals according to categories or criteria established by the department, which may include payment based on the species, breed, type, weight, sex, age, purebred status, and condition of the animal. The department may provide for deductions based on other compensation received by the owner for the destruction of the animals. The department may exclude a claim if the person would be ineligible to receive compensation by three appointed appraisers as provided in this section.\n\n(3) If an owner elects to be paid an indemnity amount based on a method that provides either a determination by appointed appraisers or pursuant to a formula, the owner shall not be entitled to revoke the election, unless otherwise provided by the department. An owner’s decision to delay or refuse to make an election under this section shall not affect the condemnation and destruction of afflicted animals under the program of eradication.\n\n(4) The executive council may authorize payment under the provisions of this paragraph “b” as an expense from the appropriations addressed in section 7D.29.\n\n[SS15, §2538-1a – 8a; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §2657; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §163.15]\n\n2002 Acts, ch 1101, §1; 2004 Acts, ch 1163, §7, 8; 2011 Acts, ch 131, §29 – 32, 158; 2015 Acts, ch 133, §3 – 6\n\nReferred to in §163.10, 163.16, 163.51",

      "text": "163.30 Swine movement — definitions — dealer licenses, permits, and fees.\n\n1. This section shall apply to all swine moved interstate and intrastate, except swine moved directly to slaughter or to a livestock market for sale directly to a slaughtering establishment for immediate slaughter.\n\n2. When used in this subchapter:\n\na. “Dealer” means any person who is engaged in the business of buying for resale, or selling, or exchanging swine as a principal or agent or who claims to be so engaged, but does not include the owner or operator of a farm who does not claim to be so engaged and who sells or exchanges only those swine which have been kept by the person solely for feeding or breeding purposes.\n\nb. “Move” or “movement” means to ship, transport, or deliver swine by land, water, or air, except that “move” or “movement” does not mean a relocation.\n\nc. “Relocate” or “relocation” means to ship, transport, or deliver swine by land, water, or air, to different premises, if the ownership of the swine does not change, the prior and new premises are located within the state, and the shipment, transportation, or delivery between the prior and new premises occurs within the state.\n\nd. “Separate and apart” means a manner of holding swine so as not to have physical contact with other swine on the premises.\n\n3. A person shall not act as a dealer unless the department issues the person a dealer’s license. The person must be licensed as a dealer regardless of whether the swine originate in this state or another jurisdiction or the person resides in this state or another jurisdiction. The jurisdiction may be in another state or a foreign nation.\n\na. The fee for a dealer’s license is ten dollars. A dealer’s license expires on the first day of the second July following the date of issue. An initial license shall be numbered and any subsequent or renewed license issued to that dealer shall retain the same license number.\n\nb. To be issued a license, an applicant must file a surety bond with the department. The applicant shall file a standard surety bond of ten thousand dollars with the secretary named as trustee, for the use and benefit of anyone damaged by a violation of this section, except that the bond shall not be required for dealers who are bonded in the same or a greater amount than required pursuant to the federal Packers and Stockyards Act. In addition, the department may require that a licensee file evidence of financial responsibility with the department prior to a license being issued or renewed as provided in section 202C.2.\n\nc. Each employee or agent doing business by buying for resale, selling, or exchanging feeder swine in the name of a licensed dealer must obtain a permit issued by the department showing the person is employed by or represents a licensed dealer. A permit shall be issued upon the department’s approval of a completed application. An application form shall be furnished by the department. The fee for a permit is six dollars. A permit shall expire on the first day of the second July following the date of issue.\n\nd. A permittee shall not represent more than one dealer. Failure of a licensee or permittee to comply with this chapter or a rule made pursuant to this chapter is cause for revocation by the secretary of the permit or license after notice to the alleged offender and the holding of a hearing by the secretary. Rules shall be made in accordance with chapter 17A. A rule, the violation of which is made the basis for revocation, except temporary emergency rules, shall first have been approved after public hearing as provided in section 17A.4 after giving twenty days’ notice of the hearing by mailing the notice, by ordinary mail, to every person filing a request for notice accompanied by an addressed envelope with prepaid postage. Any person may file such a request to be listed with any agency for notice for the time and place for all hearings on proposed rules, which request shall be accompanied by a remittance of five dollars. Such fee shall be added to the operating fund of the department. The listing shall expire semiannually on January 1 and July 1.\n\n4. a. All swine moved shall be individually identified with a distinctive and easily discernible ear tag affixed in either ear of the animal or other identification acceptable to the department, which has been specified by rule promulgated under the department’s rulemaking authority. The department shall make ear tags available at convenient locations within each county and shall sell such tags at a price not exceeding the cost to producers and others to comply with this section.\n\nb. Every seller, dealer and market operator shall keep a record of the ear tag numbers, or other approved identification, and the farm of origin of swine moved by or through that person, which records shall be made available by that person to any appropriate representative of the department or the United States department of agriculture.\n\n5. All swine moved shall be accompanied by a certificate of veterinary inspection issued by the state of origin and prepared and signed by a veterinarian. The certificate shall show the point of origin, the point of destination, individual identification, immunization status, and, when required, any movement permit number assigned to the shipment by the department. All such movement of swine shall be completed within seventy-two hours unless an extension of time for movement is granted by the department.\n\na. However, swine may be moved intrastate directly to an approved state, federal, or auction market without identification or certification, if the swine are to be identified and certificated at the state, federal, or auction market.\n\nb. Registered swine for exhibition or breeding purposes which can be individually identified by a method approved by the department are excepted from the identification requirement.\n\nc. Native Iowa swine moved from farm to farm shall be excepted from the identification requirement if the owner transferring possession of the feeder pigs executes a written agreement with the person taking possession of the feeder pigs. The agreement shall provide that the feeder pigs shall not be commingled with other swine for a period of thirty days. The owner transferring possession shall be responsible for making certain that the agreement is executed and for providing a copy of the agreement to the person taking possession.\n\n6. The department may combine a certificate of veterinary inspection with a certificate of inspection required under chapter 166D.\n\n7. The department may require issuance of movement permits on certain categories of swine moved, prior to their movement, pursuant to rules adopted by the department. The rules shall be adopted when in the judgment of the secretary, such movement would otherwise threaten or imperil the eradication of classical swine fever in Iowa.\n\n8. All swine moved shall be quarantined separate and apart from other swine located at the Iowa farm of destination for thirty days beginning with their arrival at such premises, or if such incoming swine are not held separate and apart, all swine on such premises shall be thus quarantined, except animals moving from such premises directly to slaughter.\n\n9. There can only be one transfer by a dealer, involving not more than two markets, prior to quarantine.\n\n10. The use of anti-classical swine fever serum or antibody concentrate shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the department.\n\n11. Any swine found by a registered veterinarian to have any infectious or contagious disease after delivery to a livestock sale barn or auction market for resale, other than for slaughter, shall be immediately returned to the consignor’s premises to be quarantined separate and apart for fifteen days. Such swine shall not be moved from such premises for any purpose unless a certificate of veterinary inspection accompanies the swine’s movement or unless the swine are sent to slaughter.\n\n[C62, 66, §163.30; C71, §163.30 – 163.33; C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §163.30]\n\n87 Acts, ch 115, §28; 91 Acts, ch 32, §2\n\n; 97 Acts, ch 183, §1, 13\n\n; 98 Acts, ch 1056, §2; 2003 Acts, ch 90, §1; 2003 Acts, ch 108, §41; 2004 Acts, ch 1101, §27; 2004 Acts, ch 1163, §11, 12; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §203, 204; 2010 Acts, ch 1069, §21; 2011 Acts, ch 34, §37; 2011 Acts, ch 46, §7; 2012 Acts, ch 1095, §24, 35; 2017 Acts, ch 159, §18, 19, 56\n\nReferred to in §163.61, 166D.2, 166D.10, 202C.1, 202C.2",
