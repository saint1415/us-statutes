The board of veterinary medicine, after due notice and hearing, may revoke or suspend a license to practice veterinary medicine if it determines that a veterinarian licensed to practice veterinary medicine is guilty of any of the following acts or offenses:\n\na. Knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representation in the practice of the profession.\n\nb. Being convicted of a felony in the courts of this state or another state, territory, or country. Conviction as used in this paragraph includes a conviction of an offense which if committed in this state would be deemed a felony without regard to its designation elsewhere, or a criminal proceeding in which a finding or verdict of guilt is made or returned, but the adjudication or guilt is either withheld or not entered. A certified copy of the final order or judgment of conviction or plea of guilty in this state or in another state is conclusive evidence.\n\nc. Violating a statute or law of this state, another state, or the United States, without regard to its designation as either felony or misdemeanor, which statute or law relates to the practice of veterinary medicine.\n\nd. Having the person’s license to practice veterinary medicine revoked or suspended, or having other disciplinary action taken by a licensing authority of another state, territory, or country. A certified copy of the record or order of suspension, revocation, or disciplinary action is conclusive or prima facie evidence.\n\ne. Knowingly aiding, assisting, procuring, or advising a person to unlawfully practice veterinary medicine.\n\nf. Being adjudged mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction. The adjudication shall automatically suspend a license for the duration of the license unless the board orders otherwise.\n\ng. Being guilty of a willful or repeated departure from, or the failure to conform to, the minimal standard of acceptable and prevailing practice of veterinary medicine as defined in rules adopted by the board, in which proceeding actual injury to an animal need not be established; or the committing by a veterinarian of an act contrary to honesty, justice, or good morals, whether the act is committed in the course of the practice or otherwise, and whether committed within or without this state.\n\nh. Inability to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill and safety by reason of illness, drunkenness, excessive use of drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or other type of material or as a result of a mental or physical condition.\n\ni. Willful or repeated violation of lawful rules adopted by the board or violation of a lawful order of the board, previously entered by the board in a disciplinary hearing.\n\n2. a. The board, upon probable cause, may compel a veterinarian to submit to a mental or physical examination by designated physicians. Failure of a veterinarian to submit to an examination constitutes an admission to the allegations made against that veterinarian and the finding of fact and decision of the board may be entered without the taking of testimony or presentation of evidence. At reasonable intervals, a veterinarian shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that the veterinarian can resume the competent practice of veterinary medicine with reasonable skill and safety to animals.\n\nb. A person licensed to practice veterinary medicine who makes application for the renewal of the person’s license as required by section 169.12 gives consent to submit to a mental or physical examination as provided by this paragraph when directed in writing by the board. All objections shall be waived as to the admissibility of the examining physician’s testimony or examination reports on the grounds that they constitute privileged communication. The medical testimony or examination reports shall not be used against a veterinarian in another proceeding and are confidential except for other actions filed against a veterinarian to revoke or suspend that person’s license.\n\n[S13, §2538-e; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §2799; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, §169.36; C79, 81, §169.13]\n\n83 Acts, ch 115, §8; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §64\n\nReferred to in §169.14, 272C.3, 272C.4",

The board, upon its own motion or upon a verified complaint in writing, may request the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing to conduct an investigation of the charges contained in the complaint. The department of inspections, appeals, and licensing shall report its findings to the board, and the board may issue an order fixing the time and place for hearing if a hearing is deemed warranted. A written notice of the time and place of the hearing, together with a statement of the charges, shall be served upon the licensee at least ten days before the hearing in the manner required for the service of notice of the commencement of an ordinary action.\n\n2. If the licensee has left the state, the notice and statement of the charges shall be so served at least twenty days before the date of the hearing, wherever the licensee may be found. If the whereabouts of the licensee is unknown, service may be had by publication as provided in the rules of civil procedure upon filing the affidavit required by those rules. If the licensee fails to appear either in person or by counsel at the time and place designated in the notice, the board shall proceed with the hearing.\n\n3. The hearing shall be before a member or members designated by the board or before an administrative law judge appointed by the board according to the requirements of section 17A.11, subsection 1. The presiding board member or administrative law judge may issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and take or cause depositions to be taken in connection with the hearing. The member or officer shall issue subpoenas at the request and on behalf of the licensee.\n\n4. A mechanized or stenographic record of the proceedings shall be kept. The licensee shall be given the opportunity to appear personally and by attorney, with the right to produce evidence in one’s own behalf, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to examine documentary evidence produced against the licensee.\n\n5. If a person refuses to obey a subpoena issued by the presiding member or administrative law judge or to answer a proper question put to that person during the hearing, the presiding member or administrative law judge may invoke the aid of a court of competent jurisdiction in requiring the attendance and testimony of that person and the production of papers. A failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a civil contempt may be punished.\n\n6. Unless the hearing is before the entire board, a transcript of the proceeding, together with exhibits presented, shall be considered by the entire board at the earliest practicable time. The licensee and attorney shall be given the opportunity to appear personally to present the licensee’s position and arguments to the board. The board shall determine the charge upon the merits on the basis of the evidence in the record before it.\n\n7. Upon three members of the board voting in favor of finding the licensee guilty of an act or offense specified in section 169.13, the board shall prepare written findings of fact and its decision imposing one or more of the following disciplinary measures:\n\na. Suspend the license to practice veterinary medicine for a period to be determined by the board.\n\nb. Revoke the license to practice veterinary medicine.\n\nc. Suspend imposition of judgment and penalty or impose the judgment and penalty, but suspend enforcement and place the veterinarian on probation. The probation ordered may be vacated upon noncompliance. The board may restore and reissue a license to practice veterinary medicine, and may impose a disciplinary or corrective measure which it might originally have imposed.\n\n8. Judicial review of the board’s action may be sought in accordance with chapter 17A.\n\n9. The filing of a petition for review does not in itself stay execution or enforcement of board action. Upon application, the board or the review court, in appropriate cases, may order a stay pending the outcome of the review proceedings.\n\n[C31, 35, §2799-d1, -d3, -d4, -d6; C39, §2799.1, 2799.3, 2799.4, 2799.6; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, §169.37, 169.39, 169.40, 169.42; C79, 81, §169.14]\n\n83 Acts, ch 115, §9; 88 Acts, ch 1109, §18; 88 Acts, ch 1158, §44; 89 Acts, ch 296, §19; 98 Acts, ch 1202, §33, 46; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1918\n\nReferred to in §169.5, 169.8, 169.20\n\nSubsection 1 amended",
