The commissioners, as a condition for the receipt of any state cost-sharing funds for permanent soil conservation practices, shall require the owner of the land on which the practices are to be established to covenant and file, in the office of the district of the county in which the land is located, an agreement identifying the particular lands upon which the practices for which state cost-sharing funds are to be received will be established, and providing that the project will not be removed, altered, or modified so as to lessen its effectiveness without the consent of the commissioners, obtained in advance and based on guidelines drawn up by the committee, for a period not to exceed twenty years after the date of receiving payment. The commissioners shall assist the division in the enforcement of this subsection. The agreement does not create a lien on the land, but is a charge personally against the owner of the land at the time of removal, alteration, or modification if an administrative order is made under section 161A.61, subsection 3.\n\n4.

The application shall recite that the property of the district has been disposed of and the proceeds paid over as provided in this section, and shall set forth a full accounting of the properties and proceeds of the sale. The secretary of state shall issue to the commissioners a certificate of dissolution and shall record the certificate in an appropriate book of record in the secretary of state’s office.\n\n3.

The commitment shall be conditioned on the furnishing by the soil and water conservation district of technical or planning assistance in the establishment of and cost-sharing or other financial assistance for establishment and maintenance of the soil and water conservation practices necessary to implement the plan or a portion of the plan.\n\n3. “Cost-share” or “cost-sharing” means a contribution of money made by the state in order to pay a percentage of the costs related to the establishment of voluntary or mandatory practices as provided under this chapter, including but not limited to soil and water conservation practices and erosion control practices.\n\n4. “Erosion control practices” means:\n\na. The construction or installation, and maintenance, of such structures or devices as are necessary to carry to a suitable outlet from the site of any building housing four or more residential units, any commercial or industrial development or any publicly or privately owned recreational or service facility of any kind, not served by a central storm sewer system, any water which:\n\n(1) Would otherwise cause erosion in excess of the applicable soil loss limit; and\n\n(2) Does not carry nor constitute sewage, industrial waste, or other waste as defined by section 455B.171.\n\nb. The employment of temporary devices or structures, temporary seeding, fibre mats, plastic, straw, or other measures adequate to prevent erosion in excess of the applicable soil loss limits from the site of, or land directly affected by, the construction of any public or private street, road or highway, any residential, commercial, or industrial building or development, or any publicly or privately owned recreational or service facility of any kind, at all times prior to completion of such construction.\n\nc. The establishment and maintenance of vegetation upon the right-of-way of any completed portion of any public street, road, or highway, or the construction or installation thereon of structures or devices, or other measures adequate to prevent erosion from the right-of-way in excess of the applicable soil loss limits.\n\n5. “Farm unit” means a single contiguous tract of agricultural land, or two or more adjacent tracts of agricultural land, located within a single soil and water conservation district, upon which farming operations are being conducted by a person who owns or is purchasing or renting all of the land, or by that person’s tenant or tenants. If a landowner has multiple farm tenants, the land on which farming operations are being conducted by each tenant is a separate farm unit. This definition does not prohibit land which is within a single soil and water conservation district and is owned or being purchased by the same person, or is being rented by the same tenant, from being treated as two or more farm units if the commissioners of the soil and water conservation district deem it preferable to do so.\n\n6. “Farm unit soil conservation plan” means a plan jointly developed by the owner and, if appropriate, the operator of a farm unit and the commissioners of the soil and water conservation district within which that farm unit is located, identifying those permanent soil and water conservation practices and temporary soil and water conservation practices the use of which may be expected to prevent soil loss by erosion from that farm unit in excess of the applicable soil loss limit or limits. The plan shall if practicable identify alternative practices by which this objective may be attained.\n\n7. “Forest” means stands of native or introduced trees containing at least two hundred trees per acre and located on privately owned land. However, a stand of fruit trees is not a forest.\n\n8. “Professional forester” means a forestry graduate of an institution of higher learning, who has a minimum of two years of forest management experience.\n\n9. “Soil and water conservation practices” means any of the practices designated in or pursuant to this subsection which serve to prevent erosion of soil by wind or water, in excess of applicable soil loss limits, from land used for agricultural or horticultural purposes only.\n\na. “Permanent soil and water conservation practices” means planting of perennial grasses, legumes, shrubs, or trees, the establishment of grassed waterways, and the construction of terraces, or other permanent soil and water practices approved by the committee.\n\nb. “Temporary soil and water conservation practices” means planting of annual or biennial crops, use of strip-cropping, contour planting, or minimum or mulch tillage, and any other cultural practices approved by the committee.\n\n10. “Soil loss limit” means the maximum amount of soil loss due to erosion by water or wind, expressed in terms of tons per acre per year, which the commissioners of the respective soil and water conservation districts determine is acceptable in order to meet the objectives expressed in section 161A.2.\n\n11. “State forester” means a person employed by the department of natural resources as required by section 456A.13.\n\n[C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §467A.42]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1238, §40; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §655, 656; 87 Acts, ch 23, §30; 88 Acts, ch 1134, §88; 89 Acts, ch 106, §4; 92 Acts, ch 1184, §2, 3\n\nC93, §161A.42\n\n94 Acts, ch 1107, §8; 2012 Acts, ch 1095, §11, 12; 2016 Acts, ch 1011, §121; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §59\n\nReferred to in §161A.44, 161A.71",

Establish different soil loss limits for different classes of land in the district if in their judgment and that of the committee a lower soil loss limit should be applied to some land than can reasonably be applied to other land in the district, it being the intent of the general assembly that no land in the state be assigned a soil loss limit that cannot reasonably be applied to such land.\n\n3. Require the owners of real property in the district to employ either soil and water conservation practices or erosion control practices, and:\n\na. May not specify the particular practices to be employed so long as such owners voluntarily comply with the applicable soil loss limits established for the district.\n\nb.

Except as otherwise provided by subsection 3, the assets of the conservation practices revolving loan fund shall be used only to make loans directly to owners of land in this state for the purpose of establishing on that land any new permanent soil and water conservation practice which the commissioners of the soil and water conservation district in which the land is located have found is necessary or advisable to meet the soil loss limits established for that land. A loan shall not be made for establishing a permanent soil and water conservation practice on land that is subject to the restriction on state cost-sharing funds of section 161A.76. Revolving loan funds and public cost-sharing funds may be used in combination for funding a particular soil and water conservation practice. Each loan made under this section shall be for a period not to exceed ten years, shall bear no interest, and shall be repayable to the conservation practices revolving loan fund in equal yearly installments due March 1 of each year the loan is in effect.

Applicants are eligible for no more than twenty thousand dollars in loans outstanding at any time under this program. “Permanent soil and water conservation practices” has the same meaning as defined in section 161A.42 and those established under this program are subject to the requirements of section 161A.7, subsection 3. Loans made under this program shall come due for payment upon sale of the land on which those practices are established.\n\n2. The general assembly finds and declares the following:\n\na. The erosion of topsoil on agricultural land by wind and water is a serious problem within the state and one which threatens to destroy the natural resource most responsible for Iowa’s prosperity.\n\nb. It is necessary to the preservation of the economy and well-being of the state to encourage soil conservation practices by providing loans for permanent soil and water conservation practices on agricultural land within the state.\n\nc. The use of state funds for the conservation practices revolving loan fund established under subsection 1 is in the public interest, and the purposes of this section are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted.\n\n3. The division may:\n\na. Contract, sue and be sued, and promulgate administrative rules necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, but the committee shall not in any manner directly or indirectly pledge the credit of the state of Iowa.\n\nb.

This section does not negate the provisions of section 161A.48 that an owner or occupant of land in this state shall not be required to establish any new soil and water conservation practice unless public cost-sharing funds have been approved and are available for the land affected. However, the owner of land with respect to which an administrative order to establish soil and water conservation practices has been issued under section 161A.47 but not complied with for lack of public cost-sharing funds, may waive the right to await availability of such funds and instead apply for a loan under this section to establish any permanent soil and water conservation practices necessary to comply with the order. If a landowner does so, that loan application shall be given reasonable preference by the committee if there are applications for more loans under this section than can be made from the money available in the conservation practices revolving loan fund. If it is found necessary to deny an application for a soil and water conservation practices loan to a landowner who has waived the right to availability of public cost-sharing funds before complying with an administrative order issued under section 161A.47, the landowner’s waiver is void.\n\n83 Acts, ch 207, §53, 93\n\nCS83, §467A.71\n\n85 Acts, ch 67, §46; 85 Acts, ch 170, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1244, §58; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §661; 87 Acts, ch 23, §44; 91 Acts, ch 260, §1234\n\nC93, §161A.71\n\n2013 Acts, ch 15, §1; 2017 Acts, ch 159, §14",
