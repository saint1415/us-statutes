Such reports and answers shall be made under oath, or otherwise as the secretary may prescribe, and shall be filed with the secretary within such reasonable period as the secretary may prescribe, unless additional time be granted in any case by the secretary.\n\n4. a. For the purpose of this chapter the secretary may, at all reasonable times, examine and copy any documentary evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against, and may require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all documentary evidence of any person relating to any matter under investigation. The secretary may sign subpoenas and administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.\n\nb.

The district court may, in case of failure or refusal to obey a subpoena issued under this section to any person, enter an order requiring such person to appear before the secretary or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence concerning the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as contempt.\n\nd.
