The amount of the evidence of financial responsibility shall be established by rules which shall be adopted by the department. Unless the department otherwise has good cause, the rules shall be based upon the volume of sales reported by the dealer to the United States department of agriculture grain inspection, packers and stockyards administration. However, the evidence of financial responsibility shall not be for less than five thousand dollars or for more than twenty-five thousand dollars. The department may increase the amount of the evidence of financial responsibility for a dealer upon a showing of good cause.\n\n4. The evidence of financial responsibility must be conditioned upon the dealer’s faithful performance of the terms and conditions of the sales agreement.
