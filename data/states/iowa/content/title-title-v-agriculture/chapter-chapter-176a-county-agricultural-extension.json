Upon adoption of such resolutions providing for such consolidation, the extension councils shall do all things which may be necessary or convenient to carry into effect such consolidation. The initial extension council for such new extension district shall consist of the members of the extension councils of the consolidated extension districts.

The extension council of the new extension district shall select a name for such district and shall file the name, together with copies of the resolution providing for such consolidation, with the recorder of each county affected thereby. The new extension district shall be regarded for all purposes as an extension district, the same as if such extension district consisted of a single county, and its extension council and officers thereof shall have all the powers and duties which now or hereafter may pertain to extension councils and officers thereof. All assets and liabilities of the consolidated extension districts shall become the assets and liabilities of the new extension district.

For the purposes of any law requiring extension districts to file any document with or certify any information to any county officer or board, an extension district formed by consolidation shall file or certify the same with or to the appropriate officer or board of each county included in the extension district. An extension district formed by consolidation may be dissolved and the original extension districts as they existed prior to such consolidation may be reestablished, by resolution duly adopted by the extension council of such extension district; and upon adoption of such resolution, the extension council shall do all things which may be necessary or convenient to carry into effect such dissolution and the reestablishment of the original extension districts.\n\n[C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §176A.15]",
