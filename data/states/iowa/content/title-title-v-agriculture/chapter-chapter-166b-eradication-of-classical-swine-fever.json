Disposal of condemned swine shall be under the supervision of a regulatory employee. Salvage of apparently healthy marketable swine is permissible as a minimum provision and may be discontinued in favor of total herd disposition with indemnification as necessary and without such salvage in any case or at any time when it is determined by the department and the United States department of agriculture that the procedure would constitute an undue threat to the eradication program. Before being condemned and ordered to be destroyed, a positive diagnosis of classical swine fever affecting the herd must be confirmed by a state or federal laboratory or personnel approved by the department and the United States department of agriculture.\n\n[C66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §166B.2]\n\n2012 Acts, ch 1095, §43",
