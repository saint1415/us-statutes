The production and processing of agricultural commodities and products represents the foundation of this state’s economy, and the economic viability of this nation is contingent upon the production of wealth generated primarily from materials, including food and fiber, produced on this nation’s family farms.\n\n2. It is necessary to support industries using agricultural commodities to increase the demand for and production and consumption of sources of energy in order to reduce the state’s dependency upon petroleum products; to reduce atmospheric contamination of this state’s environment from the combustion of fossil fuels; and to produce coproducts, such as corn gluten feed, distillers grain, and solubles, which can be used to increase livestock production in this state.\n\n3. This state adopts a policy of enhancing agricultural production by encouraging the development and use of fuels and coproducts derived from agricultural commodities as provided in this chapter, including rules adopted by the office of renewable fuels and coproducts.\n\n91 Acts, ch 254, §6; 94 Acts, ch 1119, §11; 2010 Acts, ch 1031, §238\n\nReferred to in §214A.31\n\nLegislative intent regarding use of renewable fuels;\n\n2013 Acts, ch 127, §1",
