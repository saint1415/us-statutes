When the secretary or the secretary’s authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any of the rules adopted under this chapter, the secretary or agent may issue and enforce a written or printed “withdrawal from distribution” order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the secretary or the court. The secretary shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when the provisions and rules have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within thirty days, the secretary may begin, or upon request of the distributor shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.\n\n2. Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with said provisions and rules shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the secretary to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which said commercial feed is located. In the event the court finds the said commercial feed to be in violation of this chapter and order the condemnation of said commercial feed, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the state, provided, that in no instance shall the disposition of said commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of said commercial feed or for permission to process or relabel said commercial feed to bring it into compliance with this chapter.\n\n[C66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §198.12]\n\n91 Acts, ch 97, §28\n\nReferred to in §198.8",

Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions of this chapter or who shall impede, hinder or otherwise prevent, or attempt to prevent, said secretary or the secretary’s authorized agent in performance of that person’s duty in connection with the provisions of this chapter, shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor.\n\n2. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the secretary or the secretary’s representative to:\n\na. Report for prosecution.\n\nb. Institute seizure proceedings.\n\nc. Issue a withdrawal from distribution order, as a result of minor violations of the chapter, or when the secretary or representative believes the public interest will best be served by suitable notice of warning in writing.\n\n3. It shall be the duty of each county attorney to whom any violation is reported to cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction without delay. Before the secretary reports a violation for such prosecution, an opportunity shall be given the distributor to present the distributor’s view to the secretary.\n\n4. The secretary may apply for and the court may grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of this chapter or any rule promulgated under the chapter notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law.
