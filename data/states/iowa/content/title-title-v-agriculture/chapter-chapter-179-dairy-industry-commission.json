When a national promotional order is established by the United States department of agriculture pursuant to the Dairy Product Stabilization Act of 1983, collection of the excise tax in section 179.5 shall be suspended for the period in which the national order is in effect. The commission shall continue to operate thereafter for only the period of time necessary to pay refunds and disburse the funds remaining in the dairy industry fund for the purposes enumerated in this chapter. Upon completion of these acts, the existence of the Iowa dairy industry commission shall be suspended. The secretary of agriculture shall certify the suspension of the commission as of a date certain to the Iowa dairy industry commission and the Iowa state dairy association.
