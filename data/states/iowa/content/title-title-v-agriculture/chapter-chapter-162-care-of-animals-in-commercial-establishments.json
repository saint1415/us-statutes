Except as provided in paragraph “b” or “c”, a commercial establishment shall comply with rules that the department adopts to implement subsection 1. A commercial establishment shall be regulated under this paragraph “a” unless the person is a state licensee as provided in paragraph “b” or a permittee as provided in paragraph “c”.\n\nb. A state licensee who is a commercial breeder owning, breeding, transporting, or keeping a greyhound dog for pari-mutuel wagering at a racetrack as provided in chapter 99D may be required to comply with different rules adopted by the department.\n\nc. A permittee is not required to comply with rules that the department adopts to implement a standard of care as provided in subsection 1 for state licensees and registrants. The department may adopt rules regulating a standard of care for a permittee, so long as the rules are not more restrictive than required for a permittee under the Animal Welfare Act. However, the department may adopt prescriptive rules relating to the standard of care. Regardless of whether the department adopts such rules, a permittee meets the standard of care required in subsection 1 if it voluntarily complies with rules applicable to state licensees or registrants. A finding by the United States department of agriculture that a permittee complies with the Animal Welfare Act is not conclusive when determining that the permittee provides a standard of care required in subsection 1.\n\n3.
