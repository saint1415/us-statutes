Inspections may be made at times and for purposes as the department determines. Except as provided in section 203C.6, the department shall inspect every licensed warehouse and its contents once every twelve months. The department shall prioritize inspections based on the system provided in section 203C.40. The department may require the filing of reports relating to a warehouse or its operation.\n\na. A licensed warehouse operator operating a licensed warehouse shall provide for complete and correct recordkeeping. The records shall account for the storage and withdrawal of all agricultural products handled in each warehouse which the warehouse operator is licensed to operate. The records shall include all original and duplicate receipts issued by, returned to, and canceled by the warehouse operator. A licensed warehouse operator shall keep records for the previous six years. If the licensed warehouse operator’s records are incomplete or inaccurate, the department may reconstruct the warehouse operator’s records in order to determine whether the warehouse operator is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The department may charge the licensed warehouse operator the actual cost for reconstructing the warehouse operator’s records.\n\nb. If upon inspection of a warehouse a deficiency is found to exist as to the quantity or quality of agricultural products stored, as indicated on the warehouse operator’s books and records according to official grain standards, the department may require an employee of the department to remain at the licensed warehouse and supervise all operations involving agricultural products stored there under this chapter until the deficiency is corrected. The charge for the cost of maintaining an employee of the department at a warehouse to supervise the correction of a deficiency is one hundred fifty dollars per day.\n\n3. The department may make available to the United States government, or any of its agencies, including the commodity credit corporation, the results of inspections made and inspection reports submitted to it by employees of the department, upon payment to it of charges as determined by the department, but the charges shall not be less than the actual cost of services rendered, as determined by the department.

The department in its discretion may, following summary suspension of a license under section 203C.10, or following a suspension or revocation of a license as otherwise provided in section 203C.10 or 203C.11, file a verified petition in the district court requesting that the department be appointed as a receiver to take custody of commodities stored in the licensee’s warehouse and to provide for the disposition of those assets in the manner provided in this chapter and under the supervision of the court. The petition shall be filed in the county in which the warehouse is located. The district court shall appoint the department as receiver. Upon the filing of the petition the court shall issue ex parte such temporary orders as may be necessary to preserve or protect the assets in receivership, or the value thereof, and the rights of depositors, until a plan of disposition is approved.\n\n2. A petition filed by the department under subsection 1 shall be accompanied by the department’s plan for disposition of stored commodities. The plan may provide for the pro rata delivery of part or all of the stored commodities to depositors holding warehouse receipts or unpriced scale weight tickets, or may provide for the sale under the supervision of the department of part or all of the stored commodities for the benefit of those depositors, or may provide for any combination thereof, as the department in its discretion determines to be necessary to minimize losses.\n\n3. When a petition is filed by the department under subsection 1 the clerk of court shall set a date for hearing on the department’s proposed plan of disposition at a time not less than ten nor more than fifteen days after the date the petition is filed. Copies of the petition, the notice of hearing, and the department’s plan of disposition shall be served upon the licensee and upon the issuer of a deficiency bond or of an irrevocable letter of credit pursuant to section 203C.6 in the manner required for service of an original notice. A delay in effecting service upon the licensee or issuer is not cause for denying the appointment of a receiver and is not grounds for invalidating any action or proceeding in connection with the appointment.\n\n4. The department shall cause a copy of each of the documents served upon the licensee under subsection 3 to be mailed by ordinary mail to every person holding a warehouse receipt or unpriced scale weight ticket issued by the licensee, as determined by the records of the licensee or the records of the department. The failure of any person referred to in this subsection to receive the required notification shall not invalidate the proceedings on the petition for the appointment of a receiver or any portion thereof. Persons referred to in this subsection are not parties to the action unless admitted by the court upon application therefor.\n\n5. When appointed as a receiver under this chapter, the department shall cause notification of the appointment to be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the counties in which the licensee maintains a business location, and in a newspaper of general circulation in this state.\n\n6. The department may designate an employee of the department to appear on behalf of the department in any proceedings before the court with respect to the receivership, and to exercise the functions of the department as receiver under this section and section 203C.4, except that the department shall determine whether or not to petition for appointment as receiver, shall approve the proposed plan for disposition of stored commodities, shall approve the proposed plan for distribution of any cash proceeds, and shall approve the proposed final report.\n\n7. The actions of the department in connection with petitioning for appointment as a receiver, and all actions pursuant to such appointment, shall not be subject to the provisions of the administrative procedure Act, chapter 17A.\n\n8.

When the department is appointed as receiver under this chapter the issuer of a deficiency bond or of an irrevocable letter of credit pursuant to section 203C.6 shall be joined as a party defendant by the department. If required by the court, the issuer shall pay the indemnification proceeds or so much thereof as the court finds necessary into the court, and when so paid the issuer shall be absolutely discharged from any further liability under the bond or irrevocable letter of credit to the extent of the payment.\n\n2. When appointed as receiver under this chapter the department is authorized to give notice in the manner specified by the court to persons holding warehouse receipts or other evidence of deposit issued by the licensee to file their claims within one hundred twenty days after the date of appointment. Failure to timely file a claim shall defeat the claim with respect to the issuer of a deficiency bond or of an irrevocable letter of credit, grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund created in chapter 203D, and any commodities or proceeds from the sale of commodities, except to the extent of any excess commodities or proceeds of sale remaining after all timely claims are paid in full.\n\n3. When the court approves the sale of commodities, the department shall employ a merchandiser to effect the sale of those commodities. A person employed or appointed as a merchandiser is deemed to be an employee of the state as defined in section 669.2 and chapter 669 is applicable to any claim as defined in section 669.2 against the person acting as a merchandiser. A person employed as a merchandiser must meet the following requirements:\n\na. The person shall be experienced or knowledgeable in the operation of warehouses licensed under this chapter; and if the person has ever held a license issued under this chapter, the person shall never have had that license suspended or revoked.\n\nb.

The person shall not be the holder of a warehouse receipt or scale weight ticket issued by the licensee, and shall not have a claim against the licensee whether as a secured or unsecured creditor, and otherwise shall not have any pecuniary interest in the licensee or the licensee’s business. The merchandiser shall be entitled to reasonable compensation as determined by the department, payable out of funds appropriated for operating expenses of the department. A sale of commodities shall be made in a commercially reasonable manner and under the supervision of the warehouse bureau of the department. The department shall provide for the payment out of appropriations to the department of all expenses incurred in handling and disposing of commodities. The department shall have authority to sell the commodities, any provision of chapter 554 to the contrary notwithstanding, and any commodities so sold shall be free of all liens and other encumbrances.\n\n4. The plan of disposition, as approved by the court, shall provide for the distribution of the stored commodities, or the proceeds from the sale of commodities, or the proceeds from any insurance policy, deficiency bond, or irrevocable letter of credit, less expenses incurred by the department in connection with the receivership, to depositors as their interests are determined. Distribution shall be without regard to any setoff, counterclaim, or storage lien or charge.\n\n5. The department may, with the approval of the court, continue the operation of all or any part of the business of the licensee on a temporary basis and take any other course of action or procedure which will serve the interests of the depositors.\n\n6. The department is entitled to reimbursement out of commodities or proceeds held in receivership for all expenses incurred as court costs or in handling and disposing of stored commodities, and for all other costs directly attributable to the receivership. The right of reimbursement of the department is prior to any claims against the commodities or proceeds of sales of commodities, and constitutes a claim against a deficiency bond or irrevocable letter of credit.\n\n7. If the approved plan of disposition requires a distribution of cash proceeds, the department shall submit to the court a proposed plan of distribution of those proceeds. Upon notice and hearing as required by the court, the court shall accept or modify the proposed plan. When the plan is approved by the court and executed by the department, the department shall be discharged and the receivership terminated.\n\n8.

A statutory lien is imposed on all warehouse operator assets in favor of depositors possessing warehouse receipts covering grain stored by the warehouse operator and depositors with written evidence of ownership other than warehouse receipts disclosing a storage obligation of a warehouse operator.\n\n2. “Warehouse operator assets” includes proceeds received or due a warehouse operator upon the sale, including exchange, collection, or other disposition, of grain sold by the warehouse operator. As used in this section, “proceeds” means noncash and cash proceeds as defined in section 554.9102. “Warehouse operator assets” also includes storage payments received or due to a warehouse operator, grain owned by the warehouse operator, and any other funds or property of the warehouse operator which can be directly traced as being from the sale of grain by the warehouse operator, or which were utilized in the business operation of the warehouse operator. A court, upon petition by an affected party, may order that claimed warehouse operator assets are not warehouse operator assets as defined in this section. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to establish that the assets are not warehouse operator assets as defined in this section.\n\n3. The lien shall arise at the commencement of the storage obligation, and shall terminate when the liability of the warehouse operator to the depositor has been discharged. The lien of all depositors is hereby assigned to the Iowa grain indemnity fund board, on behalf of the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund.\n\n4. To perfect the lien, the Iowa grain indemnity fund board must file a lien statement with the office of the secretary of state. The lien statement is valid only if filed on or after the date of suspension but not later than sixty days after the incurrence date as provided in section 203D.6. The lien statement shall disclose the name of the warehouse operator, the address of the warehouse operator’s principal place of business, a description of identifiable warehouse operator assets, and the amount of the lien. The lien amount shall be the board’s estimate of the final cost of reimbursing the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund for the payment of claims made against the fund resulting from the breach of the warehouse operator’s obligations. The board shall correct the amount not later than one hundred eighty days following the incurrence date. A court, upon petition by an affected person, may correct the amount. The board shall have the burden of proving that the amount is an accurate estimate.\n\n5. The Iowa grain indemnity fund board shall upon written demand of the warehouse operator file a termination statement with the secretary of state, if after one hundred eighty days from the date that the lien is perfected the warehouse operator’s license has not ceased by revocation, cancellation, or expiration. Upon filing the termination statement, the lien becomes unperfected. The board shall also deliver a copy of the termination statement to the warehouse operator.\n\n6. The secretary of state shall note the filing of a lien statement under this section in a manner provided by chapter 554, the uniform commercial code. The secretary shall note the filing of a termination statement with the lien statement.\n\n7. A lien statement filed under this section shall be a security interest perfected under chapter 554 and subject to the same priority as provided under section 554.9322.\n\n8. In the event the department is appointed as a receiver under section 203C.3, assets under the authority of the receiver are free from this statutory lien. However, if there are receivership assets in excess of those necessary to fully reimburse depositors, the perfected lien will attach to those excess assets.\n\n9. a. The Iowa grain indemnity fund board may enforce the lien in the manner provided in chapter 554, article 9, part 6, for the enforcement of security interests. If, upon enforcement of the lien, the lien amount is satisfied in full without exhaustion of the warehouse operator assets, the remaining assets shall be returned to the warehouse operator or, if there are competing claims to those remaining assets by other creditors, those assets shall be placed in the custody of the district court and the known creditors impleaded.\n\nb. For purposes of enforcement of the lien, the board is deemed to be the secured party and the warehouse operator is deemed to be the debtor, and each has the respective rights and duties of a secured party and a debtor as provided in chapter 554, article 9, part 6. If a right or duty under chapter 554, article 9, part 6, is contingent upon the existence of express language in a security agreement, or may be waived by express language in a security agreement, the requisite language is deemed not to exist for purposes of enforcement of the lien created by this section.\n\n10.
