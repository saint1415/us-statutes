If, during an action initiated under this chapter or any other chapter in which a child or medical support obligation may be established based upon a prior determination of paternity,a party wishes to contest the paternity of the child or children involved, all of the followingapply:\n\na.\n\n(1) If paternity has been legally established by one of the methods enumerated in section 252A.3, subsection 10, or by operation of law due to the established father’s marriageto the mother at the time of conception, birth, or at any time during the period betweenconception and birth of the child, the provisions of section 600B.41A apply. (2) If following the proceedings under section 600B.41A the court determines that the prior determination of paternity should not be overcome, and that the established fatherhas a duty to provide support, the court shall enter an order establishing the monthly childsupport payment and the amount of the support debt accrued and accruing pursuant tosection 598.21B, or the medical support obligation pursuant to chapter 252E, or both.\n\nb.\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph\n\n“a”\n\n, subparagraph (1), if a determination of paternity is based on an administrative or court order or other means pursuant to the laws of another stateor foreign country as defined in chapter 252K, any action to overcome the prior determinationof paternity shall be filed in that jurisdiction. Unless a stay of the action initiated in thisstate to establish child or medical support is requested and granted by the court, pending aresolution of the contested paternity issue by the other state or foreign country as defined inchapter 252K, the action shall proceed.\n\nc.\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph\n\n“a”\n\n, in a pending dissolution action under this chapter, a prior determination of paternity by operation of law through the marriage of the establishedfather and mother of the child may be overcome under this chapter if the established fatherand mother of the child file a written statement with the court that both parties agree that theestablished father is not the biological father of the child. 2. If the court overcomes a prior determination of paternity, the previously established father shall be relieved of support obligations as specified in section 600B.41A, subsection5. In any action to overcome paternity other than through a pending dissolution action,the provisions of section 600B.41A apply. Overcoming paternity under subsection 1, paragraph\n\n“c”\n\n, does not bar subsequent actions to establish paternity. A subsequent action to establish paternity against the previously established father is not barred if it issubsequently determined that the written statement attesting that the established father isnot the biological father of the child may have been submitted erroneously, and that theperson previously determined not to be the child’s father during the dissolution action mayactually be the child’s biological father. 3.
