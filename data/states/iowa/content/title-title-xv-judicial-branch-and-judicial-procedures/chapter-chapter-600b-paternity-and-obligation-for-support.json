If a blood or genetic test is required, the court shall direct that inherited characteristics be determined by appropriate testing procedures, and shall appoint an expert qualified as anexaminer of genetic markers to analyze and interpret the results and to report to the court.Appropriate testing procedures shall include any genetic test generally acknowledged asreliable by accreditation bodies designated by the secretary of the United States departmentof health and human services and which are performed by a laboratory approved by such anaccreditation body. 3.
