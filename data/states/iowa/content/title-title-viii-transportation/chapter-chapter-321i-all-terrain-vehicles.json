The owner of an all-terrain vehicle used exclusively as a farm implement may obtain a certificate of title. A person who owns an all-terrain vehicle that is not required to have a certificate of title may apply for and receive a certificate of title for the all-terrain vehicle and, subsequently, the all-terrain vehicle shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter as if the all-terrain vehicle were required to be titled. All all-terrain vehicles that are titled shall be registered.\n\n2. A certificate of title shall contain the information and shall be issued on a form the department prescribes.\n\n3. An owner of an all-terrain vehicle shall apply to the county recorder for issuance of a certificate of title within thirty days after acquisition. The application shall be on forms the department prescribes and accompanied by the required fee specified in section 321I.32 and the writing fee specified in section 321I.29.

The form and amount of the bond shall be established by rule of the department. The bond shall be conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and secured party and any subsequent purchaser of the all-terrain vehicle or person acquiring any security interest in the all-terrain vehicle, and their respective successors in interest, against any expense, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorney fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificate of title of the all-terrain vehicle or on account of any defect in or undisclosed security interest upon the right, title, and interest of the applicant in and to the all-terrain vehicle. Any such interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons shall not exceed the amount of the bond. The bond shall be returned at the end of three years or prior thereto if the all-terrain vehicle is no longer registered in this state and the certificate of title is surrendered to the department, unless the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond.\n\n10.
