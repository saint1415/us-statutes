As used in this section, “off-premises advertising device” means an advertising device which does not qualify as an “on-premises sign” under rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\n2. Just compensation required. Political subdivisions of this state shall not remove, take, alter, or cause to be removed, taken, or altered a lawfully erected off-premises advertising device without paying just compensation in cash to the owner of the advertising device and to the owner of the real property on which the advertising device is located, as provided in section 306C.16. The department shall not remove, take, alter or cause to be removed, taken, or altered a lawfully erected off-premises advertising device subject to control under chapter 306B or this chapter without paying just compensation when required under 23 U.S.C. §131(g) to the owner of the advertising device and to the owner of the real property on which the advertising device is located, as provided in section 306C.16. For the department, the sole intent of this section is to comply with 23 U.S.C. §131(g) and it is not the intent of this section to, in any manner, relinquish any powers of the department relating to the control and removal of advertising devices under police power.\n\n3. Exceptions. This section does not apply to the removal, taking, or altering of an off-premises advertising device under any of the following conditions:\n\na. The device is unlawfully erected or is being maintained in violation of the provisions of section 306C.13, subsection 7, or section 306C.18.\n\nb. The device has been abandoned or not used for a period of at least six months.\n\n4. Department authorization. If required by 23 U.S.C. §131(g), the department may acquire through purchase or condemnation and shall pay just compensation as provided in section 306C.16 for off-premises advertising devices removed after July 1, 1989, through amortization by an ordinance of a political subdivision enacted prior to July 1, 1989. Notwithstanding the requirements of section 306C.14, the department may first pay just compensation from the highway beautification fund and then claim reimbursement for the federal share of the payment from the federal government.\n\n5. Savings clause. If any provision of this section which relates to the department is inconsistent or conflicts with, or is not required by, 23 U.S.C. §131 to avoid the loss of federal funds, the provision shall be suspended but only to the extent necessary to eliminate the inconsistency, conflict, or requirement. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unconstitutional, such judgment shall not affect the validity of the section as a whole or any provision or part of the section not found to be invalid or unconstitutional.\n\n89 Acts, ch 317, §25; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §83\n\nReferred to in §306C.16",
