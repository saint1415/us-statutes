The department is hereby granted wide discretion, in connection with the financing of the cost of any toll bridge, to pledge the gross revenues of a single toll bridge for the payment of bonds and interest thereon issued to pay the cost of such bridge and to pledge the gross revenues of two or more toll bridges to pay bonds issued to pay the cost of one or more toll bridges and interest thereon as long as the several bridges included herein are not more than ten miles apart.\n\n2. In addition, if the department in its discretion determines that the construction of a toll bridge cannot be financed entirely through revenue bonds and that the construction of such toll bridge is necessary, the department may advance funds from the primary highway fund to pay for that part of the construction cost, including the cost of approaches and all incidental costs, which is not paid out of the proceeds of revenue bonds. However, said funds advanced from the primary highway fund shall be used only to pay the construction cost, including the cost of approaches and all incidental costs, with respect to that part of the bridge which is or will be located within the state of Iowa. After all revenue bonds and interest thereon issued and sold pursuant to this chapter and payable from the tolls and revenues of said bridge have been fully paid and redeemed or funds sufficient to pay said bonds and interest, including premium, if any, have been set aside and pledged for that purpose, then such amount advanced from the primary road fund shall be repaid to the primary road fund from the tolls and revenues of said bridge before said bridge is made a toll free bridge under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §313A.7]\n\nReferred to in §313A.16",

Any issue or series of refunding bonds may be exchanged in part or sold in part in installments at different times or at one time. The refunding bonds may be sold at any time on, before, or after the maturity of any of the outstanding bonds to be refinanced thereby and may be issued for the purpose of refunding a like or greater principal amount of bonds, except that the principal amount of the refunding bonds may exceed the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded to the extent necessary to pay any premium due on the call of the bonds to be refunded or to fund interest in arrears or about to become due.

However, said annual primary road fund receipts shall be used only to pay such costs and charges with respect to that part of the bridge which is located within the state of Iowa.\n\n4.
