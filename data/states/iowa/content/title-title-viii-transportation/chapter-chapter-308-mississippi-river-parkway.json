The state transportation commission shall make such investigations, surveys, studies and plans in connection with any proposed national parkway or parkway development as it shall deem necessary or desirable to determine if the proposed development is under the terms of the Act of the United States Congress applicable to such parkway or any regulations under such Act and is advantageous to the state. Such parkway development may be any portion of the proposed parkway which is proposed to be constructed as a project under such Act.\n\n2. The state transportation commission, with the cooperation of the department of natural resources, shall plan, designate, and establish the exact routing of the great river road, utilizing the general guidelines established in Tit. 23, United States Code.\n\n3. The director of transportation, with the cooperation of the department of natural resources, shall:\n\na. Acquire all rights in land necessary for reconstruction or relocation of any portions of the great river road where reconstruction or relocation is imperative for the safety of the traveling public, or where the condition or location of existing segments of the highway is not in keeping with the intent of this chapter. Acquisitions of such rights in land shall be by gift, purchase, exchange, or by instituting and maintaining proceedings for condemnation. Gift, purchase, exchange, and condemnation include acquisition of a scenic easement. A scenic easement acquired under this chapter constitutes an easement both at law and in equity, and all legal and equitable remedies, including prohibitory and mandatory injunctions, are available to protect and enforce the state’s interest in such scenic easements. A scenic easement acquired under this chapter is deemed to be appurtenant to the roadway to which it is adjacent or from which it is visible. The duties created by a scenic easement acquired under this chapter are binding upon and enforceable against the original owner of the land subject to the scenic easement and the original owner’s heirs, successors, and assigns in perpetuity, unless the instrument creating the scenic easement expressly provides for a lesser duration. A court shall not declare a scenic easement acquired under this chapter to have been extinguished or to have become unenforceable by virtue of changed conditions or frustration of purpose.\n\nb. Accept and administer state, federal, and any other public or private funds made available for the acquisition of rights in land and for the planning and construction or reconstruction of any segment of the great river road, and state and federal funds for the maintenance of that part of the great river road constituting the right-of-way.\n\n[C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §308.4; 81 Acts, ch 14, §23]\n\n83 Acts, ch 198, §17; 85 Acts, ch 108, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §1929; 86 Acts, ch 1246, §28; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §45\n\nReferred to in §308.7",

When, as a result of its investigations and studies, the state transportation commission, in cooperation with the department of natural resources, finds that there may be a need in the future for the development and construction or reconstruction of segments of the great river road, and when the state transportation commission determines that in order to prevent conflicting costly economic development on areas of lands to be available for the great river road when needed for future development, there is need to establish and to inform the public of the approximate location and widths of new or improved segments of the great river road to be needed, the state transportation commission may proceed to establish the location and the approximate widths in the manner provided in this section.\n\nb. The state transportation commission shall give notice and hold a public hearing on the matter in a convenient place in the area to be affected by the proposed improvement of the great river road. The state transportation commission shall consider and evaluate the testimony presented at the public hearing and shall make a study and prepare a map showing the location of the proposed new or reconstructed segment of the great river road and the approximate widths of right-of-way needed. The map shall show the existing roadway and the property lines and record owners of lands to be needed. The approval of the map shall be recorded by reference in the state transportation commission’s minutes, and a notice of the action and a copy of the map showing the lands or interest in the lands needed in any county shall be filed in the office of the county recorder of that county. Notice of the action and of the filing shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, and within sixty days following the filing, notice of the filing shall be served by registered mail on the owners of record on the date of filing. Using the same procedures for approval, notice and publications, and notice to the affected record owners, the state transportation commission may amend the map.\n\n2. After such location is established, within the area of the great river road as shown on the map or in such proximity to it as to result in consequential damages when the rights in land for the great river road are acquired, a person shall not erect or move in any additional structure or rebuild, alter or add to any existing structure, without giving to the state transportation commission by registered mail sixty days’ notice of such contemplated construction, alteration, or addition describing the same. However, this prohibition and requirement shall not apply to any normal or emergency repairs or replacements which are necessary to maintain an existing structure of a facility in approximately its previously existing functioning condition. When the rights in land for a segment of the great river road are acquired, damages shall not be allowed for any construction, alterations, or additions in violation of this subsection.\n\n3. Without limiting any authority otherwise existing, rights in land needed for the great river road may be acquired at any time by the state, the county, or the municipality in which such segment of the great river road is located. If an owner’s contiguous land is acquired to an extent which is less than the total amount shown on the map as needed, consequential damages to the land not acquired shall be allowed as found to exist.\n\n[C62, 66, 71, 73, §308.5; C75, 77, 79, 81, §308.9]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1158, §64; 98 Acts, ch 1075, §8; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §46",
