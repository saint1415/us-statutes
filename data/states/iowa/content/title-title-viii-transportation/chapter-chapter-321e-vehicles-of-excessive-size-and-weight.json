The department and local authorities may in their discretion and upon application and with good cause shown issue permits for the movement of special mobile equipment being temporarily moved on streets, roads, or highways and for vehicles with indivisible loads, or divisible loads where expressly authorized under this chapter, which exceed the maximum dimensions and weights specified in sections 321.452 through 321.466, but not to exceed the limitations imposed in this section and sections 321E.3 through 321E.15 except as provided in section 321E.29.\n\n2. Vehicles permitted to transport indivisible loads may do any of the following:\n\na. Exceed the width and length limitations specified in sections 321.454 and 321.457 for the purpose of picking up an indivisible load or returning from delivery of the indivisible load. Vehicles with retractable body extensions used to support cargo must be reduced to legal dimensions unless the vehicle is loaded and the extension is in use.\n\nb. Move indivisible special mobile equipment which does not otherwise exceed the maximum dimensions and weights specified in sections 321.452 through 321.466 if the vehicle has an overall width not to exceed nine feet and all other conditions of the vehicle’s permit are met.\n\n3. A permit issued under this chapter shall be in writing or in an electronic format and shall be carried in the cab of the vehicle for which the permit has been issued. Permits issued under this chapter and the vehicle for which the permit has been issued shall be open to inspection at all times by any peace officer or an authorized agent of any permit-issuing authority.\n\n4. When in the judgment of the permit-issuing authority the movement of a vehicle with an indivisible or divisible load or special mobile equipment which exceeds the maximum dimensions and weights will be unduly hazardous to public safety or will cause undue damage to infrastructure or other public or private property, the permit shall be denied and the reasons for denial endorsed on the application. Permits shall designate the days when and routes upon which loads and special mobile equipment may be moved within a county on other than primary roads.\n\n5. A permit-issuing authority may allow persons requesting permits under this chapter to do so in person, through the internet, by facsimile machine, or by telephone, authorizing payment for the permits to be made upon receipt of an invoice sent to the persons by the permit-issuing authority.\n\n[C31, 35, §5067-d7, -d8; C39, §5035.16, 5035.18, 5035.19; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, §321.467, 321.469, 321.470; C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321E.1]\n\n83 Acts, ch 116, §3; 85 Acts, ch 257, §20; 94 Acts, ch 1087, §9, 10; 96 Acts, ch 1089, §5; 96 Acts, ch 1152, §19; 2008 Acts, ch 1124, §9; 2013 Acts, ch 49, §2, 28\n\nC2014, §321E.2\n\n2022 Acts, ch 1076, §2, 8\n\nReferred to in §321E.8, 321E.9, 321E.9A, 321E.9B",

However, the department may issue permits on primary road extensions in cities in conjunction with movements on the rural primary road system.\n\nb. (1) The department may issue all-systems permits under section 321E.8 which are valid for movement on all paved highways or streets, except the interstate road system if prohibited under section 321E.8, and except any highways or streets under the jurisdiction of local authorities upon which an all-systems permit is not valid as determined by the applicable local authority if the local authority indicates such highways and streets to the department in writing, including by means of electronic communication. However, a local authority shall not determine that any paved farm-to-market road, or highway or street designated as a truck route, is not valid for purposes of an all-systems permit without justification. A highway or street under the jurisdiction of a local authority upon which movement under an all-systems permit is valid shall connect with a highway or street under the jurisdiction of the state, or with another highway or street upon which movement under an all-systems permit is valid that ultimately connects with a highway or street under the jurisdiction of the state.\n\n(2) A local authority that indicates a highway or street, including a paved farm-to-market road, upon which an all-systems permit is not valid under subparagraph (1) shall provide a written justification report to the department explaining the local authority’s determination. If the department disagrees with the local authority’s determination, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with chapter 17A.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding a local authority’s determination under this paragraph, a person who is issued an all-systems permit may operate a permitted vehicle over the most direct route between the location where the vehicle is loaded or is to be unloaded and the nearest highway or street upon which movement under an all-systems permit is valid.\n\n2. At the request of a local authority, the department shall issue permits under this chapter for highways or streets that are under the jurisdiction of the local authority if the local authority has indicated to the department in writing, including by means of electronic communication, those streets or highways for which a permit is not valid.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the department shall develop and implement a single statewide system to receive applications for and issue permits authorized under this chapter that allow for the operation of vehicles of excessive size or weight on highways or streets under the jurisdiction of the state or local authorities. The department is authorized to determine, in consultation with the applicable local authorities, the network of highways and streets under the jurisdiction of local authorities, including the appropriate routes, on which vehicles issued permits under the system are authorized to operate. Permits issued under the system shall be issued by the department for a fee established by the department by rule, which fees shall be proportionate to the fees set forth in section 321E.14. The department shall allocate a portion of the fees collected under this subsection to local authorities having jurisdiction over highways or streets on which vehicles issued permits under the system are authorized to operate.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321E.2]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1210, §7; 94 Acts, ch 1087, §11; 96 Acts, ch 1089, §6; 2007 Acts, ch 143, §18; 2013 Acts, ch 49, §3, 28\n\nC2014, §321E.3\n\n2019 Acts, ch 15, §2; 2019 Acts, ch 158, §2; 2022 Acts, ch 1076, §3, 8; 2023 Acts, ch 60, §1\n\nReferred to in §321E.2, 321E.26\n\nFarm-to-market roads, see chapter 310\n\nOn or before July 1, 2025, every county shall authorize vehicles issued a permit under section 321E.8, subsection 2, to operate on certain secondary roads and indicate to the department of transportation in writing, including by means of electronic communication, those secondary roads for which a permit under section 321E.8, subsection 2, is not valid;\n\n2022 Acts, ch 1076, §7\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph b amended",
