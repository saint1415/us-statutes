Article I — Findings and purposes.\n\na. The party states find that:\n\n(1) Accidents and deaths on their streets and highways present a very serious human and economic problem with a major deleterious effect on the public welfare.\n\n(2) There is a vital need for the development of greater interjurisdictional cooperation to achieve the necessary uniformity in the laws, rules, regulations and codes relating to vehicle equipment, and to accomplish this by such means as will minimize the time between the development of demonstrably and scientifically sound safety features and their incorporation into vehicles.\n\nb. The purposes of this compact are to:\n\n(1) Promote uniformity in regulation of and standards for equipment.\n\n(2) Secure uniformity of law and administrative practice in vehicular regulation and related safety standards to permit incorporation of desirable equipment changes in vehicles in the interest of greater traffic safety.\n\n(3) To provide means for the encouragement and utilization of research which will facilitate the achievement of the foregoing purposes, with due regard for the findings set forth in paragraph “a” of this article.\n\nc. It is the intent of this compact to emphasize performance requirements and not to determine the specific detail of engineering in the manufacture of vehicles or equipment except to the extent necessary for the meeting of such performance requirements.\n\n2.

Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director with the approval of the commission, or the commission if there be no executive director, shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the commission’s functions, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.\n\nf. The commission may establish and maintain independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees.

Collect, correlate, analyze and evaluate information resulting or derivable from research and testing activities in equipment and related fields.\n\nb.

Article V — Vehicular equipment.\n\na. In the interest of vehicular and public safety, the commission may study the need for or desirability of the establishment of or changes in performance requirements or restrictions for any item of equipment. As a result of such study, the commission may publish a report relating to any item or items of equipment, and the issuance of such a report shall be a condition precedent to any proceedings or other action provided or authorized by this article.

The commission shall send prompt notice of its action in issuing any rule, regulation or code pursuant to this article to the appropriate motor vehicle agency of each party state and such notice shall contain the complete text of the rule, regulation or code.\n\ne. If the constitution of a party state requires, or if its statutes provide, the approval of the legislature by appropriate resolution or act may be made a condition precedent to the taking effect in such party state of any rule, regulation or code. In such event, the commissioner of such party state shall submit any commission rule, regulation or code to the legislature as promptly as may be in lieu of administrative acceptance or rejection thereof by the party state.\n\nf. Except as otherwise specifically provided in or pursuant to paragraphs “e” and “g” of this article, the appropriate motor vehicle agency of a party state shall in accordance with its constitution or procedural laws adopt the rule, regulation or code within six months of the sending of the notice, and, upon such adoption, the rule, regulation or code shall have the force and effect of law therein.\n\ng. The appropriate motor vehicle agency of a party state may decline to adopt a rule, regulation or code issued by the commission pursuant to this article if such agency specifically finds, after public hearing on due notice, that a variation from the commission’s rule, regulation or code is necessary to the public safety, and incorporates in such finding the reasons upon which it is based. Any such finding shall be subject to review by such procedure for review of administrative determinations as may be applicable pursuant to the laws of the party state. Upon request, the commission shall be furnished with a copy of the transcript of any hearings held pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n6. Article VI — Finance.\n\na. The commission shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.\n\nb.

The total amount of appropriations under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: One-third in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the number of motor vehicles registered in each party state. In determining the number of such registrations, the commission may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning vehicular registrations.\n\nc. The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under article III, paragraph “h” of this compact, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under article III, paragraph “h” hereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.\n\nd. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its rules.

The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.\n\nf. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.\n\n7. Article VII — Conflict of interest.\n\na. The commission shall adopt rules and regulations with respect to conflict of interest for the commissioners of the party states, and their alternates, if any, and for the staff of the commission and contractors with the commission to the end that no member or employee or contractor shall have a pecuniary or other incompatible interest in the manufacture, sale or distribution of motor vehicles or vehicular equipment or in any facility or enterprise employed by the commission or on its behalf for testing, conduct of investigations or research. In addition to any penalty for violation of such rules and regulations as may be applicable under the laws of the violator’s jurisdiction of residence, employment or business, any violation of a commission rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article shall require the immediate discharge of any violating employee and the immediate vacating of membership, or relinquishing of status as a member on the commission by any commissioner or alternate. In the case of a contractor, any violation of any such rule or regulation shall make any contract of the violator with the commission subject to cancellation by the commission.\n\nb. Nothing contained in this article shall be deemed to prevent a contractor for the commission from using any facilities subject to the contractor’s control in the performance of the contract even though such facilities are not devoted solely to work of or done on behalf of the commission; nor to prevent such a contractor from receiving remuneration or profit from the use of such facilities.\n\n8. Article VIII — Advisory and technical committees. The commission may establish such advisory and technical committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which may include private citizens and public officials, and may cooperate with and use the services of any such committees and the organizations which the members represent in furthering any of its activities.\n\n9.
