Each county, through the county board of supervisors, within the region shall be responsible for determining the service and funding within its own county. However, the administration and overhead support services for the regional transit system shall be consolidated into one existing or new agency to be mutually agreed upon by the participating members.\n\n6. “Transportation” means the movement of individuals in a four or more wheeled motorized vehicle designed to carry passengers, including a car, van, or bus, between one geographic point and another geographic point. “Transportation” does not include emergency or incidental transportation or transportation conducted by the department of health and human services at its institutions.\n\n7. “Transportation disadvantaged persons” means persons with physical or mental disabilities, persons who are determined by the department to be economically disadvantaged and other persons or groups determined by the department to be disadvantaged in terms of the transportation services that are available to them.\n\n8. “Urban transit system” means a system designated by the department in which motor buses are operated primarily upon the streets of cities for the transportation of passengers who present themselves for transportation without discrimination up to the limit of the capacity of each motor bus. “Urban transit system” also includes motor buses operated upon the streets of adjoining cities, whether interstate or intrastate for the transportation of passengers without discrimination up to the limit of the capacity of each motor bus. A privately chartered bus service or interurban carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation is not an urban transit system.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §601J.1]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1200, §1\n\nC93, §324A.1\n\n96 Acts, ch 1129, §80; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1079\n\nReferred to in §321.1, 321.377, 321E.11, 423.3\n\nSubsection 6 amended",

The report shall list all of the funding sources of the organization along with the listing of funds expended by that organization during the preceding fiscal year. The department, in cooperation with the regional planning agencies as the responsible agency for annual updating the regional transit development programs, shall compile this information annually. A state agency or organization administering funds for transit services is required to submit all funding requests through the regional and state clearinghouse and the department. An organization, state agency, political subdivision, or public transit system, except public school transportation, receiving federal, state, or local aid to provide or contract for public transit services or transportation to the general public and specific client groups, must coordinate and consolidate funding and resulting service, to the maximum extent possible, with the urban or regional transit system.\n\n2. a.

The department shall biennially prepare a report to be submitted to the general assembly and the governor prior to December 15 of even-numbered years. The report shall recommend methods to increase transportation coordination and improve the efficiency of federal, state, and local government programs used to finance public transit services and may address other topics as appropriate.
