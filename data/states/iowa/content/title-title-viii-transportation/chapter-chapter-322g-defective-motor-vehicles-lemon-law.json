The general assembly further recognizes that a duly franchised motor vehicle dealer is an authorized service agent of the manufacturer. It is the intent of the general assembly that a good faith motor vehicle warranty complaint by a consumer be resolved by the manufacturer within a specified period of time. It is further the intent of the general assembly to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the warranty provided for in this chapter. However, this chapter does not limit the rights or remedies which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.\n\n91 Acts, ch 153, §1",

The written statement shall be prepared by the attorney general and shall contain a telephone number that the consumer can use to obtain information from the attorney general regarding the rights and obligations provided under this chapter.\n\n2. At the time of the consumer’s purchase or lease of the vehicle, the manufacturer shall provide to the consumer the address and phone number for the zone, district, or regional office of the manufacturer for this state where a claim may be filed by the consumer. This information shall be provided to the consumer in a clear and conspicuous manner. Within thirty days of the introduction of a new model year for each make and model of motor vehicle sold in this state, the manufacturer shall notify the attorney general of such introduction.

A manufacturer or the authorized service agent of the manufacturer shall make repairs as necessary to conform the vehicle to the warranty if a motor vehicle does not conform to the warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer or authorized service agent during the lemon law rights period. Such repairs shall be made irrespective of whether they can be made prior to the expiration of the lemon law rights period.\n\n4. A manufacturer or the authorized service agent of the manufacturer, shall provide to the consumer, each time the motor vehicle is returned after being examined or repaired under the warranty, a fully itemized, legible statement or repair order indicating any diagnosis made, and all work performed on the motor vehicle including, but not limited to, a general description of the problem reported by the consumer or an identification of the defect or condition, parts and labor, the date and the odometer reading when the motor vehicle was submitted for examination or repair, and the date when the repair or examination was completed.\n\n5.

After three attempts have been made to repair the same nonconformity that substantially impairs the motor vehicle, or after one attempt to repair a nonconformity that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, the consumer may give written notification, which shall be by certified or registered mail or by overnight service, to the manufacturer of the need to repair the nonconformity in order to allow the manufacturer a final attempt to cure the nonconformity. The manufacturer shall, within ten days after receipt of such notification, notify and provide the consumer with the opportunity to have the vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility and after delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall, within ten days, conform the motor vehicle to the warranty. If the manufacturer fails to notify and provide the consumer with the opportunity to have the vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility or perform the repairs within the time periods prescribed in this subsection, the requirement that the manufacturer be given a final attempt to cure the nonconformity does not apply.\n\nb. After twenty or more cumulative days when the motor vehicle has been out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities, the consumer may give written notification to the manufacturer which shall be by certified or registered mail or by overnight service. Commencing upon the date such notification is received, the manufacturer has ten cumulative days when the vehicle has been out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities to conform the motor vehicle to the warranty.\n\n2. a. If the manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, has not conformed the motor vehicle to the warranty by repairing or correcting one or more nonconformities that substantially impair the motor vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall, within forty days of receipt of payment by the manufacturer of a reasonable offset for use by the consumer, replace the motor vehicle with a replacement motor vehicle acceptable to the consumer, or repurchase the motor vehicle from the consumer or lessor and refund to the consumer or lessor the full purchase or lease price, less a reasonable offset for use. The replacement or refund shall include payment of all collateral and reasonably incurred incidental charges. The consumer has an unconditional right to choose a refund rather than a replacement. If the consumer elects to receive a refund, and the refund exceeds the amount of the payment for a reasonable offset for use, the requirement that the consumer pay the reasonable offset for use in advance does not apply, and the manufacturer shall deduct that amount from the refund due to the consumer. If the consumer elects a replacement motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer a substitute motor vehicle to use until such time as the replacement vehicle is delivered to the consumer. At the time of the refund or replacement, the consumer, lienholder, or lessor shall furnish to the manufacturer clear title to and possession of the original motor vehicle.\n\nb. Refunds shall be made to the consumer and lienholder of record, if any, as their interests appear. If applicable, refunds shall be made to the lessor and lessee as follows: the lessee shall receive the lessee’s cost less a reasonable offset for use, and the lessor shall receive the lease price less the aggregate deposit and rental payments previously paid to the lessor for the leased vehicle. If it is determined that the lessee is entitled to a refund pursuant to this chapter, the consumer’s lease agreement with the lessor is terminated upon payment of the refund and no penalty for early termination shall be assessed. The department of revenue shall refund to the manufacturer any use tax or fee for new registration which the manufacturer refunded to the consumer, lessee, or lessor under this section, if the manufacturer provides to the department of revenue a written request for a refund and evidence that the use tax or fee for new registration was paid when the vehicle was purchased and that the manufacturer refunded the use tax or fee for new registration to the consumer, lessee, or lessor.\n\n3. a. It is presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to the warranty if, during the lemon law rights period, any of the following occur:\n\n(1) The same nonconformity that substantially impairs the motor vehicle has been subject to examination or repair at least three times by the manufacturer or its authorized service agent, plus a final attempt by the manufacturer to repair the motor vehicle if undertaken as provided for in subsection 1, and such nonconformity continues to exist.\n\n(2) A nonconformity that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury has been subject to examination or repair at least one time by the manufacturer or its authorized service agent, plus a final attempt by the manufacturer to repair the motor vehicle if undertaken as provided for in subsection 1, and such nonconformity continues to exist.\n\n(3) The motor vehicle has been out of service by reason of repair by the manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, of one or more nonconformities that substantially impair the motor vehicle for a cumulative total of thirty or more days, exclusive of down time for routine maintenance prescribed by the owner’s manual. The thirty-day period may be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of war, invasion, strike, fire, flood, or natural disaster.\n\nb. The terms of this subsection shall be extended for a period of up to two years after the date of the original delivery of a motor vehicle to a consumer, or the first twenty-four thousand miles of operation attributable to a consumer, whichever occurs first, if a nonconformity has been reported but has not been cured by the manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, before the expiration of the lemon law rights period.\n\n4. A manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, shall not refuse to examine or repair any nonconformity for the purpose of avoiding liability under this chapter.\n\n91 Acts, ch 153, §4; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2008 Acts, ch 1113, §107; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180\n\nReferred to in §321.105A, 322G.6, 322G.8, 322G.12",

At the time of the consumer’s purchase or lease of the vehicle, a manufacturer who has established a program certified pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum, clearly and conspicuously disclose to the consumer in written materials accompanying the vehicle how and where to file a claim with the program.\n\n2. A certified program shall be funded and competently staffed at a level sufficient to ensure fair and expeditious resolution of all disputes, and shall not charge consumers any fee for use of the program. The manufacturer shall take all steps necessary to ensure that a certified program and its staff and decision makers are sufficiently insulated from the manufacturer so that the performance of the staff and the decisions of the decision makers are not influenced by the manufacturer. Such steps, at a minimum, shall ensure that the manufacturer does not make decisions on whether a consumer’s dispute proceeds to the decision maker. Staff and decision makers of a certified program shall be trained in the provisions of this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter.\n\n3. a. A certified program shall allow an oral presentation by a party, or by a party’s employee, agent, or representative.\n\nb. Within five days following the consumer’s notification to the certified program of the dispute, the program shall inform each party of their right to make an oral presentation.\n\nc. Meetings of a certified program to hear and decide disputes shall be open to observers, including either party to the dispute, on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.\n\n4. A certified program shall render a decision no later than sixty days from the day of the consumer’s notification of the dispute, provided that a significant number of decisions are rendered within forty days. For the purposes of this section, notification is deemed to have occurred when a certified program has received the consumer’s name and address; the current date and the date of the original delivery of the motor vehicle to a consumer; the year, make, model, and identification number of the motor vehicle; and a description of the nonconformity. If the consumer has not previously notified the manufacturer of the nonconformity, the sixty-day period is extended for an additional seven days.\n\n5. A certified program shall, in rendering decisions, take into account the provisions of this chapter and all legal and equitable factors germane to a fair and just decision. The decision shall disclose to the consumer and the manufacturer the reasons for the decision, and the manufacturer’s required actions, if applicable. If the decision is in favor of the consumer, the consumer shall have up to twenty-five days from the date of receipt of the certified program’s decision to indicate acceptance of the decision. The decision shall prescribe a reasonable period of time, not to exceed thirty days from the date the consumer notifies the manufacturer of acceptance of the decision, within which the manufacturer must fulfill the terms of the decision. If the manufacturer has had a reasonable number of attempts to conform a motor vehicle to the warranty as set forth in section 322G.4, subsection 3, including a final attempt by the manufacturer to repair the motor vehicle, if undertaken as provided for in section 322G.4, subsection 1, and the consumer is entitled to a replacement vehicle or a refund under section 322G.4, subsection 2, the decision shall be limited to relief as allowed under section 322G.4, subsection 2. In an action brought by a consumer under this chapter, the decision of a certified program is admissible in evidence.\n\n6. A certified program shall establish written procedures which explain operation of the certified program. Copies of the written procedures shall be made available to any person upon request and shall be sent to the consumer upon notification of the dispute.\n\n7. A certified program shall retain all records for each dispute for at least four years after the final disposition of the dispute. A certified program shall have an independent audit conducted annually to determine whether the manufacturer and its performance and the program and its implementation are in compliance with this chapter. All records for each dispute shall be available for the audit. Such audit, upon completion, shall be forwarded to the attorney general.\n\n8. Any manufacturer licensed to sell motor vehicles in this state may apply to the attorney general for certification of its program. A manufacturer seeking certification of its program in this state shall submit to the attorney general an application for certification on a form prescribed by the attorney general.\n\n9. A program certified in this state or a program established by a manufacturer applying for certification in this state shall submit to the attorney general a copy of each settlement approved by the program or decision made by the decision maker within thirty days after the settlement is reached or the decision is rendered. The decision or settlement shall contain information prescribed by the attorney general.\n\n10. The attorney general shall review the operations of any certified program at least once annually. The attorney general shall prepare annual and periodic reports evaluating the operation of certified programs serving consumers in this state or programs established by motor vehicle manufacturers applying for certification in this state. The reports shall indicate whether certification should be granted, renewed, denied, or revoked.\n\n11. If a manufacturer has established a program which the attorney general has certified as substantially complying with the provisions of and the rules adopted under this chapter, and has informed the consumer how and where to file a claim with the program pursuant to subsection 1, the provisions of section 322G.4, subsection 2, do not apply to any consumer who has not first resorted to the program.\n\n91 Acts, ch 153, §6; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180\n\nReferred to in §322G.7, 322G.15",

If a consumer resorts to a manufacturer’s certified program and a decision is not rendered within the time periods allowed in this chapter, or a manufacturer has no certified program and the consumer has notified the manufacturer pursuant to section 322G.4, subsection 1, the consumer may file an action in district court under this chapter within one year from the expiration of the lemon law rights period or an extension of the period pursuant to section 322G.4, subsection 3.\n\n2. If a consumer resorts to a manufacturer’s certified program and is not satisfied with the performance of the manufacturer as ordered in the decision, or the manufacturer does not perform as directed by the decision within the time period specified in the decision, the consumer may file an action in district court under this chapter within six months after the date prescribed in the decision by which the manufacturer must fulfill the terms of the decision. If the consumer declines to accept the decision of the manufacturer’s certified program, the consumer may appeal the decision pursuant to subsection 4. For purposes of this subsection, “not satisfied with the performance of the decision” means, following the consumer’s acceptance of the decision, the consumer indicates that the manufacturer failed to comply with the terms of the decision within the time specified in the decision or failed to cure the nonconformity within the time specified in the decision if further repairs were ordered.\n\n3. In an action under either subsection 1 or 2, the court shall award a consumer who prevails the amount of any pecuniary loss, including relief the consumer is entitled to under section 322G.4, subsection 2, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs. In addition, if the court affirms the decision of the certified program, the court may award any additional amounts allowed under subsection 7.\n\n4. A certified program’s decision is final unless appealed by either party. A petition to the district court to appeal a decision must be made within fifty days after receipt of the decision or within twenty-five days from the date the consumer indicates acceptance of the decision to the manufacturer, whichever occurs first. Within seven days after the petition has been filed, the appealing party must send, by certified, registered, or express mail, a copy of the petition to the attorney general. If the attorney general receives no notice of the petition within sixty days after the manufacturer’s receipt of a decision in favor of the consumer, and the consumer has indicated acceptance of the decision within the twenty-five days of receipt of the decision, but the manufacturer has neither complied with, nor petitioned to appeal the decision, the attorney general may apply to the court to impose a fine up to one thousand dollars per day against the manufacturer until the amount stands at twice the purchase price of the motor vehicle, unless the manufacturer provides clear and convincing evidence that the delay or failure was beyond its control or was acceptable to the consumer as evidenced by a written statement signed by the consumer. If the manufacturer fails to provide such evidence or fails to pay the fine, the attorney general shall initiate proceedings against the manufacturer for failure to pay the fine. The proceeds from the fine imposed shall be placed in the attorney general’s motor vehicle fraud and odometer law enforcement fund for implementation and enforcement of this chapter.\n\n5. If the manufacturer fails to comply with a decision which has been timely accepted by the consumer or fails to file a timely petition for appeal, the court shall affirm the board’s decision upon application by the consumer.\n\n6. An appeal of a decision by a certified program to the court by a consumer or a manufacturer shall be tried de novo, and may be based upon stipulated facts. In a written petition to appeal a decision by the board, the appealing party must state the action requested and the grounds relied upon for appeal.\n\n7. If a decision of the certified program in favor of the consumer is affirmed or upheld by the court, recovery by the consumer shall include the pecuniary value of the award, including relief the consumer is entitled to under section 322G.4, subsection 2, attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining confirmation of the award, and all costs and continuing damages in an amount of twenty-five dollars per day for all days beyond the twenty-five-day period following the manufacturer’s receipt of the consumer’s acceptance of the certified program’s decision. If a court determines that a manufacturer filed a petition for appeal to be tried de novo in bad faith or brought such an appeal solely for the purpose of harassment, the court shall double, and may triple, the amount of the total award, after consideration of all circumstances.\n\n8. Appellate review of a court decision in favor of the consumer may be conditioned upon payment by the manufacturer of the consumer’s attorney’s fees and giving security for costs and expenses resulting from the review period.\n\n9.

A dealer shall not be made a party defendant in any action involving or relating to this chapter, except as provided in this section. The manufacturer shall not charge back or require reimbursement by the dealer for any costs, including but not limited to any refunds or vehicle replacements, incurred by the manufacturer pursuant to this chapter, in the absence of a finding by a court that the related repairs had been carried out by the dealer in a manner substantially inconsistent with the manufacturer’s published instructions. A manufacturer who is found by a court to have improperly charged back a dealer because of a violation of this section is liable to the injured dealer for full reimbursement plus reasonable costs and any attorney’s fees.\n\n91 Acts, ch 153, §11; 95 Acts, ch 45, §7",

A manufacturer who accepts the return of a motor vehicle pursuant to a settlement, determination, or decision under this chapter shall notify the state department of transportation, report the vehicle identification number of that motor vehicle within ten days after the acceptance, and obtain a new certificate of title for the vehicle in the manufacturer’s name pursuant to section 321.46. In obtaining a new certificate of title, the manufacturer shall title the vehicle in the county of the transferor’s residence and shall be exempt from the registration fee requirements of section 321.46 and the fee for new registration under section 321.105A. The new certificate of title, and all subsequent registration receipts and certificates of title issued for the motor vehicle, shall contain a designation indicating that the motor vehicle was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to this chapter or a similar law of another state. The state department of transportation shall determine the manner in which the designation is to be indicated on registration receipts and certificates of title and may determine that a “REBUILT” or “SALVAGE” designation supersedes the designation required by this subsection and include the “REBUILT” or “SALVAGE” designation on the registration receipt and certificate of title in lieu of the designation required by this subsection.\n\n2. A person shall not knowingly lease, sell, either at wholesale or retail, or transfer a title to a motor vehicle returned by reason of a settlement, determination, or decision pursuant to this chapter or a similar law of another state unless the nature of the nonconformity is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the prospective transferee, lessee, or buyer. The attorney general shall prescribe by rule the form, content, and procedure pertaining to such a disclosure statement, recognizing the need of manufacturers to implement a uniform disclosure form. The manufacturer shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that such disclosure is made to the first subsequent retail buyer or lessee. For purposes of this section,“settlement” includes an agreement entered into between the manufacturer and the consumer that occurs after the thirtieth day following the manufacturer’s receipt of the consumer’s written notification pursuant to section 322G.4.\n\n91 Acts, ch 153, §12; 95 Acts, ch 45, §8; 2000 Acts, ch 1047, §3, 4; 2008 Acts, ch 1113, §108; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §44\n\nReferred to in §312.2, 321.46, 321.105A, 322G.11",
