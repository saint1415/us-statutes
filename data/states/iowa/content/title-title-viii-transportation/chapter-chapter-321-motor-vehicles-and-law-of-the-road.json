The purpose of the physical inspection under this section is not to determine whether the motor vehicle is in a condition safe to operate.\n\nc. The owner of a specially constructed vehicle, reconstructed vehicle, street rod, or replica vehicle shall apply for a certificate of title and registration for the vehicle at the county treasurer’s office within thirty days of the inspection. For a foreign vehicle which has been registered outside this state, the owner shall surrender to the treasurer all registration plates, registration cards, and certificates of title, or if the vehicle to be registered is from a nontitle state, the evidence of foreign registration and ownership as may be prescribed by the department except as provided in subsection 2.\n\nd.

In the event an applicant for registration of a foreign vehicle for which a certificate of title has been issued is able to furnish evidence of being the registered owner of the vehicle to the county treasurer of the owner’s residence, although unable to surrender such certificate of title, the county treasurer may issue a registration receipt and plates upon receipt of the required annual registration fee and the fee for new registration but shall not issue a certificate of title thereto. Upon surrender of the certificate of title from the foreign state, the county treasurer shall issue a certificate of title to the owner, or person entitled thereto, of such vehicle as provided in this chapter. The owner of a vehicle registered under this subsection shall not be required to obtain a certificate of title in this state and may transfer ownership of the vehicle to a motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 322 or an insurance carrier authorized to do business in this state if, at the time of the transfer, the certificate of title is held by a secured party and the dealer or insurance carrier, as applicable, has forwarded to the secured party the sum necessary to discharge the security interest pursuant to section 321.48, subsection 1.\n\n4.

If the prior certificate of title is from another state and indicates that the vehicle was rebuilt, the new certificate of title and registration receipt shall contain the designation “REBUILT” printed on its face together with the name of the state issuing the prior title. The designation shall be retained on the face of all subsequent certificates of title and registration receipts for the vehicle.\n\n5. If the prior certificate of title is from another state and indicates that the vehicle was junked, an Iowa junking certificate shall be issued according to section 321.52, subsections 2 and 3. If the prior certificate of title from another state indicates that the vehicle is salvaged and not rebuilt or is a salvage certificate of title, an Iowa salvage certificate of title shall be issued and a “SALVAGE” designation shall be retained on all subsequent Iowa certificates of title and registration receipts for the vehicle, unless the owner has surrendered the prior certificate of title and a salvage theft examination certificate, as provided under section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “c”, and the salvage theft examination certificate was properly executed within thirty days of the date the owner was assigned the prior certificate of title. The department may require that subsequent Iowa certificates of title retain other states’ designations which indicate that a vehicle had incurred prior damage. The department shall determine the manner in which other states’ rebuilt, salvage, or other designations are to be indicated on Iowa titles.\n\n6.

Except for a vehicle registered under chapter 326, a vehicle registered for the first time during the eleventh month of the owner’s registration year may be registered for the remaining unexpired months of the registration year as provided in this subsection or for the remaining unexpired months of the registration year and for the next registration year, upon payment of the applicable registration fees.\n\n11. If the county treasurer or department is not satisfied as to the ownership of the vehicle or that there are no undisclosed security interests in it, or a junking certificate has been issued for the vehicle but a certificate of title will not be reissued under section 321.52, subsection 3, and the vehicle qualifies as an antique vehicle under section 321.115, subsection 1, the county treasurer or department may register the vehicle but shall, as a condition of issuing a certificate of title and registration receipt, require the applicant to file with the department a bond in the form prescribed by the department and executed by the applicant, and either accompanied by the deposit of cash with the department or also executed by a person authorized to conduct a surety business in this state. The owner of a vehicle subject to the bond requirements of this subsection shall apply for a certificate of title and registration for the vehicle at the county treasurer’s office within thirty days of issuance of written authorization from the department. The bond shall be in an amount equal to one and one-half times the current value of the vehicle as determined by the department and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and secured party and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or person acquiring any security interest in it, and their respective successors in interest, against any expense, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorney fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificate of title for the vehicle or on account of any defect in or undisclosed security interest upon the right, title, and interest of the applicant in and to the vehicle. Any such interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons shall not exceed the amount of the bond. The bond, and any deposit accompanying it, shall be returned at the end of three years or earlier if the vehicle is no longer registered in this state and the currently valid certificate of title is surrendered to the department, unless the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond. The department may authorize issuance of a certificate of title as provided in this subsection for a vehicle with an unreleased security interest upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the security interest has been extinguished or that the holder of the security interest cannot be located to release the security interest as provided in section 321.50.\n\n12.

The application shall be signed by the owner or lienholder and accompanied by a fee of twenty dollars.\n\nb. After five days, the department or county treasurer shall issue a replacement copy using the applicant’s most recent bona fide address; however, the five-day waiting period does not apply to an applicant who is a lienholder or to an applicant who has surrendered the original certificate of title to the department or county treasurer. The replacement copy shall be clearly marked “replacement” and shall include security interests and liens. When a replacement copy has been issued, the previous certificate is void. The department or county treasurer is not authorized to refund fees collected for a replacement title under this section or section 321.52A.\n\nc. If a security interest noted on the face of an original certificate of title was released by the lienholder on a separate form pursuant to section 321.50, subsection 5, and the signature of the lienholder, or the person executing the release on behalf of the lienholder, is notarized, but the lienholder has not delivered the original certificate to the appropriate party as provided in section 321.50, subsection 5, the owner may apply for and receive a replacement certificate of title without the released security interest noted thereon. The lienholder shall return the original certificate of title to the department or to the treasurer of the county where the title was issued.\n\nd. A new purchaser or transferee is entitled to receive an original title upon presenting the assigned replacement copy to the treasurer of the county where the new purchaser or transferee resides. At the time of purchase, a purchaser may require the seller to indemnify the purchaser and all future purchasers of the vehicle against any loss which may be suffered due to claims on the original certificate. A person recovering an original certificate of title for which a replacement has been issued shall surrender the original certificate to the county treasurer or the department.\n\n3. If a county treasurer mails vehicle registration documents which become lost or are damaged in transit through the United States postal service, the person to whom the documents were being sent may apply for reissuance without cost. The application shall be made with the county treasurer who originally issued the documents not less than twenty days from the date the documents were placed with the United States postal service. If the original documents are received after reissuance of duplicates, the original documents shall be surrendered to the county treasurer within five days of the time they are received.\n\n[SS15, §1571-m5; C24, 27, 31, 35, §4886; C39, §5001.26; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, S81, §321.42; 81 Acts, ch 102, §1]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1305, §51; 85 Acts, ch 209, §1; 99 Acts, ch 13, §6; 2000 Acts, ch 1016, §43, 47; 2004 Acts, ch 1013, §11, 35; 2005 Acts, ch 34, §4, 26; 2006 Acts, ch 1068, §11; 2008 Acts, ch 1113, §16, 21; 2008 Acts, ch 1124, §6\n\nReferred to in §312.2, 321.52A, 331.557, 648.22A\n\nSurcharge imposed; §321.52A",

The transferee purchases the vehicle at retail for the purpose of modifying the vehicle as provided in section 321.105A, subsection 2, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (31), prior to selling it as a used vehicle to a business or government entity.\n\nc. The transferee operates the vehicle only for purposes incidental to a resale.\n\nd. The transferee displays a dealer plate on the vehicle or does not drive the vehicle or permit it to be driven upon the highways.\n\n6.

      "text": "321.50 Security interest provisions.\n\n1. A security interest in a vehicle subject to registration under the laws of this state or a mobile home or manufactured home, except trailers whose empty weight is two thousand pounds or less, and except new or used vehicles held by a dealer or manufacturer as inventory for sale, is perfected by the delivery to the county treasurer of the county where the certificate of title was issued or, in the case of a new certificate, to the county treasurer where the certificate will be issued, of an application for certificate of title which lists the security interest, or an application for notation of security interest signed by the owner or by one owner of a vehicle owned jointly by more than one person, or signed through electronic means as determined by the department, or a certificate of title from another jurisdiction which shows the security interest, and payment of a fee of ten dollars for each security interest shown. The department shall require the federal employer identification number of a secured party who is a firm, association, or corporation or, if a natural person, the social security number. Upon delivery of the application and payment of the fee, the county treasurer shall note the date of delivery on the application. If the delivery is by electronic means and the time is electronically recorded on the application along with the date, the time shall be included with the date on all subsequent documents and records where the date of perfection is required under this chapter. The date of delivery shall be the date of perfection of the security interest in the vehicle, regardless of the date the security interest is noted on the certificate of title. Up to three security interests may be perfected against a vehicle and shown on an Iowa certificate of title. If the owner or secured party is in possession of the certificate of title, it must also be delivered at this time. If a vehicle is subject to a security interest when brought into this state, the validity of the security interest and the date of perfection is determined by section 554.9303. Delivery as provided in this subsection constitutes perfection of a security interest on a certificate of title for purposes of this chapter and chapter 554.\n\n2. Upon receipt of the application and the required fee, if the certificate of title was not delivered to the county treasurer along with the application, the county treasurer shall notify the holder of the certificate of title to deliver to the county treasurer, within five days from the receipt of notice, the certificate of title to permit notation of the security interest. If the holder of the certificate of title fails to deliver it within five days, the holder shall be liable to anyone harmed by the holder’s failure.\n\n3. Upon receipt of the application, the certificate of title, if any, and the required fee, the county treasurer shall note the security interest and the date of perfection of the security interest on the certificate of title. The county treasurer shall also note the security interest and the date of perfection of the security interest in the county records system. Upon receipt of a certificate of title issued by a foreign jurisdiction, on which a security interest has been noted, the county treasurer shall note the security interest and the date the security interest was noted on the foreign certificate of title, if available, or if not, the date of issuance of the foreign certificate of title, on the face of the new certificate of title. The county treasurer shall also note the security interest and the date that was noted on the certificate of title in the county records system. The county treasurer shall then deliver the certificate of title to the first secured party as shown thereon.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if a security interest has been delivered by electronic means, the county treasurer or department shall not print a certificate of title until all security interests have been released, but shall provide the first security interest holder with an electronic record of the certificate of title. When a vehicle is subject to an electronic lien, the certificate of title for the vehicle shall be considered to be physically held by the lienholder for purposes of compliance with odometer disclosure requirements under section 321.71.\n\n5. a. Except as provided in section 321.48, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, when a security interest is discharged, the holder shall note a cancellation of the security interest on the face of the certificate of title over the holder’s signature or may note the cancellation of the security interest on a separate, notarized release form or letter. The holder shall deliver the certificate of title and the form or letter, if applicable, to the county treasurer where the title was issued. In the case of a security interest that has been delivered by electronic means, the holder shall notify the department or the county treasurer, in a manner prescribed by the department, of the release of the security interest. The county treasurer shall immediately note the cancellation of the security interest on the face of the certificate of title, if applicable, and in the county records system. The county treasurer shall on the same day deliver the certificate of title, if applicable, and the separate, notarized release form or letter, if applicable, to the then first secured party or, if there is no such person, to the person as directed by the owner, in writing, on a form prescribed by the department or, if there is no person designated, then to the owner. The cancellation of the security interest shall be noted on the certificate of title by the county treasurer without charge. The holder of a security interest discharged by payment who fails to release the security interest within fifteen days after being requested in writing to do so shall forfeit to the person making the payment the sum of twenty-five dollars.\n\nb. If a lien has been released by the lienholder but has not been sent to the county of record for clearance of the lien, any county may note the release on the face of the title and shall notify the county of record that the lien has been released as of the specified date and make entry upon the computer system. Notification to the county of record shall be made by an automated statewide system or by sending a photocopy of the released title to the county of record.\n\nc. When a security interest is discharged, the lienholder shall note the cancellation of the security interest on the face of the title and, if applicable, may note the cancellation of the security interest on a form prescribed by the department and deliver a copy of the form in lieu of the title to the department or to the treasurer of the county in which the title was issued. The form may be delivered by electronic means. The department or county treasurer shall note the release of the security interest upon the statewide computer system and the county’s records. A copy of the form, if used, shall be attached to the title by the lienholder, if the title is held by the lienholder, and shall be evidence of the release of the security interest. If the title is held by the lienholder, the lienholder shall deliver the title to the first lienholder, or if there is no such person, to the person as designated by the owner, or if there is no such person designated, to the owner. If a certificate of title has not been issued, upon release of a security interest, the lienholder shall notify the department or the county treasurer, in a manner prescribed by the department, of the release of the security interest.\n\nd. For purposes of this subsection, a security interest noted on an Iowa certificate of title and appearing in the statewide computer system and the county’s records shall be presumed to be discharged upon presentation of a valid certificate of title subsequently issued by a foreign jurisdiction on which the security interest is no longer noted.\n\n6. Notwithstanding subsection 5, when an application for registration and issuance of a certificate of title is made by the means described in section 321.20, subsection 2, and the application includes a certificate of title upon which a security interest has been discharged by the secured party and the cancellation of the security interest is noted by the secured party on the certificate of title above the secured party’s signature, the county treasurer shall not require any other notation of the cancellation of the security interest on the face of the certificate of title, and, if applicable, the county treasurer shall notify the county treasurer of the county where the certificate of title was issued that the security interest has been released as of the specified date and shall update such release on the applicable program or computer system. A dealer licensed under chapter 322 or chapter 322C is authorized to sell such a vehicle pursuant to section 321.48, subsection 1, paragraph “b”.\n\n7. The uniform commercial code, chapter 554, article 9, shall apply to all transactions intended to create a security interest in vehicles except as provided in this chapter.\n\n8. Upon request of any person, the county treasurer shall certify whether there are, on the date and hour stated therein, any security interests or liens against a vehicle and the name and address of each secured party. The uniform fee for a certification shall be two dollars if the request for the certification is on a form conforming to standards prescribed by the secretary of state; otherwise, three dollars. Upon request and payment of the appropriate fee, the county treasurer shall furnish a certified copy of any security interests for a uniform fee of one dollar per page.\n\n[C24, 27, 31, 35, §4967; C39, §5002.06; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321.50]\n\n83 Acts, ch 5, §3, 5; 84 Acts, ch 1305, §55; 89 Acts, ch 260, §3; 92 Acts, ch 1175, §30; 97 Acts, ch 108, §6; 99 Acts, ch 13, §9; 99 Acts, ch 188, §10; 2000 Acts, ch 1016, §7, 44, 47; 2000 Acts, ch 1149, §166, 187; 2001 Acts, ch 153, §17; 2003 Acts, ch 8, §13; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1013, §15 – 17, 35; 2004 Acts, ch 1092, §3; 2014 Acts, ch 1123, §11; 2018 Acts, ch 1034, §1; 2023 Acts, ch 50, §1, 2\n\nReferred to in §321.24, 321.42, 321.45, 321.48, 321.131, 331.557\n\nSubsection 5, paragraph a amended\n\nNEW subsection 6 and former subsections 6 and 7 renumbered as 7 and 8",

When a vehicle is sold outside the state for purposes other than for junk, the owner, dealer or otherwise, shall detach the registration plates and registration card and shall indicate on the registration card the name and address of the foreign purchaser or transferee over the person’s signature. Unless the registration plates are legally attached to another vehicle, the owner shall surrender the registration plates and registration card to the county treasurer, who shall cancel the records, destroy the registration plates, and forward the registration card to the department. The department shall make a notation on the records of the out-of-state sale and, after a reasonable period, may destroy the files for that particular vehicle. The department is not authorized to make a refund of annual registration fees on a vehicle sold out of state unless it receives the registration card completed as provided in this section.\n\n2. a. The purchaser or transferee of a motor vehicle subject to registration for which a certificate of title is issued which is sold for scrap or junk shall surrender the certificate of title, properly endorsed and signed by the previous owner, to the county treasurer of the county of residence of the transferee, and shall apply for a junking certificate from the county treasurer, within thirty days after assignment of the certificate of title, except when the vehicle is disposed of pursuant to paragraph “b”. The county treasurer shall issue to such person without fee a junking certificate. A junking certificate shall authorize the holder to possess, transport, or transfer by endorsement the ownership of the junked vehicle. A certificate of title shall not again be issued for the vehicle subsequent to the issuance of a junking certificate except as provided in subsection 3. The county treasurer shall cancel the record of the vehicle. The junking certificate shall be printed on the registration receipt form and shall be imprinted with the words “junking certificate”, as prescribed by the department. A space for transfer by endorsement shall be on the junking certificate. A separate form for the notation of the transfer of component parts shall be attached to the junking certificate when the certificate is issued.\n\nb. The owner of a motor vehicle subject to registration that does not have a certificate of title or a junking certificate may dispose of the vehicle to a vehicle recycler licensed under chapter 321H for scrap or junk if the vehicle is twelve model years old or older and is acquired by the vehicle recycler for reasonable consideration equaling less than one thousand dollars.\n\n3. a. When a vehicle for which a certificate of title is issued is junked or dismantled by the owner, the owner shall detach the registration plates and surrender the plates to the county treasurer, unless the plates are properly assigned to another vehicle. The owner shall also surrender the certificate of title to the county treasurer, except when the vehicle is disposed of pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “b”.\n\nb. Upon the surrender of the certificate of title and application for junking certificate, the county treasurer shall issue to the person, without fee, a junking certificate, which shall authorize the holder to possess, transport, or transfer ownership of the junked vehicle by endorsement of the junking certificate. The county treasurer shall hold the surrendered certificate of title, registration receipt, application for junking certificate, and, if applicable, the registration plates for a period of fourteen days following the issuance of a junking certificate under this subsection.\n\nc. Within the fourteen-day period, the person who was issued the junking certificate and to whom the vehicle was titled or assigned may surrender to the county treasurer the junking certificate, and upon the person’s payment of appropriate fees and taxes and payment of any credit for annual registration fees received by the person for the vehicle under section 321.46, subsection 3, the county treasurer shall issue to the person a certificate of title for the vehicle. After the expiration of the fourteen-day period, a county treasurer shall not issue a certificate of title for a junked vehicle for which a junking certificate is issued. The county treasurer shall cancel the record of the vehicle and forward the certificate of title to the department.\n\nd. However, upon application and a showing of good cause, the department may issue a certificate of title to a person after the fourteen-day period for a junked vehicle for which a junking certificate has been issued. For purposes of this subsection, “good cause” means that the junking certificate was obtained by mistake or inadvertence. If a person’s application to the department is denied, the person may make application for a certificate of title under the bonding procedure as provided in section 321.24, if the vehicle qualifies as an antique vehicle under section 321.115, subsection 1, or the person may seek judicial review as provided under sections 17A.19 and 17A.20.\n\n4. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an insurer may apply for and be issued a salvage certificate of title for a motor vehicle without surrendering the certificate of title or manufacturer’s or importer’s statement of origin properly assigned if ownership of the vehicle was transferred, or will transfer, to the insurer pursuant to a settlement with the previous owner of the vehicle arising from circumstances involving damage to the vehicle, and at least thirty days have expired since the effective date of such settlement. To obtain a salvage certificate of title pursuant to this paragraph “a”, the insurer shall submit an application for a salvage certificate of title to the county treasurer of the county in which the vehicle is stored by or on behalf of the insurer. The application shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the insurer in which the insurer certifies it has made at least two written attempts to obtain a properly assigned certificate of title or manufacturer’s or importer’s statement of origin for the vehicle by contacting the previous owner of the vehicle and all lienholders of record by certified mail or a similar service that provides proof of service using a return receipt, and has been unable to obtain the title or statement of origin. The failure of a previous owner or lienholder to provide a properly assigned certificate of title or manufacturer’s or importer’s statement of origin shall be deemed to be a waiver by the previous owner or lienholder of all rights, title, claim, and interest in the vehicle. The application shall also be accompanied by the application fee required under paragraph “b”, and proof of payment of the total amount of the settlement by the insurer to the previous owner of the vehicle. Upon receiving an application that complies with this paragraph “a”, the county treasurer shall issue a salvage certificate of title to the insurer which shall be free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership and shall bear the word “SALVAGE” stamped or printed on the face of the title in a manner prescribed by the department.\n\nb. A vehicle rebuilder or a person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or exchanging vehicles of a type required to be registered in this state, upon acquisition of a wrecked or salvage vehicle, shall surrender the certificate of title or manufacturer’s or importer’s statement of origin properly assigned, together with an application for a salvage certificate of title, to the county treasurer of the county of residence of the purchaser or transferee within thirty days after the date of assignment of the certificate of title for the wrecked or salvage motor vehicle. This subsection applies only to vehicles with a fair market value of five hundred dollars or more, based on the value before the vehicle became wrecked or salvage. Upon payment of a fee of ten dollars, the county treasurer shall issue a salvage certificate of title which shall bear the word “SALVAGE” stamped or printed on the face of the title in a manner prescribed by the department. A salvage certificate of title may be assigned to an educational institution, a new motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 322, a person engaged in the business of purchasing bodies, parts of bodies, frames or component parts of vehicles for sale as scrap metal, a salvage pool, or an authorized vehicle recycler licensed under chapter 321H. An authorized vehicle recycler licensed under chapter 321H or a new motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 322 may assign or reassign an Iowa salvage certificate of title or a salvage certificate of title from another state to any person, and the provisions of section 321.24, subsection 5, requiring issuance of an Iowa salvage certificate of title shall not apply. A vehicle on which ownership has transferred to an insurer of the vehicle as a result of a settlement with the owner of the vehicle arising out of damage to, or unrecovered theft of, the vehicle shall be deemed to be a wrecked or salvage vehicle and the insurer shall comply with this subsection to obtain a salvage certificate of title within thirty days after the date of assignment of the certificate of title of the vehicle.\n\nc. When a wrecked or salvage vehicle has been repaired, the owner may apply for a regular certificate of title by paying the appropriate fees and surrendering the salvage certificate of title and a properly executed salvage theft examination certificate. A motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of thirty thousand pounds or more is not subject to the salvage theft examination otherwise required under paragraph “d”, and the owner of such vehicle is not required to submit a salvage theft examination certificate. The county treasurer shall issue a regular certificate of title which shall bear a designation printed on the face of the title and printed on the registration receipt indicating that the vehicle was previously titled on a salvage certificate of title in a form approved by the department. This designation shall be included on every Iowa certificate of title and registration receipt issued thereafter for the vehicle. However, if ownership of a stolen vehicle has been transferred to an insurer organized under the laws of this state or admitted to do business in this state, or if the transfer was the result of a settlement with the owner of the vehicle arising from damage to or the unrecovered theft of the vehicle, and if the insurer certifies to the county treasurer on a form approved by the department that the insurance company has received one or more written estimates which state that the retail cost of repairs including labor, parts, and other materials of all damage to the vehicle is less than three thousand dollars, the county treasurer shall issue to the insurance company the regular certificate of title and registration receipt without this designation.\n\nd. A salvage theft examination shall be made by a peace officer who has been specially certified and recertified when required by the Iowa law enforcement academy to do salvage theft examinations. The Iowa law enforcement academy shall determine standards for training and certification, conduct training, and may approve alternative training programs which satisfy the academy’s standards for training and certification. The owner of the salvage vehicle shall make the vehicle available for examination at a time and location designated by the peace officer doing the examination. The owner may obtain a permit to drive the vehicle to and from the examination location by submitting a repair affidavit to the agency performing the examination stating that the vehicle is reasonably safe for operation and listing the repairs which have been made to the vehicle. The owner must be present for the examination and have available for inspection the salvage title, bills of sale for all essential parts changed, if applicable, and the repair affidavit. The examination shall be for the purposes of determining whether the vehicle or repair components have been stolen. The examination is not a safety inspection and a signed salvage theft examination certificate shall not be construed by any court of law to be a certification that the vehicle is safe to be operated. There shall be no cause of action against the peace officer or the agency conducting the examination or the county treasurer for failure to discover or note safety defects. If the vehicle passes the theft examination, the peace officer shall indicate that the vehicle passed examination on the salvage theft examination certificate. The permit and salvage theft examination certificate shall be on controlled forms prescribed and furnished by the department. The owner shall pay a fee of fifty dollars at the time the examination is scheduled. The agency performing the examinations shall retain forty dollars of the fee and shall pay five dollars of the fee to the department and five dollars of the fee to the treasurer of state for deposit in the general fund of the state. Moneys deposited to the general fund under this paragraph are subject to the requirements of section 8.60 and shall be used by the Iowa law enforcement academy to provide for the special training, certification, and recertification of officers as required by this subsection.\n\ne. For purposes of this subsection, “wrecked or salvage vehicle” means a damaged motor vehicle subject to registration for which the cost of repair exceeds seventy percent of the fair market value of the vehicle, as determined in accordance with rules adopted by the department, before the vehicle became damaged.\n\n5. The department shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 17A to carry out this section.\n\n[C24, 27, 31, 35, §4887; C39, §5002.08; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321.52; 81 Acts, ch 102, §3]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1169, §2; 84 Acts, ch 1305, §56; 85 Acts, ch 67, §36; 85 Acts, ch 209, §3; 88 Acts, ch 1089, §4 – 6; 88 Acts, ch 1215, §8 – 10; 89 Acts, ch 185, §3; 89 Acts, ch 296, §28; 91 Acts, ch 142, §2, 3; 91 Acts, ch 260, §1225, 1226; 92 Acts, ch 1104, §3; 93 Acts, ch 131, §12; 94 Acts, ch 1107, §51; 95 Acts, ch 45, §2, 3; 97 Acts, ch 108, §7; 97 Acts, ch 121, §2; 2000 Acts, ch 1016, §8, 9; 2005 Acts, ch 8, §11; 2006 Acts, ch 1068, §14; 2006 Acts, ch 1070, §7; 2006 Acts, ch 1120, §12; 2007 Acts, ch 143, §10; 2008 Acts, ch 1018, §17, 18; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §47, 48; 2008 Acts, ch 1113, §19, 21, 82; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §114; 2015 Acts, ch 52, §3, 4, 14; 2016 Acts, ch 1098, §32; 2017 Acts, ch 31, §2; 2021 Acts, ch 30, §1\n\nReferred to in §312.2, 321.1, 321.24, 321.45, 321.46, 321.47, 321.49, 321.52A, 321.67, 321.69, 321.100, 321.104, 321.126, 322C.6, 331.557, 805.8A(2)(m)\n\nSurcharge imposed; §321.52A\n\nFor applicable scheduled fine, see §805.8A, subsection 2",

A certificate of title shall not be issued for a motor vehicle unless a damage disclosure statement has been made by the transferor of the vehicle and is furnished with the application for certificate of title. A damage disclosure statement shall be provided by the transferor to the transferee in a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle. The new certificate of title and registration receipt shall state on the face whether a prior owner had disclosed that the vehicle was damaged to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”.\n\n2. The damage disclosure statement required by this section shall, at a minimum, state whether the transferor knows if the vehicle was titled as a salvage, rebuilt, or flood vehicle in this or any other state prior to the transferor’s ownership of the vehicle and, if not, whether the transferor knows if the vehicle was damaged to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”, during or prior to the transferor’s ownership of the vehicle.\n\n3. The damage disclosure statement shall be provided by the transferor to the transferee at or before the time of sale. If the transferor is not a resident of this state or if the transferee acquired the vehicle by operation of law as provided in section 321.47, the transferee shall not be required to submit a damage disclosure statement from the transferor with the transferee’s application for title unless the state of the transferor’s residence requires a damage disclosure statement. However, the transferee shall submit a damage disclosure statement with the transferee’s application for title indicating whether a salvage, rebuilt, or flood title had ever existed for the vehicle, and if not, whether the vehicle was damaged to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”, during or prior to the transferor’s ownership of the vehicle, and the year, make, and vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle. The transferee shall not be required to indicate whether the vehicle was damaged to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”, under this subsection if the transferor’s certificate of title is from another state and if it indicates that the vehicle is salvaged and not rebuilt or is another state’s salvage certificate of title.\n\n4. A lessee who has executed a lease as defined in section 321F.1 shall provide a damage disclosure statement to the lessor at the termination of the lease. The damage disclosure statement shall be made on a separate disclosure document and shall state whether the vehicle was damaged during the term of the lease to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”. The lessee’s damage disclosure statement shall not be submitted with the application for title, but the lessor shall retain the lessee’s damage disclosure statement for five years following the date of the statement.\n\n5. The department shall retain each damage disclosure statement received and copies shall be available to the public and the attorney general upon request.\n\n6. Authorized vehicle recyclers licensed under chapter 321H and motor vehicle dealers licensed under chapter 322 shall maintain copies of all damage disclosure statements where the recycler or dealer is either the transferor or the transferee for five years following the date of the statement. The copies shall be made available to the department or the attorney general upon request.\n\n7. a. The damage disclosure statements shall be made on the back of the certificate of title if the title is available to the transferor at the time of sale. If the title is not available at the time of sale or if the face of the transferor’s Iowa title contains no indication that the vehicle was previously salvaged or titled as a salvage, rebuilt, or flood vehicle and the transferor knows or reasonably should know that the vehicle was previously salvaged or titled as a salvage, rebuilt, or flood vehicle in another state, the transferor shall make the disclosure on a separate disclosure document. The damage disclosure statement forms shall be as approved by the department. The treasurer shall not accept a damage disclosure statement and issue a title unless the back of the title or separate disclosure document has been fully completed and signed and dated by the transferee and the transferor, if applicable. If a separate damage disclosure document from a prior owner is required to be furnished with the application for title, the transferor shall provide a copy of the separate damage disclosure document to the transferee at or before the time of sale.\n\nb. In addition to the information required in subsection 2, a separate disclosure document shall state whether the vehicle’s certificate of title indicates the existence of damage prior to the period of the transferor’s ownership of the vehicle and whether the vehicle was titled as a salvage, rebuilt, or flood vehicle during the period of the transferor’s ownership of the vehicle.\n\n8. A person, authorized vehicle recycler licensed under chapter 321H, or motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 322 shall not be liable to a subsequent owner, driver, or passenger of a vehicle because a prior owner or lessee gave a false or inaccurate damage disclosure statement or failed to disclose that the vehicle had previously been damaged and repaired or had been titled on a salvage, rebuilt, or flood certificate of title unless the person, recycler, or dealer knew or reasonably should have known that the prior owner or lessee gave a false or inaccurate damage disclosure statement or failed to disclose that the vehicle had been damaged and repaired or had been titled on a salvage, rebuilt, or flood certificate of title.\n\n9. Except for subsections 10 and 11, this section does not apply to motor trucks and truck tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating of sixteen thousand pounds or more, vehicles more than seven model years old, autocycles, motorcycles, motorized bicycles, and special mobile equipment. This section does apply to motor homes. The requirement in subsection 1 that the new certificate of title and registration receipt shall state on the face whether a prior owner had disclosed that the vehicle was damaged to the extent that it was a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined in section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “e”, does not apply to a vehicle with a certificate of title bearing a designation that the vehicle was previously titled on a salvage certificate of title pursuant to section 321.52, subsection 4, paragraph “c”, or to a vehicle with a certificate of title bearing a “REBUILT” or “SALVAGE” designation pursuant to section 321.24, subsection 4 or 5. Except for subsections 10 and 11, this section does not apply to new motor vehicles with a true mileage, as defined in section 321.71, of one thousand miles or less, unless such vehicle has incurred damage as described in subsection 2.\n\n10. a. A person shall not sell, lease, or trade a motor vehicle if the person knows or reasonably should know that the motor vehicle contains a nonoperative air bag that is part of an inflatable restraint system, or that the motor vehicle has had an air bag removed and not replaced, unless the person clearly discloses, in writing, to the person to whom the person is selling, leasing, or trading the vehicle, prior to the sale, lease, or trade, that the air bag is missing or nonoperative. In addition, a lessee who has executed a lease as defined in section 321F.1 shall provide the disclosure statement required in this subsection to the lessor upon termination of the lease.\n\nb. The written disclosure required by this subsection shall be deemed to be a damage disclosure statement for the purposes of subsections 6, 8, and 11.\n\n11. A person who knowingly makes a false damage disclosure statement or fails to make a damage disclosure statement required by this section commits a fraudulent practice. Failure of a person, authorized vehicle recycler licensed under chapter 321H, or motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 322 to comply with any duty imposed by this section constitutes a violation of section 714.16, subsection 2, paragraph “a”.\n\n12.

      "text": "321.89 Abandoned vehicles.\n\n1. Definitions. As used in this section and sections 321.90 and 321.91 unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Abandoned vehicle” means any of the following:\n\n(1) A vehicle that has been left unattended on public property for more than twenty-four hours and lacks current registration plates or two or more wheels or other parts which renders the vehicle totally inoperable.\n\n(2) A vehicle that has remained illegally on public property for more than twenty-four hours.\n\n(3) A vehicle that has been unlawfully parked on private property or has been placed on private property without the consent of the owner or person in control of the property for more than twenty-four hours.\n\n(4) A vehicle that has been legally impounded by order of a police authority and has not been reclaimed for a period of ten days. However, a police authority may declare the vehicle abandoned within the ten-day period by commencing the notification process in subsection 3.\n\n(5) Any vehicle parked on the highway determined by a police authority to create a hazard to other vehicle traffic.\n\n(6) A vehicle that has been impounded pursuant to section 321J.4B by order of the court and whose owner has not paid the impoundment fees after notification by the person or agency responsible for carrying out the impoundment order.\n\nb. “Demolisher” means a person licensed under chapter 321H whose business it is to convert a vehicle to junk, processed scrap, or scrap metal, or otherwise to wreck or dismantle vehicles.\n\nc. “Police authority” means the state patrol, any law enforcement agency of a county or city, or any special security officer employed by the state board of regents under section 262.13.\n\n2. Authority to take possession of abandoned vehicles. A police authority, upon the authority’s own initiative or upon the request of any other authority having the duties of control of highways or traffic, shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take into custody an abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving, storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person in control of private property may employ a private entity who is a garagekeeper, as defined in section 321.90, to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take into custody the abandoned vehicle without a police authority’s initiative. If a police authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police authority shall provide the private entity with the names and addresses of the registered owners, all lienholders of record, and any other known claimant to the vehicle or the personal property found in the vehicle. The owners, lienholders, or other claimants of the abandoned vehicle shall not have a cause of action against a private entity for action taken under this section if the private entity provides notice as required by subsection 3, paragraphs “a” through “f”.\n\n3. Notification of owner, lienholders, and other claimants.\n\na. A police authority or private entity that takes into custody an abandoned vehicle shall send notice by certified mail that the vehicle has been taken into custody no more than twenty days after taking custody of the vehicle. Notice shall be sent to the last known address of record of the last known registered owner of the vehicle, all lienholders of record, and any other known claimant to the vehicle.\n\nb. Notice shall be deemed given when mailed. The notice shall include all of the following:\n\n(1) A description of the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of the vehicle.\n\n(2) The location of the facility where the vehicle is being held.\n\n(3) Information for the persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle and personal property contained therein within ten days after the effective date of the notice. Persons may reclaim the vehicle or personal property upon payment of all towing, preservation, and storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of notice required pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(4) A statement that failure of the owner, lienholders, or claimants to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders, and claimants of all right, title, claim, and interest in the vehicle or personal property.\n\n(5) A statement that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent for the police authority or private entity to sell the vehicle at a public auction or dispose of the vehicle to a demolisher and to dispose of the personal property by sale or destruction.\n\nc. If the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity may claim a garagekeeper’s lien as described in section 321.90, subsection 1, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle.\n\nd. If the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity hired by a police authority, the notice shall state that any person claiming rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the planned disposition of the vehicle or personal property by the police authority or private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to contest those matters.\n\ne. If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a hearing or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders, or claimants shall no longer have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal property.\n\nf. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right, title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.\n\ng. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice under this section. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in this subsection.\n\n4. Reclamation of abandoned vehicles. Prior to driving an abandoned vehicle away from the premises, a person who received or who is reclaiming the vehicle on behalf of a person who received notice under subsection 3 shall present to the police authority or private entity, as applicable, the person’s valid driver’s license and proof of financial liability coverage as provided in section 321.20B.\n\n5. Auction of abandoned vehicles.\n\na. If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided for in subsection 3, the police authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or not the vehicle shall be sold for use upon the highways. If the vehicle is not sold for use upon the highways, it shall be sold for junk, or demolished and sold as scrap. The police authority or private entity shall sell the vehicle at public auction. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a police authority or private entity may dispose of the vehicle to a demolisher for junk without public auction after complying with the notification procedures in subsection 3. The purchaser of the vehicle takes title free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership, shall receive a sales receipt from the police authority or private entity, and is entitled to register the vehicle and receive a certificate of title if sold for use upon the highways. If the vehicle is sold or disposed of to a demolisher for junk, the demolisher shall make application for a junking certificate to the county treasurer within thirty days of purchase and shall surrender the sales receipt in lieu of the certificate of title.\n\nb. From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned vehicle the police authority, if the police authority did not hire a private entity, shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the auction, the costs of towing, preserving, and storing which resulted from placing the abandoned vehicle in custody, all notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to subsection 3, the cost of inspection, and any other costs incurred except costs of bookkeeping and other administrative costs. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety days, and shall then be deposited in the road use tax fund. The costs to police authorities of auction, towing, preserving, storage, and all notice and publication costs, and all other costs which result from placing abandoned vehicles in custody, whenever the proceeds from a sale of the abandoned vehicles are insufficient to meet these expenses and costs, shall be paid from the road use tax fund and are the obligation of the last owner or owners, jointly and severally.\n\nc. The director of transportation shall establish by rule a claims procedure to be followed by police authorities in obtaining expenses and costs from the fund and procedures for reimbursement of expenses and costs to a private entity hired by a police authority to take custody of an abandoned vehicle. If a private entity has been hired by a police authority, the police authority shall file a claim with the department for reimbursement of towing fees which shall be paid from the road use tax fund.\n\n[C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321.89]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1305, §59; 85 Acts, ch 64, §2; 87 Acts, ch 123, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1158, §66; 92 Acts, ch 1238, §31; 95 Acts, ch 48, §3; 95 Acts, ch 118, §13; 96 Acts, ch 1126, §4; 98 Acts, ch 1074, §22; 2000 Acts, ch 1016, §11; 2005 Acts, ch 35, §31; 2005 Acts, ch 64, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 130, §23, 24; 2021 Acts, ch 22, §1, 2; 2021 Acts, ch 174, §15; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §67, 187\n\nReferred to in §8A.323, 80.39, 321.20B, 321.88, 321.90, 321.91, 321J.4B, 555B.1\n\n2022 amendment to subsection 2 applies retroactively to July 1, 2021; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §187",

      "text": "321.90 Disposal of abandoned motor vehicles.\n\n1. Garagekeepers and abandoned motor vehicles. Any motor vehicle left in a garage operated for commercial purposes after the period for which the vehicle was to remain on the premises shall, after notice by certified mail to the last known registered owner of the vehicle addressed to the owner’s last known address of record to reclaim the vehicle within ten days of the date of the notice, be deemed an abandoned motor vehicle unless reclaimed by the owner within such ten-day period or the owner notifies the garagekeeper in writing within such period of time that such vehicle is not an abandoned motor vehicle and shall be reported by the garagekeeper to the police authority. If the identity or address of the last registered owner of the motor vehicle cannot be determined, the vehicle shall be deemed an abandoned motor vehicle on the eleventh day after the period for which the vehicle was to remain on the premises unless reclaimed by the owner within the ten-day period or the owner notifies the garagekeeper in writing within such period of time that such vehicle is not an abandoned motor vehicle and shall be reported by the garagekeeper to the police authority. All abandoned motor vehicles left in garages may be taken into custody by a police authority upon the request of the garagekeeper and sold in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 321.89, subsection 5, unless the motor vehicle is reclaimed. The proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the garagekeeper’s charges for towing and storage, and any surplus proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with section 321.89, subsection 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair any lien of a garagekeeper under the laws of this state, or the right of a garagekeeper to foreclose the garagekeeper’s lien, provided that a garagekeeper shall be deemed to have abandoned the garagekeeper’s artisan lien when such vehicle is taken into custody by the police authority. For the purposes of this section “garagekeeper” means any operator of a parking place or establishment, motor vehicle storage facility, or establishment for the servicing, repair, or maintenance of motor vehicles.\n\n2. Disposal to demolisher.\n\na. Any person, firm, corporation, or unit of government upon whose property or in whose possession is found any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed and is thereby unable to transfer title to the motor vehicle, may apply to the police authority of the jurisdiction in which the motor vehicle is situated for authority to sell, give away, or otherwise dispose of the motor vehicle to a demolisher.\n\nb. The application shall set out the name and address of the applicant, and the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle, if ascertainable, together with any other identifying features, and shall contain a concise statement of the facts surrounding the abandonment, or a statement that the title of the motor vehicle is lost or destroyed, or the reasons for the defect of title in the owner. The applicant shall execute an affidavit stating that the facts alleged are true and that no material fact has been withheld. An order for disposal obtained pursuant to section 555B.8, subsection 3, satisfies the application requirements of this paragraph.\n\nc. If the police authority finds that the application is executed in proper form, and shows that the motor vehicle has been abandoned upon the property of the applicant, or if it shows that the motor vehicle is not abandoned but that the applicant appears to be the rightful owner, the police authority shall follow appropriate notification procedures as set forth in section 321.89, subsection 3, except that in the case of an order for disposal obtained pursuant to section 555B.8, subsection 3, no notification is required.\n\nd. If the abandoned motor vehicle is not reclaimed in accordance with section 321.89, subsection 3, or no lienholder objects to the disposal in the case of an owner-applicant, the police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority allowing the applicant to obtain a junking certificate for the motor vehicle. The applicant shall make application for a junking certificate to the county treasurer within thirty days of receipt of the certificate of authority and surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title. The demolisher shall accept the junking certificate in lieu of the certificate of title to the motor vehicle.\n\ne. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section and sections 321.89 and 321.91, any person, firm, corporation, or unit of government upon whose property or in whose possession is found any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor vehicle to a demolisher for junk without a title and without the notification procedures of section 321.89, subsection 3, if the motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The owner shall apply to the county treasurer for a junking certificate within thirty days of receipt of the certificate of authority and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.\n\nf. The owner of an abandoned motor vehicle and all lienholders shall no longer have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the motor vehicle; and no court in any case in law or equity shall recognize any right, title, claim, or interest of any owner or lienholders after the disposal of the motor vehicle to a demolisher.\n\ng. Any proceeds from the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle to a demolisher under this section, by one other than the owner of the vehicle, except the sale of a vehicle pursuant to an order for disposal obtained pursuant to section 555B.8, subsection 3, shall first be applied to that person’s expenses in effecting the sale, including storage, towing, and disposal charges, and any surplus shall be distributed in accordance with section 321.89, subsection 5. The proceeds from the sale of a vehicle disposed of pursuant to section 555B.8, subsection 3, shall be distributed in accordance with section 555B.9.\n\n3. Duties of demolishers.\n\na. Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle for junk under the provisions of this section shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or demolish such motor vehicle. A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or demolish a vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate issued for the vehicle.\n\nb. A demolisher shall keep an accurate and complete record of all motor vehicles purchased or received by the demolisher in the course of the demolisher’s business. These records shall contain the name and address of the person from whom each motor vehicle was purchased or received and the date when the purchases or receipts occurred. The records shall be open for inspection by any police authority at any time during normal business hours. Any record required by this section shall be kept by the demolisher for at least one year after the transaction to which it applies.\n\n[C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321.90]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1138, §12 – 14; 95 Acts, ch 118, §14, 15; 2005 Acts, ch 179, §128; 2008 Acts, ch 1018, §19\n\nReferred to in §8A.323, 321.89, 321.91, 555B.9",

The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings, except in those instances where the context clearly indicates otherwise:\n\na. “Department” means the department of revenue.\n\nb. “Director” means the director of revenue.\n\nc. “Owner” means as defined in section 321.1. For purposes of the fee for new registration imposed on leased vehicles under subsection 3, “owner” means the “lessor”.\n\nd. “Purchase” means any transfer, exchange, or barter, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, for consideration.\n\n2. Fee imposed — exemptions. In addition to the annual registration fee required under section 321.105, a “fee for new registration” is imposed in the amount of five percent of the purchase price for each vehicle subject to registration. The fee for new registration shall be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the county treasurer at the time application is made for a new registration and certificate of title, if applicable. A new registration receipt shall not be issued until the fee has been paid. The county treasurer or the department of transportation shall require every applicant for a new registration receipt for a vehicle subject to registration to supply information as the county treasurer or the director deems necessary as to the time of purchase, the purchase price, and other information relative to the purchase of the vehicle. On or before the tenth day of each month, the county treasurer or the department of transportation shall remit to the department of revenue the amount of the fees for new registration collected during the preceding month.\n\na. For purposes of this subsection, “purchase price” applies to the measure subject to the fee for new registration. “Purchase price” shall be determined in the same manner as “sales price” is determined for purposes of computing the tax imposed upon the sales price of tangible personal property under chapter 423, pursuant to the definition of sales price in section 423.1. The following are exempt from the fee for new registration imposed by this subsection:\n\n(1) The amount of any cash rebate which is provided by a motor vehicle manufacturer to the purchaser of the vehicle subject to registration so long as the rebate is applied to the purchase price of the vehicle.\n\n(2) (a) In transactions, except those subject to subparagraph division (b), in which a vehicle subject to registration is traded toward the purchase price of another vehicle subject to registration, the portion of the purchase price which is not valued in money, whether received in money or not, if the following conditions are met:\n\n(i) The vehicle traded to the retailer is the type of vehicle normally sold in the regular course of the retailer’s business.\n\n(ii) The vehicle traded to the retailer is intended by the retailer to be ultimately sold at retail or is intended to be used by the retailer or another in the remanufacturing of a like vehicle.\n\n(b) In a transaction between persons, neither of which is a retailer of vehicles subject to registration, in which a vehicle subject to registration is traded toward the purchase price of another vehicle subject to registration, the amount of the trade-in value allowed on the vehicle subject to registration traded.\n\n(c) The person listed on the title and registration of the newly acquired vehicle must be the same person listed on the title and registration of the traded vehicle being traded in order to exclude the trade-in value from the purchase price. Additionally, the following trades qualify under this subparagraph division (c):\n\n(i) A trade between spouses, if the traded vehicle and the acquired vehicle are titled in the name of one or both of the spouses, with no outside party named on the title.\n\n(ii) A trade between lineal family members, including adopted and step relationships, if one of the family members from the title of the traded vehicle is also on the title of the newly acquired vehicle.\n\n(iii) A trade involving an entity, if one of the owners listed on the title of the traded vehicle is an entity. If multiple names appear on the title, the names must be separated by “or”.

The county treasurer or the department of transportation shall require every applicant for a registration receipt for a vehicle subject to a fee for new registration to supply information as the county treasurer or the director deems necessary as to the date of the lease transaction, the lease price, and other information relative to the lease of the vehicle.\n\nd.

If an amount of the fee for new registration represented by a dealer to the purchaser of a vehicle is computed upon a purchase price that is not subject to the fee for new registration or the amount represented is in excess of the actual amount subject to the fee and the amount represented is actually paid by the purchaser to the dealer, the excess amount of fee for new registration paid shall be returned to the purchaser upon notification to the dealer by the department that an excess payment exists.\n\nb.

No cause of action shall accrue against a dealer for excess fee for new registration paid until sixty days after proper notification has been given the dealer by the purchaser.\n\nc. In the circumstances described in paragraphs “a” and “b”, a dealer has the option to either return any excess amount of fee for new registration paid to a purchaser, or to remit the amount which a purchaser has paid to the dealer to the department.\n\n6.

If the vehicle is destroyed by fire or accident, or junked and its identity as a vehicle entirely eliminated, the owner in whose name the vehicle was registered at the time of destruction or dismantling shall return the plates to the department and within thirty days thereafter make a statement of such destruction or dismantling and make claim for refund. With reference to the destruction or dismantling of a vehicle, no refund shall be allowed unless a junking certificate has been issued, as provided in section 321.52.\n\nb. If the vehicle is stolen, the owner shall give notice of the theft to the department within five days. If the vehicle is not recovered by the owner thirty days prior to the end of the current registration year, the owner shall make a statement of the theft and make claim for refund.\n\nc.

If the vehicle is registered by the county treasurer during the current registration year and the owner or lessee registers the vehicle for apportioned registration under chapter 326, the owner of the registered vehicle shall surrender the registration plates to the county treasurer and may file a claim for refund. In lieu of a refund, a credit for the annual registration fees paid to the county treasurer may be applied by the department to the owner or lessee’s apportioned registration fees upon the surrender of the county plates and registration.\n\ne.

The refund is subject to the following limitations:\n\n(1) If a vehicle registration fee credit has not been received by the owner of the vehicle under section 321.46, subsection 3, the refund shall be computed on the basis of the number of unexpired months remaining in the registration year at the time the vehicle was sold or junked. The refund shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Section 321.127, subsection 1, does not apply.\n\n(2) The refund shall only be allowed if the owner makes claim for the refund within six months after the date of the vehicle’s sale, trade, or junking.\n\n(3) This paragraph “f” does not apply to vehicles registered under chapter 326.\n\ng. If the vehicle was leased and an affidavit was filed by the lessor or the lessee as provided in section 321.46, the lessor or the lessee, as applicable, may make a claim for a refund with the county treasurer of the county where the vehicle was registered within six months of the vehicle’s surrender to the lessor. The refund shall be paid to either the lessor or the lessee, as specified on the application for title and registration pursuant to section 321.20.\n\nh.

For purposes of section 321.127, the unexpired months remaining in the registration year shall be calculated on the basis of the effective date of the out-of-state registration. However, for the purpose of timely issuance of the refund, the claim for a refund under this paragraph is considered to be filed on the date the registration documents are received by the county treasurer.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, there shall be no refund of apportioned registration fees unless the state which issued the base plate for the vehicle allows such refund.

However, the department may issue restricted and special driver’s licenses to certain minors as provided in sections 321.178 and 321.194, and driver’s licenses restricted to motorized bicycles as provided in section 321.189. A license or permit shall not be issued under this section or section 321.178 or 321.194 without the consent of a parent or guardian or a person having custody of the applicant under chapter 232 or 600A. An additional consent is required each time a license or permit is issued under this section or section 321.178 or 321.194. The consent must be signed by at least one parent, guardian, or custodian on an affidavit form provided by the department.\n\n1. Instruction permit.\n\na. The department may issue an instruction permit to an applicant between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years if the applicant meets the requirements of sections 321.184 and 321.186, other than a driving demonstration, and pays the required fee. An instruction permit issued under this section shall be valid for a period not to exceed four years from the licensee’s birthday anniversary in the year of issuance. A motorcycle instruction permit issued under this section is not renewable.\n\nb. Subject to the limitations in this subsection, an instruction permit entitles the permittee, while having the permit in the permittee’s immediate possession, to operate a motor vehicle other than a commercial motor vehicle or as a chauffeur or a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of sixteen thousand one or more pounds upon the highways.\n\nc. (1) Except as otherwise provided, a permittee who is less than eighteen years of age and who is operating a motor vehicle must be accompanied by a person issued a driver’s license valid for the vehicle operated who is the parent, guardian, or custodian of the permittee, a member of the permittee’s immediate family if the family member is at least twenty-one years of age, an approved driver education instructor, a prospective driver education instructor who is enrolled in a practitioner preparation program with a safety education program approved by the state board of education, or a person at least twenty-five years of age if written permission is granted by the parent, guardian, or custodian, and who is actually occupying a seat beside the driver. A permittee shall not operate a motor vehicle if the number of passengers in the motor vehicle exceeds the number of passenger safety belts in the motor vehicle. If the applicant for an instruction permit holds a driver’s license issued in this state valid for the operation of a motorized bicycle or a motorcycle, the instruction permit shall be valid for such operation without the requirement of an accompanying person.\n\n(2) If the permittee is operating a motorcycle in accordance with this section, the accompanying person must be within audible and visual communications distance from the permittee and be accompanying the permittee on or in a different motor vehicle. Only one permittee shall be under the immediate supervision of an accompanying qualified person.\n\nd. A permittee shall not be penalized for failing to have the instruction permit in the permittee’s immediate possession if the permittee produces in court, within a reasonable time, an instruction permit issued to the permittee and valid at the time of the permittee’s arrest or at the time the permittee was charged with failure to have the permit in the permittee’s immediate possession.\n\n2. Intermediate license.\n\na. The department may issue an intermediate driver’s license to a person sixteen or seventeen years of age who possesses an instruction permit issued under subsection 1 or a comparable instruction permit issued by another state for a minimum of twelve months immediately preceding application, and who presents an affidavit signed by a parent, guardian, or custodian on a form to be provided by the department that the permittee has accumulated a total of twenty hours of street or highway driving of which two hours were conducted after sunset and before sunrise and the street or highway driving was with the permittee’s parent, guardian, custodian, instructor, a person certified by the department, or a person at least twenty-five years of age who had written permission from a parent, guardian, or custodian to accompany the permittee, and whose driving privileges have not been suspended, revoked, or barred under this chapter or chapter 321J during, and who has been accident and violation free continuously for, the six-month period immediately preceding the application for an intermediate license. An applicant for an intermediate license must meet the requirements of section 321.186, including satisfactory completion of driver education as required in section 321.178 or 321.178A, and payment of the required license fee before an intermediate license will be issued. A person issued an intermediate license must limit the number of passengers in the motor vehicle when the intermediate licensee is operating the motor vehicle to the number of passenger safety belts. In addition, unless waived by the person’s parent or guardian at the time the intermediate license is issued, for the first six months following issuance of the license, a person issued an intermediate license must limit the number of unrelated minor passengers in the motor vehicle when the intermediate licensee is operating the motor vehicle to one, except when the intermediate licensee is accompanied in accordance with subsection 1. For purposes of this subsection, “unrelated minor passenger” means a passenger who is under eighteen years of age and who is not a sibling of the driver, a stepsibling of the driver, or a child who resides in the same household as the driver. The department shall prescribe the form for waiver of the six-month restriction on unrelated minor passengers, which may be in an electronic format, and shall designate characteristics for the intermediate license that shall distinguish between an intermediate license that includes the six-month restriction on unrelated minor passengers and an intermediate license that does not include the six-month restriction on unrelated minor passengers.\n\nb. Except as otherwise provided, a person issued an intermediate license under this subsection who is operating a motor vehicle between the hours of 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. must be accompanied by a person issued a driver’s license valid for the vehicle operated who is the parent, guardian, or custodian of the intermediate licensee, a member of the intermediate licensee’s immediate family if the family member is at least twenty-one years of age, an approved driver education instructor, a prospective driver education instructor who is enrolled in a practitioner preparation program with a safety education program approved by the state board of education, or a person at least twenty-five years of age if written permission is granted by the parent, guardian, or custodian, and who is actually occupying a seat beside the driver. However, a licensee may operate a vehicle to and from school-related extracurricular activities and work without an accompanying driver between the hours of 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. if the licensee possesses a waiver on a form to be provided by the department. An accompanying driver is not required between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m.\n\n3. Remedial driver improvement action — suspension of permit, intermediate license, or full license.\n\na. A person who has been issued an instruction permit, an intermediate license, or a full driver’s license under this section, upon conviction of a moving traffic violation or involvement in a motor vehicle accident which occurred during the term of the instruction permit or intermediate license, shall be subject to remedial driver improvement action or suspension of the permit or current license. A person possessing an instruction permit who has been convicted of a moving traffic violation or has been involved in an accident shall not be issued an intermediate license until the person has completed the remedial driver improvement action and has been accident and violation free continuously for the six-month period immediately preceding the application for the intermediate license. A person possessing an intermediate license who has been convicted of a moving traffic violation or has been involved in an accident shall not be issued a full driver’s license until the person has completed the remedial driver improvement action and has been accident and violation free continuously for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the application for a full driver’s license.\n\nb. The department may suspend an instruction permit, intermediate license, or full license issued under this section upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the person issued the instruction permit, intermediate license, or full license violated the restrictions imposed under subsection 1, 2, or 6 during the term of the instruction permit or intermediate license.\n\n4. Full driver’s license. A full driver’s license may be issued to a person seventeen years of age who possesses an intermediate license issued under subsection 2 or a comparable intermediate license issued by another state for a minimum of twelve months immediately preceding application, and who presents an affidavit signed by a parent, guardian, or custodian on a form to be provided by the department that the intermediate licensee has accumulated a total of ten hours of street or highway driving of which two hours were conducted after sunset and before sunrise and the street or highway driving was with the licensee’s parent, guardian, custodian, instructor, a person certified by the department, or a person at least twenty-five years of age who had written permission from a parent, guardian, or custodian to accompany the licensee, whose driving privileges have not been suspended, revoked, or barred under this chapter or chapter 321J during, and who has been accident and violation free continuously for, the twelve-month period immediately preceding the application for a full driver’s license, and who has paid the required fee.\n\n5. Class M license education requirements. A person under the age of eighteen applying for an intermediate or full driver’s license valid for the operation of a motorcycle shall be required to successfully complete a motorcycle education course either approved and established by the department of transportation or from a private or commercial driver education school licensed by the department of transportation before the class M license will be issued. A public school district shall charge a student a fee which shall not exceed the actual cost of instruction minus moneys received by the school district under section 321.179.\n\n6. Use of electronic devices or equipment.\n\na. A person issued an instruction permit or intermediate driver’s license under this section shall not use an electronic communication device or an electronic entertainment device while driving a motor vehicle unless the motor vehicle is at a complete stop off the traveled portion of the roadway. This paragraph does not apply to the use of electronic equipment which is permanently installed in the motor vehicle or to a portable device which is operated through permanently installed equipment.\n\nb. The department, in cooperation with the department of public safety, shall establish educational programs to foster compliance with the requirements of paragraph “a”.\n\n7. Citations for violation of restrictions. A person who violates the restrictions imposed under subsection 1, 2, or 6 may be issued a citation under this section and shall not be issued a citation under section 321.193. A violation of the restrictions imposed under subsection 1, 2, or 6 shall not be considered a moving violation.\n\n8. Rules.

A driver’s license may be issued for more than one class. Class A and B driver’s licenses shall only be issued as commercial driver’s licenses. Class C and M driver’s licenses may be issued as commercial driver’s licenses. A driver’s license is not valid for the operation of a vehicle requiring an endorsement unless the driver’s license is endorsed for the vehicle. A class D driver’s license is also valid as a noncommercial class C driver’s license. The holder of a commercial driver’s license is not required to obtain a class D driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle as a chauffeur. When necessary, the department shall by rule create additional classes or modify existing classes of driver’s licenses, however, the rule shall be temporary and if within sixty days after the next regular session of the general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made corresponding changes in this chapter, the temporary classification or modification shall be nullified.\n\n2. Content of license.\n\na. Appearing on the driver’s license shall be a distinguishing number assigned to the licensee; the licensee’s full name, date of birth, sex, and residence address; a color photograph; a physical description of the licensee; the name of the state; the dates of issuance and expiration; and the usual signature of the licensee.

The license may contain other information as required under the department’s rules.\n\n3. Replacement. If prior to the renewal date, a person desires to obtain a driver’s license in the form authorized by this section, a license may be issued as a voluntary replacement upon payment of the required fee as set by the department by rule. A person shall return a driver’s license and be issued a new license when the first license contains inaccurate information upon payment of the required fee as set by the department by rule.\n\n4. Symbols. Upon the request of a licensee, the department shall indicate on the license the presence of a medical condition, that the licensee is a donor under the revised uniform anatomical gift Act as provided in chapter 142C, or that the licensee has in effect a medical advance directive. For purposes of this subsection, a medical advance directive includes but is not limited to a valid durable power of attorney for health care as defined in section 144B.1. The license may contain such other information as the department may require by rule.\n\n5. Tamperproofing. The department shall issue a driver’s license by a method or process which prevents as nearly as possible the alteration, reproduction, or superimposition of a photograph on the license without ready detection.\n\n6. Licenses or nonoperator’s identification cards issued to persons under age twenty-one. A driver’s license issued to a person under eighteen years of age shall contain the same information as any other driver’s license except that the words “under eighteen” shall appear prominently on the face of the license. A driver’s license issued to a person eighteen years of age or older but less than twenty-one years of age shall contain the same information as any other driver’s license except that the words “under twenty-one” shall appear prominently on the face of the license. Upon attaining the age of eighteen or upon attaining the age of twenty-one, and upon payment of a ten dollar fee, the person shall be entitled to a new driver’s license or nonoperator’s identification card for the unexpired months of the driver’s license or card. Upon attaining the age of twenty-one, a person who is otherwise eligible to be issued a driver’s license or nonoperator’s identification card shall be eligible to apply electronically for issuance of a replacement license or card for the unexpired months of the license or card, regardless of whether the most recent previous issuance of the license or card occurred electronically. The department shall, within a reasonable time period prior to a person’s twenty-first birthday anniversary, notify the person of the person’s eligibility to apply for a replacement driver’s license or nonoperator’s identification card electronically upon attaining the age of twenty-one.

The license is valid for a period not to exceed two years from the licensee’s birthday anniversary in the year of issuance, subject to termination or cancellation as provided in this section.\n\nb. A driver’s license valid only for operation of a motorized bicycle shall be canceled upon a conviction for a moving traffic violation and reapplication may be made thirty days after the date of cancellation. The cancellation of the license upon conviction for a moving traffic violation shall not result in requiring the applicant to maintain proof of financial responsibility under section 321A.17, unless the conviction would otherwise result in a suspension or revocation of a person’s driver’s license.\n\nc. As used in this section, “moving traffic violation” does not include a parking violation as defined in section 321.210 or a violation of a section of the Code or municipal ordinance pertaining to standards to be maintained for motor vehicle equipment except sections 321.430 and 321.431, or except a municipal ordinance pertaining to motor vehicle brake requirements as applicable to motorized bicycles.\n\nd. The holder of any class of driver’s license may operate a motorized bicycle.\n\ne. A person who violates this subsection commits a simple misdemeanor.\n\n8. Veterans status. A licensee who is an honorably discharged veteran of the armed forces of the United States may request that the license be marked to reflect the licensee’s veteran status. Upon such a request, the word “VETERAN” shall be marked prominently on the face of the license. Such a license shall be issued upon receipt of satisfactory proof of veteran status pursuant to procedures established by the department in consultation with the department of veterans affairs, or upon presentation of the licensee’s certification of release or discharge from active duty, DD form 214, to the department at the time of the licensee’s request, if the form indicates the licensee was honorably discharged.

After receiving notification from the department, the commission of veteran affairs shall initiate contact with the licensee.\n\n9. Deaf or hard-of-hearing status. A licensee who is a deaf person or a hard-of-hearing person, as those terms are defined in section 622B.1, may request that the license be marked to reflect the licensee’s deaf or hard-of-hearing status on the face of the license when the licensee applies for the issuance or renewal of a license. The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A establishing criteria under which a license may be marked, including requiring the licensee to submit medical proof of the licensee’s deaf or hard-of-hearing status. When a driver’s license is so marked, the licensee’s deaf or hard-of-hearing status shall be noted in the electronic database used by the department and law enforcement to access registration, titling, and driver’s license information. The department, in consultation with the commission of deaf services, shall develop educational media to raise awareness of a licensee’s ability to request the license be marked to reflect the licensee’s deaf or hard-of-hearing status.\n\n10.

The department may issue a class C or M driver’s license to a person between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years if all of the following apply:\n\na. The person’s driving privileges have not been suspended, revoked, or barred under this chapter or chapter 321J during, and the person has not been convicted of a moving traffic violation or involved in a motor vehicle accident for, the six-month period immediately preceding the application for the special minor’s license.\n\nb. The person has successfully completed an approved driver education course. However, the completion of a course is not required if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that completion of the course would impose a hardship upon the applicant. The department shall adopt rules defining the term “hardship” and establish procedures for the demonstration and determination of when completion of the course would impose a hardship upon an applicant.\n\nc. The person’s school has certified to the department that the person has a special need for the license pursuant to subsection 3.\n\n2. Driving privileges.\n\na. Permitted operations. The driver’s license entitles the licensee, while having the license in immediate possession, to operate a motor vehicle, other than a commercial motor vehicle, a motor vehicle with more than two axles, a motor vehicle towing another vehicle, or as a chauffeur, during the times and for the purposes set forth in this paragraph.\n\n(1) If the licensee attends a public school, the licensee may operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. as follows:\n\n(a) Over the most direct and accessible route between the licensee’s residence and schools of enrollment or the closest school bus stop or public transportation service, and between schools of enrollment, for the purpose of attending duly scheduled courses of instruction and extracurricular activities within the school district of enrollment.\n\n(b) Over the most direct and accessible route between the licensee’s residence or school of enrollment and a site, facility, or school that is not the licensee’s school of enrollment, for the purpose of participating in extracurricular activities conducted under a sharing agreement with the licensee’s school of enrollment or conducted at a site, facility, or school designated by the licensee’s school district for the accommodation of the school’s extracurricular activities, provided the site, facility, or school is within the licensee’s school district of enrollment or is within a school district contiguous to the licensee’s school district of enrollment.\n\n(2) If the licensee attends an accredited nonpublic school, the licensee may operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. as follows:\n\n(a) Over the most direct and accessible route between the licensee’s residence and schools of enrollment or the closest school bus stop or public transportation service, and between schools of enrollment, for the purpose of attending duly scheduled courses of instruction and extracurricular activities, provided the driving distance between the point of origin and the destination is no more than fifty miles.\n\n(b) Over the most direct and accessible route between the licensee’s residence or school of enrollment and a site, facility, or school that is not the licensee’s school of enrollment, for the purpose of participating in extracurricular activities conducted at a site, facility, or school designated by the licensee’s school of enrollment for the accommodation of the school’s extracurricular activities, provided the driving distance between the point of origin and the destination is no more than fifty miles.\n\n(3) If the licensee resides on a farm or is employed for compensation on a farm in this state, the licensee may operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. for the purpose of assisting the person’s parents, guardians, or employers with farm work or in connection with any farm job, employment, or other farm-related work, including traveling to or from the location of the farm work, provided the licensee operates the vehicle over the most direct and accessible route between the point of origin and the destination and the driving distance between the point of origin and the destination is no more than fifty miles.\n\n(4) To a service station for the purpose of refueling, so long as the service station is the station closest to the route on which the licensee is traveling under subparagraph (1), (2), or (3).\n\n(5) At any time when the licensee is accompanied in accordance with section 321.180B, subsection 1.\n\nb. Restrictions.\n\n(1) Passengers. Unless accompanied in accordance with section 321.180B, subsection 1, a person issued a driver’s license pursuant to this section must limit the number of unrelated minor passengers in the motor vehicle when the licensee is operating the motor vehicle to one. For purposes of this section, “unrelated minor passenger” means a passenger who is under eighteen years of age and who is not a sibling of the driver, a stepsibling of the driver, or a child who resides in the same household as the driver.\n\n(2) Electronic communication devices. A person issued a driver’s license under this section shall not use an electronic communication device or an electronic entertainment device while driving a motor vehicle unless the motor vehicle is at a complete stop off the traveled portion of the roadway. This subparagraph does not apply to the use of electronic equipment which is permanently installed in the motor vehicle or to a portable device which is operated through permanently installed equipment. The department, in cooperation with the department of public safety, shall establish educational programs to foster compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph.\n\n3. Certification of need and issuance of license.\n\na. Each application shall be accompanied by a statement from the applicant’s school of enrollment. The statement shall be upon a form provided by the department and shall certify that a need exists for the license and that the person signing the statement is not responsible for actions of the applicant which pertain to the use of the driver’s license.\n\n(1) If the applicant attends a public school, the certification shall be made by the school board, superintendent of the applicant’s school, or principal, if authorized by the superintendent.\n\n(2) If the applicant attends an accredited nonpublic school, the certification shall be made by the authorities in charge of the accredited nonpublic school or a duly authorized representative of the authorities.\n\nb. Upon receipt of a statement of necessity, the department shall issue the driver’s license provided the applicant is otherwise eligible for issuance of the license. The fact that the applicant resides at a distance less than one mile from the applicant’s school of enrollment is prima facie evidence of the nonexistence of necessity for the issuance of a license. However, the distance between the applicant’s residence and school of enrollment shall not be considered if the applicant resides on a farm or is employed for compensation on a farm.\n\nc. The school shall develop and adopt a policy establishing the criteria that the school shall use to approve or deny certification that a need exists for a license. If the school is a public school, the policy shall be developed and adopted by the school board. If the school is an accredited nonpublic school, the policy shall be developed and adopted according to procedures determined by the authorities in charge of the accredited nonpublic school.\n\nd. A student enrolled in a public school may appeal to the school board the decision of a school district administrator to deny certification. A student enrolled in an accredited nonpublic school may appeal the school’s decision to deny certification as permitted by the authorities in charge of the accredited nonpublic school. The decision of the school board or authorities in charge of the accredited nonpublic school is final.\n\ne. The driver’s license shall not be issued for purposes of attending a public school in a school district other than either of the following:\n\n(1) The district of residence of the parent or guardian of the student.\n\n(2) A district which is contiguous to the district of residence of the parent or guardian of the student, if the student is enrolled in the public school which is not the school district of residence because of open enrollment under section 282.18 or as a result of an election by the student’s district of residence to enter into one or more sharing agreements pursuant to the procedures in chapter 282.\n\nf. The driver’s license shall not be issued for purposes of attending an accredited nonpublic school if the driving distance between the school and the residence of the parent or guardian of the student is more than fifty miles.\n\n4. Suspension and revocation. A driver’s license issued under this section is subject to suspension or revocation for the same reasons and in the same manner as suspension or revocation of any other driver’s license. The department may also suspend a driver’s license issued under this section upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the licensee has violated the restrictions of the license or has been involved in one or more accidents chargeable to the licensee. The department may suspend a driver’s license issued under this section upon receiving a record of the licensee’s conviction for one violation. The department shall revoke the license upon receiving a record of conviction for two or more violations of a law of this state or a city ordinance regulating the operation of motor vehicles on highways other than parking violations as defined in section 321.210. After a person licensed under this section receives two or more convictions which require revocation of the person’s license under this section, the department shall not grant an application for a new driver’s license until the expiration of thirty days.\n\n5. Citations for violation of restrictions. A person who violates the restrictions imposed under subsection 2 may be issued a citation under this section and shall not be issued a citation under section 321.193. A violation of the restrictions imposed under subsection 2 shall not be considered a moving violation.\n\n[C31, 35, §4960-d5; C39, §5013.19; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §321.194; 82 Acts, ch 1248, §3]\n\n83 Acts, ch 49, §1, 4; 83 Acts, ch 101, §68; 84 Acts, ch 1022, §5; 84 Acts, ch 1219, §24; 89 Acts, ch 266, §2; 90 Acts, ch 1230, §40; 98 Acts, ch 1073, §9; 98 Acts, ch 1112, §8, 14, 16; 2001 Acts, ch 159, §17; 2005 Acts, ch 8, §18; 2009 Acts, ch 130, §7, 8; 2010 Acts, ch 1105, §3; 2011 Acts, ch 38, §15, 16; 2013 Acts, ch 80, §2, 3; 2014 Acts, ch 1025, §1, 2; 2014 Acts, ch 1092, §77; 2014 Acts, ch 1123, §14; 2016 Acts, ch 1098, §33; 2018 Acts, ch 1170, §5 – 7; 2019 Acts, ch 22, §1, 2; 2021 Acts, ch 6, §1 – 4\n\nReferred to in §321.177, 321.178, 321.180B, 321.191, 321.213, 321.482A, 321A.17, 805.8A(4)(g)\n\nFor applicable scheduled fine, see §805.8A, subsection 4\n\nAdditional penalties for violations causing injury or death, see §321.482A",

Vehicular traffic shall remain standing until a signal to proceed is shown, or vehicular traffic, unless prohibited by a sign, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn from the right lane of traffic or another lane designated for right turns, or a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street from the left lane of traffic or another lane designated for left turns.

A school bus shall, while carrying passengers, have its headlights turned on.\n\n2. All pupils shall be received and discharged from the right front entrance of every school bus and if said pupils must cross the highway, they shall be required to pass in front of the bus, look in both directions, and proceed to cross the highway only on signal from the bus driver.\n\n3. a. The driver of a vehicle, including the driver of a vehicle operating on a private road or driveway, when meeting a school bus with flashing amber warning lamps shall reduce the vehicle’s speed to not more than twenty miles per hour, and shall bring the vehicle to a complete stop when the school bus stops and the stop signal arm is extended.

Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply, the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a suspension action, in accordance with the home jurisdiction’s procedures, to suspend the motorist’s driver’s license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the home jurisdiction licensing authority. Due process safeguards shall be accorded.\n\nd. Exceptions. The provisions of the nonresident violator compact do not apply to parking or standing violations, highway weight limit violations, and violations of law governing the transportation of hazardous materials.\n\ne. Additional provisions. The nonresident violator compact may contain other provisions the director reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate for inclusion in the compact.\n\n2. Rules. The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n3. Enforcement.
