A county which is a member municipality may levy such tax only upon the property in the unincorporated area of such county. Such tax may be levied in excess of any tax limitation imposed by statute. Such ordinance shall be enacted only after publication of notice and hearing in the manner prescribed in section 330A.6. Upon such enactment, a copy thereof shall be certified to the authority. An authority shall have the power to enforce the collection of such levy by mandamus or other appropriate remedy and such levy shall be collected in the manner other taxes are collected and allocated and paid to the authority for the exclusive and proper use of the authority, including but not limited to the purchase of land, and the acquiring, establishing, constructing, enlarging, operating, and maintaining of aviation facilities. In addition to the purposes listed above, moneys in said fund may be pledged to the payment of the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on bonds of the authority.

Any such money so deposited shall be considered a gift and is not repayable.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §330A.15]\n\nReferred to in §331.424, 384.12",
