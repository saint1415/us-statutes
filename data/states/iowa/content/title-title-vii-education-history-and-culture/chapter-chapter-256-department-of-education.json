Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 12 and as an exception to their requirements, a private high school or private combined junior-senior high school operated for the express purpose of teaching a program designed to qualify its graduates for matriculation at accredited four-year or equivalent liberal arts, scientific, or technological colleges or universities shall be placed on a special accredited list of college preparatory schools, which list shall signify accreditation of the school for that express purpose only, if:\n\na. The school complies with minimum standards established by the Code other than this section, and rules adopted under the Code, applicable to:\n\n(1) Courses comprising the limited program.\n\n(2) Health requirements for personnel.\n\n(3) Plant facilities.\n\n(4) Other environmental factors affecting the programs.\n\nb. At least eighty percent of those graduating from the school within the four most recent calendar years, other than those graduating who are aliens, graduates entering military or alternative civilian service, or graduates deceased or incapacitated before college acceptance, have been accepted by accredited four-year or equivalent liberal arts, scientific, or technological colleges or universities.\n\nc. A school claiming to be a private college preparatory school which fails to comply with the requirement of paragraph “b” of this subsection shall be placed on the special accredited list of college preparatory schools probationally if the school complies with the requirements of paragraph “a” of this subsection, but a probational accreditation shall not continue for more than four successive years.\n\n14. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 13 and as an exception to their requirements, a nonpublic grade school which is reopening is accredited even if it does not have a complete grade one through grade six program. However, the nonpublic grade school must comply with other minimum standards established by law and administrative rules adopted pursuant to the law, and the nonpublic grade school must show progress toward reaching a grade one through grade six program.\n\n15. The board of directors of a school district or the authorities in charge of a nonpublic school may award credit toward graduation to a student if the student successfully completes basic training for service as a member of the Iowa army national guard, the Iowa air national guard, the active military forces of the United States, the army national guard of the United States, or the air national guard of the United States.\n\n16. a. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 12, a nonpublic school may be accredited by an approved independent accrediting agency instead of by the state board as provided in this subsection. The state board shall maintain a list of approved independent accrediting agencies comprised of at least six regional or national nonprofit, nongovernmental agencies recognized as reliable authorities concerning the quality of education offered by a school and shall publish the list of independent accrediting agencies on the department’s internet site. The list shall include accrediting agencies that, as of January 1, 2013, accredited a nonpublic school in this state that was concurrently accredited under this section; and any agency that has a formalized partnership agreement with another agency on the list and has member schools in this state as of January 1, 2013.\n\nb. A nonpublic school that participates in the accreditation process offered by an independent accrediting agency on the approved list published pursuant to paragraph “a” shall be deemed to meet the education standards of this section. However, such a school shall comply with statutory health and safety requirements for school facilities.\n\nc. If the state board takes preliminary action to remove an agency from the approved list published on the department’s internet site pursuant to paragraph “a”, the department shall, at least one year prior to removing the agency from the approved list, notify the nonpublic schools participating in the accreditation process offered by the agency of the state board’s intent to remove the accrediting agency from its approved list of independent accrediting agencies. The notice shall also be posted on the department’s internet site and shall contain the proposed date of removal. The nonpublic school shall attain accreditation under this subsection or subsections 1 through 12 not later than one year following the date on which the state board removes the agency from its list of independent accrediting agencies.\n\n17. a. (1) The offer and teach requirements of subsection 5, paragraphs “a” through “e” and “g” through “j”, shall not apply for up to two specified subjects at a school district or accredited nonpublic school if any of the following apply:\n\n(a) The school district or accredited nonpublic school makes every reasonable and good faith effort to employ a teacher licensed under subchapter VII, part 3, for the specified subject and is unable to employ such a teacher.\n\n(b) Fewer than ten students typically register for instruction in the specified subject at the school district or accredited nonpublic school.\n\n(2) If a school district or accredited nonpublic school meets the requirements of subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (a) or (b), the school district or accredited nonpublic school may exceed the two-subject limitation specified in subparagraph (1), unnumbered paragraph 1, for the purpose of providing world language, personal finance literacy, and computer science coursework online in accordance with paragraph “c”.\n\nb. The department may waive the applicability of subsection 5, paragraphs “a” through “e” and “g” through “j”, for up to two additional specified subject areas for a school district or accredited nonpublic school that proves to the satisfaction of the department that the school district or accredited nonpublic school has made every reasonable effort, but is unable to meet such requirements. A school district or accredited nonpublic school may apply for an annual waiver each year.\n\nc. If the provisions of subsection 5, paragraphs “a” through “e” and “g” through “j”, are made inapplicable under paragraph “a”, or are waived under paragraph “b”, the specified subject shall be provided by an area education agency under section 273.16, or by the school district or accredited nonpublic school if an online alternative satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1), (2), or (3) can be made available by the school district or accredited nonpublic school. Any course not required under subsection 5 may also be provided by an area education agency under section 273.16 or by the school district or accredited nonpublic school. However, in either case, if offered by the school district or accredited nonpublic school, the specified subject or course shall be offered through any of the following means:\n\n(1) An online learning platform if the course is developed by the school district or accredited nonpublic school itself or is developed by a partnership or consortium of schools that have developed the course individually or cooperatively, provided the course is taught and supervised by a teacher licensed under subchapter VII, part 3, who has online learning experience and the course content meets the requirements established by rule pursuant to section 256.7, subsection 32, paragraph “c”. A partnership or consortium of schools may include two or more school districts or accredited nonpublic schools, or any combination thereof.\n\n(2) A private provider utilized to provide the course that meets the standards of this section and is approved in accordance with section 256.9, subsection 55.\n\n(3) An online learning platform offered, subject to the initial availability of federal funds, by the department in collaboration with one or more area education agencies or in partnership with school districts and accredited nonpublic schools. The online learning platform may deliver distance education to students, including students receiving competent private instruction under chapter 299A, provided such students register with the school district of residence and the coursework offered by the online learning platform is taught and supervised by a teacher licensed under subchapter VII, part 3, who has online learning experience and the course content meets the requirements established by rule pursuant to section 256.7, subsection 32, paragraph “c”. The department and the area education agencies operating online learning programs pursuant to section 273.16 shall coordinate to ensure the most effective use of resources and delivery of services. Federal funds, if available, may be used to offset what would otherwise be costs to school districts for participation in the program.\n\nd. For purposes of this subsection,“good faith effort” means the same as defined in section 279.19A, subsection 9.\n\n18. The board of directors of a school district and the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school shall each establish a policy to award credit toward graduation to a student if the student participates in the legislative page program at the state capitol for a regular session of the general assembly. The student shall be excused from the physical education requirements of subsection 5, paragraph “g”, subparagraph (1), and is exempt from the physical activity requirements of subsection 6, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2), while participating in the legislative page program. The student must complete the graduation requirements of section 256.7, subsection 26, paragraph “a”, but participation in the legislative page program for a complete regular session of the general assembly shall count as one-half unit of social studies credit required for purposes of section 256.7, subsection 26, paragraph “a”.\n\n19. For purposes of this section:\n\na. (1) “Age-appropriate” means topics, messages, and teaching methods suitable to particular ages or age groups of children and adolescents, based on developing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacity typical for the age or age group. “Age-appropriate” does not include any material with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act as defined in section 702.17.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), for purposes of the human growth and development curriculum, “age-appropriate” means the same as defined in section 279.50.\n\nb. “Research-based” means the same as defined in section 279.50.\n\n86 Acts, ch 1245, §1411; 87 Acts, ch 224, §26; 87 Acts, ch 233, §451; 88 Acts, ch 1018, §1, 2; 88 Acts, ch 1262, §1, 2; 89 Acts, ch 210, §4, 5; 89 Acts, ch 265, §23 – 26; 89 Acts, ch 278, §1, 2; 89 Acts, ch 319, §39, 40; 90 Acts, ch 1272, §32, 39, 40; 91 Acts, ch 104, §1; 91 Acts, ch 193, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1088, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1127, §1, 2; 92 Acts, ch 1159, §2; 92 Acts, ch 1163, §58; 93 Acts, ch 127, §1, 2; 94 Acts, ch 1091, §13; 94 Acts, ch 1152, §1; 2001 Acts, ch 56, §11; 2001 Acts, ch 159, §1 – 3; 2002 Acts, ch 1140, §7; 2004 Acts, ch 1027, §1; 2005 Acts, ch 3, §55; 2006 Acts, ch 1182, §2; 2007 Acts, ch 42, §1; 2007 Acts, ch 98, §2, 3; 2007 Acts, ch 108, §4; 2007 Acts, ch 148, §7; 2008 Acts, ch 1031, §42; 2008 Acts, ch 1187, §142, 145; 2009 Acts, ch 50, §1, 2; 2009 Acts, ch 57, §74; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2010 Acts, ch 1064, §1, 2; 2013 Acts, ch 121, §89; 2016 Acts, ch 1108, §26 – 28; 2016 Acts, ch 1138, §15, 24; 2017 Acts, ch 29, §58; 2018 Acts, ch 1083, §2; 2018 Acts, ch 1119, §20, 21; 2018 Acts, ch 1163, §10; 2019 Acts, ch 93, §1; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §37; 2020 Acts, ch 1107, §5; 2020 Acts, ch 1117, §9, 10; 2021 Acts, ch 88, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 105, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 134, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 139, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 170, §28; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §985, 2524, 2545 – 2547; 2023 Acts, ch 90, §11, 14, 16 – 20; 2023 Acts, ch 91, §1 – 4; 2023 Acts, ch 119, §25\n\nReferred to in §161A.7, 237.1, 237A.1, 256.7, 256.9, 256.10A, 256.11B, 256.125, 256.129, 256.130, 256.133, 256.136, 256.137, 256E.7, 257.11, 257.31, 261E.8, 261E.9, 261I.1, 273.2, 279.50, 279.50A, 279.61, 280.2, 280.3, 280A.1, 282.18, 282.34, 285.16, 298A.2, 299.2, 299.24, 422.7(22)(c), 422.11S, 422.12, 455E.8, 483A.27, 514C.35, 714.19\n\nCareer and technical agriculture education; §280.20\n\nSee Code editor’s note at the beginning of this Code volume\n\nUnnumbered paragraph 1 amended\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph a amended\n\nSubsections 2, 3, 4, 9, 9A, and 9B amended\n\nSubsection 5, paragraphs f, g, i, and k amended\n\nSubsection 5, paragraph h, subparagraph (2) amended\n\nSubsection 5, paragraph j, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nNEW subsections 5A and 19\n\nSubsection 17, paragraph a, subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (a) amended\n\nSubsection 17, paragraph c, subparagraphs (1) and (3) amended",

Courses made available to students in this manner shall be considered as compliance by the private schools in which the students are enrolled with any standards or laws requiring private schools to offer or teach the courses.\n\n2. a. This section does not deprive the respective boards of public school districts of any of their legal powers, statutory or otherwise, and in accepting the specially enrolled students, each of the boards shall prescribe the terms of the special enrollment, including but not limited to scheduling of courses and the length of class periods. In addition, the board of the affected public school district shall be given notice by the department of its decision to permit the special enrollment not later than six months prior to the opening of the affected public school district’s school year, except that the board of the public school district may waive the notice requirement.

Such preparation shall address all students, including but not limited to students with disabilities; students who are at risk of academic failure; students who have been identified as gifted and talented or English learners; and students with dyslexia, whether or not such students have been identified as children requiring special education under chapter 256B.\n\nb. Include in the professional education program, preparation that contributes to the education of students with disabilities and students who are gifted and talented, preparation in developing and implementing individualized education programs and behavioral intervention plans, preparation for educating individuals in the least restrictive environment and identifying that environment, strategies that address difficult and violent student behavior and improve academic engagement and achievement, and preparation in classroom management addressing high-risk behaviors including but not limited to behaviors related to substance use disorder. Preparation required under this paragraph must be successfully completed before graduation from the practitioner preparation program.\n\nc. Require that each student admitted to an approved practitioner preparation program participate in pre-student teaching field experiences that include both observation and participation in teaching activities in a variety of school settings. Pre-student teaching field experiences for students participating in an initial teacher preparation program shall comprise a total of at least eighty hours in duration, at least ten hours of which shall occur prior to a student’s acceptance in an approved practitioner preparation program. Pre-student teaching field experiences for students participating in a teacher intern preparation program shall comprise a total of at least fifty hours in duration. The student teaching experience shall be a minimum of fourteen weeks in duration during the student’s final year of the practitioner preparation program. The program shall make every reasonable effort to offer the student teaching experience prior to a student’s last semester, or equivalent, in the program, and to expand the student’s student teaching opportunities beyond one semester or the equivalent.\n\nd. Require that faculty members in professional education maintain an ongoing involvement in activities in elementary, middle, or secondary schools. The activities shall include at least forty hours of team teaching during a period not exceeding five years in duration at the elementary, middle, or secondary level.\n\ne.

Prescribe minimum experiences and responsibilities to be accomplished during the student teaching experience by the student teacher and by the cooperating teacher based upon recommendations of the department after consultation with teacher education faculty members in colleges and universities. The student teaching experience shall include opportunities for the student teacher to become knowledgeable about the Iowa teaching standards, including but not limited to a mock evaluation performed by the cooperating teacher. The mock evaluation shall not be used as an assessment tool by the practitioner preparation program. The student teaching experience shall consist of interactive experiences involving the college or university personnel, the student teacher, the cooperating teacher, and administrative personnel from the cooperating teacher’s school district.\n\ng.

In order to continue receipt of payments, a recipient shall annually recertify eligibility.\n\n2. a. If the amount appropriated annually for purposes of this section is insufficient to pay the full amount of reimbursement awards in accordance with subsection 1, paragraph “a”, the department shall annually prorate the amount of the registration awards provided to each teacher who meets the requirements of this section.\n\nb. If the amount appropriated annually for purposes of providing an annual award in accordance with subsection 1, paragraph “b”, is insufficient to pay the full annual award to all teachers approved by the department for an annual award, the department shall prorate the amount of the annual award based upon the amount appropriated.\n\n3.

The department shall prorate the amount of the annual awards paid in accordance with this section when the number of award recipients exceeds one thousand one hundred individuals. The department may prorate the amount of an annual award when a teacher who meets the qualifications of subsection 1 is employed on a less than full-time basis by a school district. The state board shall adopt rules under chapter 17A establishing criteria for the proration of annual awards.\n\n8. Notwithstanding section 8.33, funds appropriated for purposes of this section which remain unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated shall not revert but shall be available for expenditure for the following fiscal year for purposes of this section.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1216, §5; 99 Acts, ch 142, §1; 99 Acts, ch 205, §20; 2002 Acts, ch 1152, §3, 4; 2004 Acts, ch 1175, §90; 2005 Acts, ch 169, §20, 21; 2006 Acts, ch 1182, §4; 2007 Acts, ch 108, §6, 7; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2012 Acts, ch 1119, §29, 30\n\nReferred to in §284.13, 284.15\n\nSection not amended; internal reference change applied",
