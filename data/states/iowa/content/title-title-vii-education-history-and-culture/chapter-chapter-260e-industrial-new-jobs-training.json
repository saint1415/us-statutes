The refunding certificates may be exchanged in payment and discharge of the certificates being refunded, in installments at different times or an entire issue or series at one time. Refunding certificates may be sold or exchanged at any time on, before, or after the maturity of the outstanding certificates to be refunded, may be issued for the purpose of refunding a like, greater, or lesser principal amount of certificates and may bear a higher, lower, or equivalent rate of interest than the certificates being renewed or refunded.\n\n4. To further secure the payment of the certificates, the board of directors shall, by resolution, provide for the assessment of an annual levy of a standby tax upon all taxable property within the merged area. A copy of the resolution shall be sent to the county auditor of each county in which the merged area is located. The revenues from the standby tax shall be deposited in a special fund and shall be expended only for the payment of principal of and interest on the certificates issued as provided in this section, when the receipt of payment for program costs as provided in the agreement is insufficient. If payments are necessary and made from the special fund, the amount of the payments shall be promptly repaid into the special fund from the first available payments received for program costs as provided in the agreement which are not required for the payment of principal of or interest on certificates due. No reserves may be built up in this fund in anticipation of a projected default. The board of directors shall adjust the annual standby tax levy for each year to reflect the amount of revenues in the special fund and the amount of principal and interest which is due in that year.\n\n5. Before certificates are issued, the board of directors shall publish once a notice of its intention to issue the certificates, stating the amount, the purpose, and the project or projects for which the certificates are to be issued. A person may, within fifteen days after the publication of the notice by action in the district court of a county in the area within which the community college is located, appeal the decision of the board of directors in proposing to issue the certificates. The action of the board of directors in determining to issue the certificates is final and conclusive unless the district court finds that the board of directors has exceeded its legal authority. An action shall not be brought which questions the legality of the certificates, the power of the board of directors to issue the certificates, the effectiveness of any proceedings relating to the authorization of the project, or the authorization and issuance of the certificates from and after fifteen days from the publication of the notice of intention to issue.\n\n6. The board of directors shall determine if revenues are sufficient to secure the faithful performance of obligations in the agreement.\n\n83 Acts, ch 171, §6, 8\n\nCS83, §280B.6\n\n88 Acts, ch 1158, §58; 90 Acts, ch 1253, §81\n\nC93, §260E.6\n\nReferred to in §260C.58, 260E.2, 260J.1, 260J.2",
