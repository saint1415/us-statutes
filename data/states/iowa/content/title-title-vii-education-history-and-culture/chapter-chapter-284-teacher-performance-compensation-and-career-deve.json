A school district shall provide for an annual review of each teacher’s performance for purposes of assisting teachers in making continuous improvement, documenting continued competence in the Iowa teaching standards, identifying teachers in need of improvement, or to determine whether the teacher’s practice meets school district expectations for career advancement. The review shall include, at minimum, classroom observation of the teacher, the teacher’s progress, and implementation of the teacher’s individual professional development plan, subject to the level of resources provided to implement the plan; and shall include supporting documentation from parents, students, and other teachers. The first and second year of review shall be conducted by a peer group of teachers. The peer group shall review all of the peer group members. Peer group reviews shall be formative and shall be conducted on an informal, collaborative basis that is focused on assisting each peer group member in achieving the goals of the teacher’s individual professional development plan. Peer group reviews shall not be the basis for recommending that a teacher participate in an intensive assistance program, and shall not be used to determine the compensation, promotion, layoff, or termination of a teacher, or any other determination affecting a teacher’s employment status. However, as a result of a peer group review, a teacher may elect to participate in an intensive assistance program. Members of the peer group shall be reviewed every third year by at least one evaluator certified in accordance with section 284.10.\n\n2. If a supervisor or an evaluator determines, at any time, as a result of a teacher’s performance that the teacher is not meeting district expectations under the Iowa teaching standards specified in section 284.3, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” through “h”, and the criteria for the Iowa teaching standards developed by the department in accordance with section 256.9, subsection 42, the evaluator shall, at the direction of the teacher’s supervisor, recommend to the district that the teacher participate in an intensive assistance program. The intensive assistance program and its implementation are not subject to negotiation and grievance procedures established pursuant to chapter 20. All school districts shall be prepared to offer an intensive assistance program.\n\n3. A teacher who is not meeting the applicable standards and criteria based on a determination made pursuant to subsection 2 shall participate in an intensive assistance program. However, a teacher who has previously participated in an intensive assistance program relating to particular Iowa teaching standards or criteria shall not be entitled to participate in another intensive assistance program relating to the same standards or criteria and shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 4.\n\n4. Following a teacher’s participation in an intensive assistance program, the teacher shall be reevaluated to determine whether the teacher successfully completed the intensive assistance program and is meeting district expectations under the applicable Iowa teaching standards or criteria. If the teacher did not successfully complete the intensive assistance program or continues not to meet the applicable Iowa teaching standards or criteria, the board may do any of the following:\n\na. Terminate the teacher’s contract immediately pursuant to section 279.27.\n\nb. Terminate the teacher’s contract at the end of the school year pursuant to section 279.15.\n\nc. Continue the teacher’s contract for a period not to exceed one year.

      "text": "284.11 State supplemental assistance for high-need schools.\n\n1. Findings and intent. The general assembly finds that students whose first language is not English, who have special needs, or who come from low-income backgrounds face potential obstacles to learning. Schools across Iowa, both urban and rural, have increasing numbers of students who face these challenges. Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly to provide supplemental assistance to the highest-need schools in Iowa to address these challenges. This section provides for state assistance to allow school districts to develop extended learning time programs, hire instructional support staff, provide additional professional development, or supplement the salary of teachers in the identified schools.\n\n2. Department’s responsibilities. The department shall do the following:\n\na. Collect relevant data and establish a list of high-need schools eligible for state supplemental assistance. The department shall establish a process and criteria to determine which schools are placed on the list and the department shall revise the list annually. Criteria for the determination of which high-need schools shall be placed on the list shall be based upon factors that include but are not limited to the socioeconomic status of the students enrolled in the school, the percentage of the school’s student body who are English learners, student academic growth, certified instructional staff attrition, and geographic balance. The department may approve or disapprove requests for revision of the list, which a school district submits pursuant to subsection 3.\n\nb. Develop a standardized process for distributing moneys appropriated for supplemental assistance for high-need schools under section 284.13, subsection 1, paragraph “g”, to school districts. In determining the process for distribution of such moneys, the department shall take into consideration the amount of moneys appropriated for supplemental assistance in high-need schools for the given year and the minimal amount of moneys needed to increase the academic achievement of students. A school district receiving moneys pursuant to this section shall certify annually to the department how the moneys distributed to the school district pursuant to this section were used by the school district.\n\nc. Review the use and effectiveness of the funds distributed to school districts for supplemental assistance in high-need schools under this section, and consider the findings and recommendations of the commission on educator leadership and compensation submitted pursuant to section 284.15, subsection 13, relating to the use and effectiveness of the funds distributed to school districts under this section. The department shall submit its findings and recommendations in a report to the general assembly by January 15 annually.\n\n3. School district request for approval. A school district may request on an annual basis approval from the department for additions to the list of high-need schools the department maintains pursuant to subsection 2 based upon the unique local conditions and needs of the school district. The criteria used to determine the placement of high-need schools on the list in accordance with subsection 2 does not restrict the department from adding a high-need school to the list as requested by a school district on the basis of unique local conditions and needs pursuant to this subsection.\n\n4. Moneys received and miscellaneous income. The distribution of moneys allocated pursuant to section 284.13, subsection 1, paragraph “g”, to a school district shall be made in one payment on or about October 15 of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made, taking into consideration the relative budget and cash position of the state resources. Such moneys shall not be commingled with state aid payments made under section 257.16 to a school district and shall be accounted for by the local school district separately from state aid payments. Payments made to school districts under this section are miscellaneous income for purposes of chapter 257. A school district shall maintain a separate listing within its budget for payments received and expenditures made pursuant to this section.\n\n5. Moneys received to supplement salaries. Moneys received by a school district pursuant to section 284.13, subsection 1, paragraph “g”, shall be used to supplement and not supplant the salary being received by a teacher in a high-need school, and shall not be considered under chapter 20 by an arbitrator or other third party in determining a comparison of the wages of teachers in that high-need school with the wages of teachers in other buildings or in another school district.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 121, §66; 2022 Acts, ch 1011, §11\n\nReferred to in §284.13, 284.15",
