The establishment of the authority is in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state of Iowa, for the improvement of their education, health and welfare, and for the promotion of the economy, which are public purposes.\n\n2. The authority will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the powers and duties conferred upon it by this chapter.\n\n3. There exists a serious problem in this state regarding the ability of students to obtain financing for the cost of education beyond the high school level.\n\n4. Escalating costs of securing such an education have contributed to the difficulties faced by students in attempting to finance an education.\n\n5. Without public action as contemplated by this chapter, many students will be forced to postpone or abandon plans for obtaining additional education.\n\n6. It is in the interests and welfare of the citizens of the state to provide a means for assisting students to continue their education.\n\n7. Without public action as contemplated by this chapter, the inability to obtain educational financing will result in declining enrollments at institutions of higher education.\n\n8. It is necessary to create a higher education loan authority to encourage the investment of private capital in the provision of funds for the financing of student loans.\n\n9. All of the purposes stated in this section are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted.\n\n[82 Acts, ch 1031, §3]\n\nReferred to in §261A.24",

The authority may provide by resolution for the issuance of obligations for the purpose of paying, refinancing, or reimbursing all or part of the cost of a project. Except to the extent payable from payments to be made on federally guaranteed securities as provided in section 261A.45, the principal of and the interest on the obligations shall be payable solely out of the revenue of the authority derived from the project to which they relate and from other facilities pledged or made available for this purpose by the institution for whose benefit the obligations were issued. The obligations of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at rate or rates, without regard to any limit contained in any other statute or law of the state, and shall mature at times not exceeding forty years from the date of issuance, all as determined by the authority; and may be made redeemable before maturity at the prices and under terms fixed by the authority in the authorizing resolution.\n\n2. Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the obligations are to be paid solely out of the revenue of the project to which they relate and, in certain instances, out of the revenue of certain other facilities, and subject to section 261A.45 with respect to a pledge of government securities, the obligations may be unsecured or secured in the manner and to the extent determined by the authority. The authority shall determine the form of the obligations, including interest coupons, if any, to be attached, and shall fix the denominations of the obligations and the places of payment of principal and interest which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The obligations and coupons attached, if any, shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of officers of the authority designated by the authority. If an official of the authority whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any obligations or coupons ceases to be an official before the delivery of the obligations, the signature or facsimile, nevertheless, is valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the individual had remained an official of the authority until delivery. Obligations issued under this subchapter have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments, notwithstanding this payment from limited sources and without regard to any other law. The obligations may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, and one form may be exchangeable for the other in the manner as the authority may determine. Provision may be made for the registration of any coupon obligations as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon obligations of any obligations registered as to both principal and interest. The obligations may be sold in the manner, either at public or private sale, as the authority determines.\n\n3. The proceeds of the obligations of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project for which the obligations have been issued, and shall be disbursed in the manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the authority provides in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the obligations or in the trust agreement provided for in section 261A.44 securing the obligations. If the proceeds of the obligations of an issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, are less than the costs, additional obligations may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the obligations or in the trust agreement securing them, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the obligations first issued. If the proceeds of the obligations of an issue shall exceed the cost of the project for which the same shall have been issued, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for the obligations. Prior to the preparation of definitive obligations, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary obligations, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive obligations when the obligations have been executed and are available for delivery.\n\n4. The authority may also provide for the replacement of obligations which become mutilated or are destroyed or lost. Obligations may be issued under this subchapter without obtaining the consent of an officer, department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state, and without other proceedings or conditions other than those which are specifically required by this subchapter. The authority may purchase its bonds out of funds available for that purpose. The authority may hold, pledge, cancel, or resell the obligations, subject to and in accordance with any agreement with the obligation holders. Members of the authority and any person executing the obligations are not liable personally on the obligations or subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the obligations.\n\n85 Acts, ch 210, §12; 97 Acts, ch 181, §5; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §76",
