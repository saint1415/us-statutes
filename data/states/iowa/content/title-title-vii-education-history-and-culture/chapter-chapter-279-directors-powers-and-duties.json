If a student is not reading proficiently and is persistently at risk in reading, based upon the assessments administered in accordance with this paragraph, the school district shall provide intensive reading instruction to the student. The student’s reading proficiency shall be periodically reassessed by locally determined or statewide assessments including periodic universal screening and annual standard-based assessments. The student shall continue to be provided with intensive reading instruction, at grade levels beyond grade three if necessary, until the student is reading at grade level, as determined by the student’s consistently proficient performance on valid and reliable measures of reading ability. For purposes of this section, “persistently at risk” means the student has not met the grade-level benchmark on two consecutive screening assessments administered under this paragraph.\n\nb. The parent or guardian of any student in kindergarten through grade three who is persistently at risk in reading shall be notified in writing and shall be provided all of the following:\n\n(1) A description of the services currently provided to the student.\n\n(2) A description of the proposed supplemental instructional services and supports that the school district will provide to the student that are designed to remediate the identified areas in which the student is persistently at risk in reading.\n\n(3) Strategies for parents and guardians to use in helping the student read proficiently, including but not limited to the promotion of parent-guided home reading.\n\n(4) Regular updates regarding the student’s progress toward reaching or exceeding the targeted level of reading proficiency.\n\n2. Successful progression for early readers. If funds are appropriated by the general assembly for purposes of implementing this subsection, a school district shall do all of the following:\n\na. Provide students who are persistently at risk in reading with intensive instructional services and supports, free of charge, to remediate the identified areas in which students are not proficient in reading, including a minimum of ninety minutes daily of scientific, research-based reading instruction and other strategies prescribed by the school district which may include but are not limited to the following:\n\n(1) Small group instruction.\n\n(2) Reduced teacher-student ratios.\n\n(3) More frequent progress monitoring.\n\n(4) Tutoring or mentoring.\n\n(5) Extended school day, week, or year.\n\n(6) Summer reading programs.\n\nb. At regular intervals, apprise the parent or guardian of academic and other progress being made by the student and give the parent or guardian other useful information.\n\nc. In addition to required reading enhancement and acceleration strategies, provide parents of students who are persistently at risk in reading with a plan outlined in a parental contract, including participation in regular parent-guided home reading.\n\nd. Establish a reading enhancement and acceleration development initiative designed to offer intensive accelerated reading instruction to each kindergarten through grade three student who is persistently at risk in reading. The initiative shall comply with all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Be provided to all kindergarten through grade three students who are persistently at risk in reading. The assessment initiative shall measure phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.\n\n(2) Be provided during regular school hours in addition to the regular reading instruction.\n\n(3) Provide a reading curriculum that meets guidelines adopted pursuant to section 256.7, subsection 31, and at a minimum has the following specifications:\n\n(a) Assists students who are persistently at risk in reading to develop the skills to read at grade level. Assistance shall include but not be limited to strategies that formally address dyslexia, when appropriate. For purposes of this subparagraph division (a),“dyslexia” means a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin, is characterized by difficulties with accurate or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities, and may include difficulties that typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction, as well as secondary consequences such as problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.\n\n(b) Provides skill development in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.\n\n(c) Includes a scientifically based and reliable assessment.\n\n(d) Provides initial and ongoing analysis of each student’s reading progress.\n\n(e) Is implemented during regular school hours.\n\n(f) Provides a curriculum in core academic subjects to assist the student in maintaining or meeting proficiency levels for the appropriate grade in all academic subjects.\n\ne. Report to the department of education the specific intensive reading interventions and supports implemented by the school district pursuant to this section. The department shall annually prescribe the components of required or requested reports.\n\n3. Ensuring continuous improvement in reading proficiency.\n\na. To ensure all children are reading proficiently by the end of third grade, each school district shall address reading proficiency, drawing upon information about students from assessments and reassessments conducted pursuant to subsection 1 and the prevalence of areas in which students are persistently at risk in reading identified by classroom, elementary school, and other student characteristics. Each school district shall review chronic early elementary absenteeism for its impact on literacy development. If more than fifteen percent of an attendance center’s students are not reading proficiently and are persistently at risk in reading by the end of third grade, the school district shall develop and implement strategies to reduce that percentage, including school and community strategies to raise the percentage of students who are reading at grade level.\n\nb.

A parent or guardian of a student enrolled in a school district may enroll the student in another attendance center within the same school district that offers classes at the student’s grade level in the manner provided in this section if, as a result of viewing a recording created by a video surveillance system or a report from a school district employee, and consistent with the requirements of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. §1232g, and any regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, the school district determines that any student enrolled in the school district has harassed or bullied the student. For purposes of this subsection, “harassment” and “bullying” mean the same as defined in section 280.28.\n\n2. a. A parent or guardian shall send notification to the school district, on forms prescribed by the department of education, that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in another attendance center within the same school district that offers classes at the student’s grade level.\n\nb. The school district shall enroll the student in another attendance center within the same school district unless the attendance center has insufficient classroom space for the student. If the request is granted, the school district shall transmit a copy of the form to the parent or guardian within five days after the school district’s action. The parent or guardian may withdraw the request at any time prior to the school district’s action on the request. A denial of a request by the school district may be appealed to the board of directors of the school district.\n\nc. The board of directors of each school district shall adopt a policy that defines the term “insufficient classroom space” for that district.\n\n3. A request under this section is for a period of not less than one year. A student who attends school in another attendance center pursuant to this section may return to the original attendance center and enroll at any time, once the parent or guardian has notified the school district in writing of the decision to enroll the student in the original attendance center.\n\n4. If a request filed under this section is for a student requiring special education under chapter 256B, the request to transfer to another attendance center shall only be granted if all of the following conditions are met:\n\na. The attendance center maintains a special education instructional program that is appropriate to meet the student’s educational needs and the enrollment of the student in the attendance center would not cause the size of the class or caseload in that special education instructional program in the attendance center to exceed the maximum class size or caseload established pursuant to rules adopted by the state board of education.\n\nb. If the student would be assigned to a general education class, there is sufficient classroom space for the general education class to which the student would be assigned.\n\n5. If a student, for whom a request to transfer has been filed with the school district, has been suspended or expelled in the school district, the student shall not be permitted to transfer until the student has been reinstated. Once the student has been reinstated, however, the student shall be permitted to transfer in the same manner as if the student had not been suspended or expelled. If a student, for whom a request to transfer has been filed with a school district, is expelled in the school district, the student shall be permitted to transfer under this section if the student applies for and is reinstated. However, if the student applies for reinstatement but is not reinstated in the school district, the school district may deny the request to transfer. The decision of the school district may be appealed to the board of directors of the school district.\n\n6. A student who is enrolled in another attendance center within the same school district pursuant to this section is eligible to participate immediately in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and athletic competitions as a member of a team from the receiving attendance center.\n\n7. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a school district from allowing the parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school district to enroll the student in another attendance center within the same school district that offers classes at the student’s grade level pursuant to a policy adopted by the board of directors of the school district that allows for transfers for reasons in addition to those allowed pursuant to this section.\n\n8.
