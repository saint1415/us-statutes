      "text": "257.1 State school foundation program — state aid.\n\n1. Program established. A state school foundation program is established for the school year commencing July 1, 1991, and succeeding school years.\n\n2. State school foundation aid — foundation base.\n\na. For a budget year, each school district in the state is entitled to receive foundation aid, in an amount per pupil equal to the difference between the amount per pupil of foundation property tax in the district, and the combined foundation base per pupil or the combined district cost per pupil, whichever is less. However, if the amount of foundation aid received by a school district under this chapter is less than three hundred dollars per pupil, the district is entitled to receive three hundred dollars per pupil unless the receipt of three hundred dollars per pupil plus the per pupil amount raised by the foundation property tax exceeds the combined district cost per pupil of the district for the budget year. In that case, the district is entitled to receive an amount per pupil equal to the difference between the per pupil amount raised by the foundation property tax for the budget year and the combined district cost per pupil for the budget year.\n\nb. For the budget year commencing July 1, 1999, and for each succeeding budget year beginning before July 1, 2022, the regular program foundation base per pupil is eighty-seven and five-tenths percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. For the budget year commencing July 1, 2022, and for each succeeding budget year, the regular program foundation base per pupil is eighty-eight and four-tenths percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. For the budget year commencing July 1, 1991, and for each succeeding budget year the special education support services foundation base is seventy-nine percent of the special education support services state cost per pupil. The combined foundation base is the sum of the regular program foundation base, the special education support services foundation base, the total teacher salary supplement district cost, the total professional development supplement district cost, the total early intervention supplement district cost, the total teacher leadership supplement district cost, the total area education agency teacher salary supplement district cost, and the total area education agency professional development supplement district cost.\n\n3. Computations rounded. In making computations and payments under this chapter, except in the case of computations relating to funding of special education support services, media services, and educational services provided through the area education agencies, and the teacher salary supplement, the professional development supplement, the early intervention supplement, and the teacher leadership supplement, the department of management shall round amounts to the nearest whole dollar.\n\n4. Legislative review. The provisions of this chapter shall be subject to legislative review at least every five years. The review shall be based upon a school finance formula status report containing the recommendations of a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review of the school finance formula, to be prepared with the assistance of the department of education, in association with the departments of management and revenue. The report shall include recommendations for school finance formula changes or revisions based upon demographic changes, enrollment trends, and property tax valuation fluctuations observed during the preceding five-year interval; an analysis of the operation of the school finance formula during the preceding five-year interval; and a summary of issues that have arisen since the previous review and potential approaches for their resolution. The first such report shall be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1, 2005, with subsequent reports developed and submitted by January 1 at least every fifth year thereafter.\n\n89 Acts, ch 135, §1; 91 Acts, ch 267, §517; 95 Acts, ch 130, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1197, §5, 6; 99 Acts, ch 2, §1, 4; 99 Acts, ch 178, §1, 10; 2000 Acts, ch 1186, §2; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2008 Acts, ch 1181, §93, 94; 2013 Acts, ch 121, §49, 50; 2016 Acts, ch 1036, §3; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §121\n\nReferred to in §257.3, 257.4, 257.12, 257.15, 257.16B, 257.16D, 257.34",

The rate of the additional property tax levy in a school district shall be determined by the department of management and shall be calculated to raise the difference between the combined district cost for the budget year and the sum of the following:\n\n(1) The product of the regular program foundation base per pupil times the weighted enrollment in the district.\n\n(2) The product of special education support services foundation base per pupil times the special education support services weighted enrollment in the district.\n\n(3) The total teacher salary supplement district cost.\n\n(4) The total professional development supplement district cost.\n\n(5) The total early intervention supplement district cost.\n\n(6) The total area education agency teacher salary supplement district cost.\n\n(7) The total area education agency professional development supplement district cost.\n\n(8) The amount of the school district property tax replacement payment to be received by the school district under section 257.16B.\n\n(9) The total teacher leadership supplement district cost.\n\n(10) The amount of the foundation base supplement payment to be received by the school district under section 257.16D.\n\nb. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2008, and succeeding budget years, the department of management shall annually determine an adjusted additional property tax levy and a statewide maximum adjusted additional property tax levy rate, not to exceed the statewide average additional property tax levy rate, calculated by dividing the total adjusted additional property tax levy dollars statewide by the statewide total net taxable valuation. For purposes of this paragraph, the adjusted additional property tax levy shall be that portion of the additional property tax levy corresponding to the state cost per pupil multiplied by a school district’s weighted enrollment, and then multiplied by one hundred percent less the regular program foundation base per pupil percentage pursuant to section 257.1, and then reduced by the amount of the property tax replacement payment to be received under section 257.16B and the amount of the foundation base supplement payment to be received under section 257.16D. The district shall receive adjusted additional property tax levy aid in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted additional property tax levy rate and the statewide maximum adjusted additional property tax levy rate, as applied per thousand dollars of assessed valuation on all taxable property in the district. The statewide maximum adjusted additional property tax levy rate shall be annually determined by the department taking into account amounts allocated pursuant to section 257.15, subsection 4, and the balance of the property tax equity and relief fund created in section 257.16A at the end of the calendar year.\n\n2. Supplemental aid.\n\na. However, if the rate of the additional property tax levy determined under subsection 1 with the application of section 257.15 for a budget year for a reorganized school district is higher than the rate of additional property tax levy determined under subsection 1 with the application of section 257.15 for the year previous to the reorganization for a school district that had a certified enrollment of less than six hundred and that was within the school districts affected by the reorganization as defined in section 275.1, the department of management shall reduce the rate of the additional property tax levy in the portion of the reorganized district where the new rate is higher, to the rate that was levied in that portion of the district during the year preceding the reorganization, for a five-year period. The department of management shall include in the state aid payments made to each reorganized school district under section 257.16 during each of the first five years of existence of the reorganized district as supplemental aid, moneys equal to the reduction in property tax revenues made under this subsection. For the budget year beginning July 1, 1991, the base year calculation shall be made using chapter 442, Code 1991.\n\nb. For purposes of this section, a reorganized school district is one in which action to bring about a reorganization was initiated by a vote of the board of directors or jointly by the affected boards of directors prior to November 30, 1990, and the reorganization will take effect on or after July 1, 1991, and on or before July 1, 1993. Each district which initiated, by a vote of the board of directors or jointly by the affected boards, action to bring about a reorganization or dissolution by November 30, 1990, shall certify the date and the nature of the action taken to the department of education by September 1, 1991.\n\n3. Application of tax. No later than June 15 of each year, the department of management shall notify the county auditor of each county the amount, in dollars and cents per thousand dollars of assessed value, of the additional property tax levy in each school district in the county.

Tuition charges to the parent or guardian of a shared-time or part-time nonresident pupil shall be reduced by the amount of any increased state aid received by the district by the counting of the pupil. This subparagraph applies to pupils enrolled in grades nine through twelve under section 299A.8 and to pupils from accredited nonpublic schools accessing classes or services on the accredited nonpublic school premises under section 256.12 or on the school district site, but excludes accredited nonpublic school pupils receiving classes or services funded entirely by federal grants or allocations.\n\n(4) Eleventh and twelfth grade nonresident pupils who were residents of the district during the preceding school year and are enrolled in the district until the pupils graduate.

If the school district determines that the expenditures associated with providing competent private instruction pursuant to chapter 299A are in excess of the revenue attributed to the school district’s weighted enrollment for such instruction in accordance with this subparagraph, the school district may submit a request to the school budget review committee for a modified supplemental amount in accordance with section 257.31, subsection 5, paragraph “n”. A home school assistance program shall not provide moneys received pursuant to this subparagraph, nor resources paid for with moneys received pursuant to this subparagraph, to parents or students utilizing the program.

Budget enrollment. Budget enrollment for the budget year is the basic enrollment for the budget year.\n\n5. Weighted enrollment.\n\na. Weighted enrollment is the budget enrollment plus the district’s additional enrollment because of special education calculated by November 1 of the base year plus additional pupils added due to the application of the supplementary weighting.\n\nb.

(1) The unadjusted teacher leadership supplement district cost is the teacher leadership supplement district cost per pupil for each school district for a budget year multiplied by the sum of the budget enrollment for that school district plus the number of resident pupils in the school district that received an education savings account payment under section 257.11B for the base year.\n\n(2) The total teacher leadership supplement district cost is the sum of the unadjusted teacher leadership supplement district cost plus the budget adjustment for that budget year.\n\nd. Except as otherwise allowed under this paragraph, for the budget year beginning July 1, 2014, and succeeding budget years, the use of the funds calculated under this subsection shall comply with the requirements of chapter 284 and shall be distributed to teachers pursuant to section 284.15. The funds shall be used only to increase the payment for a teacher assigned to a leadership role pursuant to a framework or comparable system approved pursuant to section 284.15; to increase the percentages of teachers assigned to leadership roles; to increase the minimum teacher starting salary to thirty-three thousand five hundred dollars; to cover the costs for the time mentor and lead teachers are not providing instruction to students in a classroom; for coverage of a classroom when an initial or career teacher is observing or co-teaching with a teacher assigned to a leadership role; for professional development time to learn best practices associated with the career pathways leadership process; and for other costs associated with a framework or comparable system approved by the department of education under section 284.15 with the goals of improving instruction and elevating the quality of teaching and student learning. If all requirements for the school district for the use of funds calculated under this subsection are met and funds received under this subsection remain unexpended and unobligated at the end of a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2020, the school district may transfer all or a portion of such unexpended and unobligated funds for deposit in the school district’s flexibility account established under section 298A.2, subsection 2. At the end of a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2022, school districts may use all or a portion of funds under this subsection for the purposes authorized under subsection 9, paragraph “d”, and, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, school districts shall not be required to participate in or comply with section 284.15 in order to continue to receive funding under this subsection.\n\n13. Deference to school districts.\n\na. When exercising authority to carry out an agency action, as defined in section 17A.2, or to perform an activity or make a decision specified in section 17A.2, subsection 11, paragraphs “a” through “l”, if applicable, related to the provisions of subsections 9, 10, and 11, including the expenditure of funds received by school districts under subsections 9, 10, and 11, the department of education, the director of the department of education, and the state board of education shall carry out, perform, or make such agency action, activity, or decision in a manner that gives deference to decisions of school districts’ boards of directors, promotes flexibility for school districts, and minimizes intrusions into school district operations and decision making by boards of directors.\n\nb. (1) In addition to paragraph “a”, the department of education, the director of the department of education, and the state board of education shall not issue guidance related to the provisions of subsections 9, 10, and 11, including the expenditure of funds received by a school district under subsections 9, 10, and 11, that is inconsistent with any statute, rule, or other legal authority or that imposes any legally binding obligations or duties upon any person unless such legally binding obligations or duties are required or reasonably implied by any statute, rule, or other legal authority. Guidance issued in violation of this paragraph “b” shall not be deemed to be legally binding.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this paragraph “b”, “guidance” means a document or statement issued by the department of education, the director of the department of education, or the state board of education that purports to interpret a law, a rule, or other legal authority and is designed to provide advice or direction to a person regarding the implementation of or compliance with the law, the rule, or the other legal authority being interpreted. “Guidance” does not include any action, activity, or decision governed by paragraph “a”, a document or statement required by federal law or a court, or a document or statement issued in the course of a contested case proceeding, an administrative proceeding, or a judicial proceeding to which the department, the state board, or the director is a party.\n\n89 Acts, ch 135, §10; 90 Acts, ch 1190, §4 – 6; 90 Acts, ch 1272, §44; 99 Acts, ch 178, §3, 10; 2006 Acts, ch 1152, §24; 2008 Acts, ch 1181, §98, 99; 2009 Acts, ch 68, §3, 4; 2009 Acts, ch 177, §17, 18; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §44; 2013 Acts, ch 121, §19 – 25, 42, 54, 55; 2014 Acts, ch 1013, §4; 2015 Acts, ch 140, §36, 58, 59; 2017 Acts, ch 153, §9 – 11; 2017 Acts, ch 154, §2; 2018 Acts, ch 1007, §4 – 6; 2018 Acts, ch 1112, §2, 16, 17; 2021 Acts, ch 139, §2; 2023 Acts, ch 1, §3 – 6, 10, 12 – 14, 18\n\nReferred to in §256F.4, 257.2, 257.8, 257.16, 257.46, 282.24, 284.3A, 284.4, 284.6, 284.15, 284.16, 284.17, 298A.2\n\nSubsection 9, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 9, paragraph d amended\n\nSubsection 10, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 10, paragraph d amended\n\nSubsection 11, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 12, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 12, paragraph d amended",

      "text": "257.11 Supplementary weighting plan.\n\n1. Regular curriculum. Pupils in a regular curriculum attending all their classes in the district in which they reside, taught by teachers employed by that district, and having administrators employed by that district, are assigned a weighting of one.\n\n2. District-to-district sharing.\n\na. In order to provide additional funds for school districts which send their resident pupils to another school district, which jointly employ and share the services of teachers under section 280.15, or which use the services of a teacher employed by another school district, a supplementary weighting plan for determining enrollment is adopted.\n\nb. If the school budget review committee certifies to the department of management that the shared classes or teachers would otherwise not be implemented without the assignment of additional weighting, pupils attending classes in another school district, attending classes taught by a teacher who is employed jointly under section 280.15, or attending classes taught by a teacher who is employed by another school district are assigned a weighting of forty-eight hundredths of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends classes in another district, attends classes taught by a teacher who is jointly employed under section 280.15, or attends classes taught by a teacher who is employed by another school district.\n\nc. Pupils attending class for all or a substantial portion of a school day pursuant to a whole grade sharing agreement executed under sections 282.10 through 282.12 shall be eligible for supplementary weighting pursuant to this subsection. A school district which executes a whole grade sharing agreement and which adopts a resolution jointly with other affected boards to study the question of undergoing a reorganization or dissolution to take effect on or before July 1, 2024, shall receive a weighting of one-tenth of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends classes in another district, attends classes taught by a teacher who is jointly employed under section 280.15, or attends classes taught by a teacher who is employed by another school district. A district shall be eligible for supplementary weighting pursuant to this paragraph for a maximum of three years. Receipt of supplementary weighting for a second and third year shall be conditioned upon submission of information resulting from the study to the school budget review committee indicating progress toward the objective of reorganization on or before July 1, 2024.\n\nd. A school district which hosts a regional academy shall be eligible to assign its resident students attending classes at the academy a weighting of one-tenth of the percentage of the student’s school day during which the student attends classes at the regional academy. The maximum amount of additional weighting for which a school district hosting a regional academy shall be eligible is an amount corresponding to thirty additional students. The minimum amount of additional weighting for which a school district establishing a regional academy shall be eligible is an amount corresponding to fifteen additional students if the academy provides both advanced-level courses and career and technical courses.\n\n3. District-to-community college sharing and concurrent enrollment programs.\n\na. In order to provide additional funds for school districts which send their resident high school pupils to a community college for college-level classes, a supplementary weighting plan for determining enrollment is adopted.\n\nb. If the school budget review committee certifies to the department of management that the class would not otherwise be implemented without the assignment of additional weighting, pupils attending a community college-offered class or attending a class taught by a community college-employed instructor are assigned a weighting of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends class in the community college or attends a class taught by a community college-employed instructor times seventy hundredths for career and technical courses or fifty hundredths for liberal arts and sciences courses. The following requirements shall be met for the purposes of assigning an additional weighting for classes offered through a sharing agreement between a school district and community college. The class must be:\n\n(1) Supplementing, not supplanting, high school courses required to be offered pursuant to section 256.11, subsection 5.\n\n(2) Included in the community college catalog or an amendment or addendum to the catalog.\n\n(3) Open to all registered community college students, not just high school students. The class may be offered in a high school attendance center.\n\n(4) For college credit and the credit must apply toward an associate of arts or associate of science degree, or toward an associate of applied arts or associate of applied science degree, or toward completion of a college diploma program.\n\n(5) Taught by an instructor employed or contracted by a community college who meets the requirements of section 261E.3, subsection 2.\n\n(6) Taught utilizing the community college course syllabus.\n\n(7) Taught in such a manner as to result in student work and student assessment which meet college-level expectations.\n\nc. Notwithstanding paragraph “b”, subparagraph (1), a school district that otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection may enter into a sharing agreement with a community college under which the community college may offer, or provide a community college-employed instructor to teach, one of the science or one of the mathematics units in accordance with section 256.11, subsection 5, and one or more units in only one of the six career and technical education service areas in accordance with section 256.11, subsection 5, paragraph “h”. Pupils enrolled in a unit in accordance with this paragraph shall be assigned additional weighting in accordance with this subsection if the number of pupils enrolled in such a unit exceeds five and the school district’s total enrollment does not exceed six hundred pupils. A school district that enters into a sharing agreement with a community college under this paragraph to provide a unit of science or mathematics in accordance with section 256.11, subsection 5, paragraph “a”, “d”, or “e”, shall be deemed to have met the requirement that the school district offer and teach such a unit under the educational standards of section 256.11, subsection 5, paragraph “a”, “d”, or “e”. However, the provisions of this paragraph “c” relating to a sharing agreement for a unit of science or mathematics are applicable only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The school district has made every reasonable and good faith effort to employ a teacher licensed under chapter 256, subchapter VII, part 3, for the science or mathematics unit, as applicable, and is unable to employ such a teacher. For purposes of this paragraph “c”, “good faith effort” means the same as defined in section 279.19A, subsection 9.\n\n(2) Enrollment for the unit exceeds five pupils.\n\n(3) The unit is offered during the regular school day.\n\n(4) The unit is made accessible by the school district to all eligible pupils.\n\n4. At-risk programs and alternative schools.\n\na. In order to provide additional funding to school districts for programs serving at-risk pupils, alternative program and alternative school pupils in secondary schools, and pupils identified as potential dropouts or returning dropouts as defined in section 257.39, a supplementary weighting plan for such pupils is adopted. A supplementary weighting of forty-eight ten-thousandths per pupil shall be assigned to the percentage of pupils in a school district enrolled in grades one through six, as reported by the school district on the basic educational data survey for the base year, who are eligible for free and reduced price meals under the federal National School Lunch Act and the federal Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. §1751-1785, multiplied by the budget enrollment in the school district; and a supplementary weighting of one hundred fifty-six one-hundred-thousandths per pupil shall be assigned to pupils included in the budget enrollment of the school district. Amounts received as supplementary weighting under this subsection shall be utilized by a school district to develop or maintain at-risk pupils’ programs, alternative programs and alternative school programs, and returning dropout and dropout prevention programs approved pursuant to section 257.40.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, a school district which received supplementary weighting for an alternative high school program for the school budget year beginning July 1, 1999, shall receive an amount of supplementary weighting for the next three school budget years as follows:\n\n(1) For the budget year beginning July 1, 2000, the greater of the amount of supplementary weighting determined pursuant to paragraph “a”, or sixty-five percent of the amount received for the budget year beginning July 1, 1999.\n\n(2) For the budget year beginning July 1, 2001, the greater of the amount of supplementary weighting determined pursuant to paragraph “a”, or forty percent of the amount received for the budget year beginning July 1, 1999.\n\n(3) For the budget year beginning July 1, 2002, and succeeding budget years, the amount of supplementary weighting determined pursuant to paragraph “a”.\n\nc. If a school district receives an amount pursuant to paragraph “b” which exceeds the amount the district would otherwise have received pursuant to paragraph “a”, the department of management shall annually determine the amount of the excess that would have been state aid and the amount that would have been property tax if the school district had generated that amount pursuant to paragraph “a”, and shall include the amounts in the state aid payments and property tax levies of school districts. The department of management shall recalculate the supplementary weighting amount received each year to reflect the amount of the reduction in funding from one budget year to the next pursuant to paragraph “b”, subparagraphs (1) through (3). It is the intent of the general assembly that when weights are recalculated under this subsection, the total amounts generated by each weight shall be approximately equal.\n\nd. Amounts that a school district receives as supplementary weighting pursuant to this subsection or as a modified supplemental amount received under section 257.41 may be used in the budget year for purposes of providing district-wide, building-wide, or grade-specific at-risk and dropout prevention programming targeted to pupils who are not deemed at risk.\n\ne. Notwithstanding paragraph “d” and section 282.24, if a pupil has been determined by the school district to be likely to inflict self-harm or likely to harm another pupil and all of the following apply, the school district may use amounts received pursuant to paragraph “a” to pay the instructional costs necessary to address the pupil’s behavior during instructional time when those services are not otherwise provided to pupils who do not require special education and the costs exceed the costs of instruction of pupils in a regular curriculum:\n\n(1) The pupil does not require special education.\n\n(2) The pupil is not in a court-ordered placement under chapter 232 under the care and custody of the department of health and human services or juvenile court services.\n\n(3) The pupil is not in the state training school pursuant to a court order entered under chapter 232 under the care and custody of the department of health and human services.\n\n(4) The pupil is not placed in a facility licensed under chapter 135B, 135C, or 135H.\n\n5. Shared operational functions — increased student opportunities — budget years beginning in 2014 through 2034.\n\na. (1) In order to provide additional funding to increase student opportunities and redirect more resources to student programming for school districts that share operational functions, a district that shares with a political subdivision one or more operational functions of a curriculum director, master social worker, independent social worker, work-based learning coordinator, special education director, mental health professional who holds a statement of recognition issued by the board of educational examiners, college and career transition counselor or coordinator, school resource officer, or school counselor, or one or more operational functions in the areas of superintendent management, business management, human resources, transportation, or operation and maintenance for at least twenty percent of the school year shall be assigned a supplementary weighting for each shared operational function. A school district that shares an operational function in the area of superintendent management shall be assigned a supplementary weighting of nine pupils for the function. A school district that shares an operational function in the area of business management, human resources, transportation, or operation and maintenance shall be assigned a supplementary weighting of five pupils for the function. A school district that shares the operational functions of a curriculum director; a master social worker or an independent social worker licensed under chapters 147 and 154C; a work-based learning coordinator; a special education director; a mental health professional who holds a statement of recognition issued by the board of educational examiners; a college and career transition counselor or coordinator; a school resource officer; or a school counselor shall be assigned a supplementary weighting of three pupils for the function. The additional weighting shall be assigned for each discrete operational function shared. However, a school district may receive the additional weighting under this subsection for sharing the services of an individual with a political subdivision or another school district even if the type of operational function performed by the individual for the school district and the type of operational function performed by the individual for the political subdivision or another school district are not the same operational function, so long as either both operational functions are eligible for weighting under this subsection or the operational function the individual performs for the school district is special education director. In either case, the school district shall be assigned the additional weighting for the type of operational function that the individual performs for the school district, and the school district shall not receive additional weighting for any other function performed by the individual. The operational function sharing arrangement does not need to be a newly implemented sharing arrangement to receive supplementary weighting under this subsection.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this paragraph “a”:\n\n(a) “College and career transition counselor or coordinator” means a licensed school counselor or an appropriately trained individual responsible for providing direct services to students, parents, families, schools, and postsecondary institutions to support college preparation and postsecondary success, such as college preparation, financial aid processing, and transition to postsecondary institution enrollment.\n\n(b) “Political subdivision” means a city, township, county, school corporation, merged area, area education agency, institution governed by the state board of regents, or any other governmental subdivision.\n\n(c) “School resource officer” means the same as defined in 34 U.S.C. §10389.\n\n(d) “Work-based learning coordinator” means an appropriately trained individual responsible for facilitating authentic, engaging work-based learning experiences for learners and educators in partnership with employers and others to enhance learning by connecting the content and skills that are necessary for future careers.\n\nb. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), each operational function assigned a supplementary weighting of five pupils under paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), shall instead be assigned a supplementary weighting of four pupils for the school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, but before July 1, 2035.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), each operational function assigned a supplementary weighting of three pupils under paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), shall instead be assigned a supplementary weighting of two pupils for the school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, but before July 1, 2035.\n\nc. School districts that share operational functions with other school districts are not required to be contiguous school districts. If two or more districts sharing operational functions are not contiguous to each other, the districts separating those districts are not required to be a party to the operational functions sharing arrangement.\n\nd. Supplementary weighting pursuant to this subsection shall be available to a school district during the period commencing with the budget year beginning July 1, 2014, through the budget year beginning July 1, 2034. The maximum amount of additional weighting for which a school district shall be eligible in a budget year is twenty-one additional pupils. Criteria for determining the qualification of operational functions for supplementary weighting shall be determined by the department by rule, through consideration of increased student opportunities.\n\ne. Supplementary weighting pursuant to this subsection shall be available to an area education agency during the period commencing with the budget year beginning July 1, 2014, through the budget year beginning July 1, 2034. The minimum amount of additional funding for which an area education agency shall be eligible in a budget year is thirty thousand dollars, and the maximum amount of additional funding for which an area education agency shall be eligible is two hundred thousand dollars. The department of management shall annually set a weighting for each area education agency to generate the approved operational sharing expense using the area education agency’s special education cost per pupil amount and foundation level. Criteria for determining the qualification of operational functions for supplementary weighting shall be determined by the department by rule, through consideration of increased student opportunities.\n\nf. This subsection is repealed effective July 1, 2035.\n\n6. Shared classes delivered over the Iowa communications network.\n\na. A school district that provides a virtual class to a pupil in another school district and the school district receiving that virtual class for a pupil shall each receive a supplemental weighting of one-twentieth of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends the virtual class.\n\nb. Fifty percent of the funding the school district providing the virtual class receives as a result of this subsection shall be reserved as additional pay for the virtual classroom instructor. If an instructor’s contract provides additional pay for teaching a virtual class, the instructor shall receive the greater amount of either the amount provided for in this paragraph or the amount provided for in the instructor’s contract.\n\nc. A school district receiving a virtual class for a pupil from a community college, which class meets the sharing agreement requirements in subsection 3, shall receive a supplemental funding weighting of one-twentieth of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends the virtual class.\n\nd. For the purposes of this subsection, “virtual class” means either of the following:\n\n(1) A class provided by a school district to a pupil in another school district via the Iowa communications network’s video services.\n\n(2) A class provided by a community college to a pupil in a school district via the Iowa communications network’s video services.\n\n7. District to community college innovative sharing project. A school district that collaborates with a community college to provide pupils enrolled in the school district’s high school with a class that uses an activities-based, project-based, and problem-based learning approach that is offered through a partnership with a nationally recognized provider of rigorous and innovative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curriculum for schools, which provider is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is eligible to assign its resident pupils attending the class an additional weighting of the percentage of the pupil’s school day during which the pupil attends a class described in this subsection times seventy hundredths. To qualify for additional weighting, the class must supplement, not supplant, high school courses required to be offered pursuant to section 256.11, subsection 5.\n\n8. Pupils ineligible. A pupil eligible for the weighting plan provided in section 256B.9 is not eligible for supplementary weighting pursuant to this section unless it is determined that the course generating the supplemental weighting has no relationship to the pupil’s disability. A pupil attending an alternative program or an at-risk pupils’ program, including alternative high school programs, is not eligible for supplementary weighting under subsection 2.\n\n9. Shared classes and curriculum standards. A school district shall ensure that any course made available to a student through any sharing agreement between the school district and a community college or any other entity providing course programming pursuant to this section to students enrolled in the school district meets the expectations contained in the core curriculum adopted pursuant to section 256.7, subsection 26. The school district shall ensure that any course that has the capacity to generate college credit shall be equivalent to college-level work.\n\n10. School finance appropriations report. The department of education shall annually prepare a report regarding school finance provisions or programs receiving a standing appropriation, including supplementary weighting programs. The report shall provide information regarding amounts received or accessed by school districts pursuant to the provisions or programs, whether the amounts received represent an increase or decrease over amounts received during the previous budget year and the percentage increase or decrease, conclusions regarding the adequacy of amounts received by school districts and whether the amounts received are equitable between school districts based upon input from the school districts and analysis by the department, and the rationale for current trends being observed by the department and projections regarding possible trends in the future. The report shall be submitted to the general assembly by January 1 each year, and copies of the report shall be forwarded to the chairpersons and members of the committee on education in the senate and in the house of representatives.\n\n89 Acts, ch 135, §11; 90 Acts, ch 1190, §7; 93 Acts, ch 180, §96; 95 Acts, ch 111, §1; 95 Acts, ch 209, §13; 2000 Acts, ch 1198, §1, 6; 2001 Acts, ch 126, §5, 6; 2002 Acts, ch 1047, §3, 4, 20; 2002 Acts, ch 1140, §8; 2003 Acts, ch 179, §111; 2003 Acts, ch 180, §11; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §38; 2007 Acts, ch 130, §2 – 4; 2007 Acts, ch 214, §20, 44; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §43; 2008 Acts, ch 1181, §48, 49; 2008 Acts, ch 1191, §157; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §247; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §100; 2010 Acts, ch 1016, §7; 2012 Acts, ch 1119, §37; 2013 Acts, ch 65, §1; 2013 Acts, ch 88, §5, 6; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §20; 2014 Acts, ch 1017, §2, 3; 2014 Acts, ch 1035, §1 – 3; 2015 Acts, ch 140, §37, 38, 58, 59; 2017 Acts, ch 153, §4, 7, 8; 2018 Acts, ch 1119, §12; 2018 Acts, ch 1166, §1 – 5; 2019 Acts, ch 100, §6; 2019 Acts, ch 101, §2; 2019 Acts, ch 164, §1, 2, 6; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §94; 2021 Acts, ch 139, §24 – 26; 2021 Acts, ch 170, §15; 2022 Acts, ch 1102, §1 – 4; 2022 Acts, ch 1153, §42; 2023 Acts, ch 1, §15, 18; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1011, 2555, 2605\n\nReferred to in §11.6, 256.17, 257.6, 257.11A, 257.38, 257.40, 257.41, 261E.2, 261E.3, 261E.6, 261E.8, 261E.9, 261E.10, 261E.11, 279.50A, 280.13A, 282.7, 282.27, 423F.3, 709.15\n\n2019 amendment to subsection 3, paragraph b, unnumbered paragraph 1, applies to certifications by the school budget review committee occurring before, on, or after July 1, 2019, for school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2019;\n\n2019 Acts, ch 164, §6\n\n2021 amendment to subsection 5, paragraph a, relating to work-based learning coordinators and special education directors, and subsection 5, paragraph b, applies to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, subject to the school budget year limitations of subsection 5; 2021 Acts, ch 139, §26\n\n2022 amendments to subsection 5, paragraph a, by 2022 Acts, ch 11022022 Acts, ch 1102, apply to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, subject to the school budget year limitations of subsection 5; 2022 Acts, ch 1102, §4\n\nSubsection 3, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 4, paragraph e, subparagraphs (2) and (3) amended\n\nSubsection 5 amended",

A transportation equity program is established to provide prioritized additional funding for school districts with a transportation cost per pupil that exceeds the statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil for the same budget year.\n\n2. a. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the department of management shall annually determine a statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil that is not lower than the statewide average transportation cost per pupil. The statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil shall be annually determined, by taking into account amounts appropriated to the transportation equity fund under subsection 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for those school districts with the highest transportation cost per pupil differential.\n\nb. Each school district that satisfies the criteria of subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in an amount equal to the school district’s actual enrollment for the school year, excluding the shared-time enrollment for the school year, multiplied by the school district’s transportation cost per pupil differential for the budget year.\n\nc. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) “Statewide average transportation cost per pupil” means the total transportation cost for all school districts in the state used to calculate each school district’s transportation cost per pupil under paragraph “d” divided by the total enrollment for all school districts used to calculate each school district’s transportation cost per pupil under paragraph “d”.\n\n(2) “Transportation cost per pupil differential” means an amount equal to a school district’s transportation cost per pupil minus the statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil for the same budget year.\n\nd.

A transportation equity fund is created as a separate and distinct fund in the state treasury under the control of the department of management. Moneys in the fund include revenues credited to the fund, appropriations made to the fund, and other moneys deposited in the fund. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, there is appropriated all moneys in the fund to the department of management for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments under this section.\n\nb.

For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if funding is available as provided in subsection 3, paragraph “b”, each school district in the state shall receive a transportation base funding payment in an amount equal to the school district’s enrollment used under subsection 2, paragraph “d”, multiplied by the lesser of the statewide average transportation cost per pupil or the school district’s transportation cost per pupil for the budget year. If an amount appropriated for a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base funding payments, the department of management shall prorate such payment amounts.\n\n5. a. The sum of the transportation equity aid payment and the transportation base funding payment paid to a school district for a budget year shall not exceed the school district’s actual transportation cost used to calculate the school district’s transportation cost per pupil under subsection 2, paragraph “d”, for the budget year.\n\nb. Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base funding payments shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as foundation aid is paid under section 257.16, and may be included in the monthly payment of state aid under section 257.16, subsection 2.\n\n6.

An educational improvement program is established to provide additional funding for school districts in which the regular program district cost per pupil for a budget year is one hundred ten percent of the regular program state cost per pupil for the budget year and which have approved the use of the instructional support program established in section 257.18. A board of directors that wishes to consider participating in the educational improvement program shall hold a hearing on the question of participation and the maximum percent of the regular program district cost of the district that will be used. The hearing shall be held in the manner provided in section 257.18 for the instructional support program. Following the hearing, the board may direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the question to the registered voters of the school district at an election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection 4, paragraph “c”. If a majority of those voting on the question favors participation in the program, the board shall adopt a resolution to participate and shall certify the results of the election to the department of management and the district shall participate in the program. If a majority of those voting on the question does not favor participation, the district shall not participate in the program.\n\n2. The educational improvement program shall provide additional revenues each fiscal year equal to a specified percent of the regular program district cost of the district, as determined by the board but not more than the maximum percent authorized by the electors if an election has been held. Certification of a district’s participation for a budget year, the method of funding, and the amount to be raised shall be made to the department of management not later than April 15 of the base year.\n\n3. The educational improvement program shall be funded by either an educational improvement property tax or by a combination of an educational improvement property tax and an educational improvement income surtax. The method of raising the educational improvement moneys shall be determined by the board. Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board uses a combination of an educational improvement property tax and an educational improvement income surtax, the board shall determine the percent of income surtax to be imposed, expressed as full percentage points, not to exceed twenty percent.\n\n4. The department of management shall establish the amount of the educational improvement property tax to be levied or the amount of the combination of the educational improvement property tax to be levied and the amount of the school district income surtax to be imposed for each school year that the educational improvement amount is authorized. The educational improvement property tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be levied and imposed, collected, and paid to the school district in the manner provided for the instructional support program in sections 257.21 through 257.26.

Not later than January 1, 1992, the committee shall adopt recommendations relating to the implementation by school districts and area education agencies of procedures pertaining to the preparation of financial reports in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and submit those recommendations to the state board of education. The state board shall consider the recommendations and adopt rules under section 256.7 specifying procedures and requiring the school districts and area education agencies to conform to generally accepted accounting principles commencing with the school year beginning July 1, 1996.\n\n5. If a district has unusual circumstances, creating an unusual need for additional funds, including but not limited to the circumstances enumerated in paragraphs “a” through “n”, the committee may grant supplemental aid to the district from any funds appropriated to the department of education for the use of the school budget review committee for the purposes of this subsection. The school budget review committee shall review a school district’s unexpended fund balance prior to any decision regarding unusual finance circumstances. Such aid shall be miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district cost. In addition to or as an alternative to granting supplemental aid the committee may establish a modified supplemental amount for the district. The school budget review committee shall review a school district’s unspent balance prior to any decision to establish a modified supplemental amount under this subsection.\n\na. Any unusual increase or decrease in enrollment.\n\nb. Unusual natural disasters.\n\nc. Unusual initial staffing problems.\n\nd. The closing of a nonpublic school, wholly or in part, or the opening or closing of a charter school.\n\ne. Substantial reduction in miscellaneous income due to circumstances beyond the control of the district.\n\nf.

Unusual need for a new course or program which will provide substantial benefit to pupils, if the district establishes the need and the amount of necessary increased cost.\n\nh. Unusual need for additional funds for special education or compensatory education programs.\n\ni. Year-round or substantially year-round attendance programs which apply toward graduation requirements, including but not limited to trimester or four-quarter programs.

Unusual need for additional funds for the costs associated with providing competent private instruction pursuant to chapter 299A.\n\n6. a. The committee shall establish a modified supplemental amount for a district when the district submits evidence that it requires additional funding for removal, management, or abatement of environmental hazards due to a state or federal requirement. Environmental hazards shall include but are not limited to the presence of asbestos, radon, or the presence of any other hazardous material dangerous to health and safety.\n\nb. The district shall include a budget for the actual cost of the project that may include the costs of inspection, reinspection, sampling, analysis, assessment, response actions, operations and maintenance, training, periodic surveillance, developing of management plans, recordkeeping requirements, and encapsulation or removal of the hazardous material.\n\n7. a. The committee may authorize a district to spend a reasonable and specified amount from its unexpended fund balance for the following purposes:\n\n(1) Furnishing, equipping, and contributing to the construction of a new building or structure for which the voters of the district have approved a bond issue as provided by law or the tax levy provided in section 298.2.\n\n(2) The costs associated with the demolition of an unused school building, or the conversion of an unused school building for community use, in a school district involved in a dissolution or reorganization under chapter 275, if the costs are incurred within three years of the dissolution or reorganization.\n\n(3) The costs associated with the demolition or repair of a building or structure in a school district if such costs are necessitated by, and incurred within two years of, a disaster as defined in section 29C.2, subsection 4.\n\nb. Other expenditures, including but not limited to expenditures for salaries or recurring costs, are not authorized under this subsection. Expenditures authorized under this subsection shall not be included in a modified supplemental amount or district cost, and the portion of the unexpended fund balance which is authorized to be spent shall be regarded as if it were miscellaneous income. Any part of the amount not actually spent for the authorized purpose shall revert to its former status as part of the unexpended fund balance.\n\n8. The committee may approve or modify the initial base year district cost of any district which changes accounting procedures.\n\n9. When the committee makes a decision under subsections 3 through 8, it shall make all necessary changes in the district cost, budget, and tax levy. It shall give written notice of its decision, including all such changes, to the school board through the department of education.\n\n10. All decisions by the committee under this chapter shall be made in accordance with reasonable and uniform policies which shall be consistent with this chapter. All such policies of general application shall be stated in rules adopted in accordance with chapter 17A. The committee shall take into account the intent of this chapter to equalize educational opportunity, to provide a good education for all the children of Iowa, to provide property tax relief, to decrease the percentage of school costs paid from property taxes, and to provide reasonable control of school costs. The committee shall also take into account the amount of funds available.\n\n11. Failure by any school district to provide information or appear before the committee as requested for the accomplishment of review or hearing is justification for the committee to instruct the director of the department of management to withhold any state aid to that district until the committee’s inquiries are satisfied completely.\n\n12. The committee shall review the recommendations of the director of the department of education relating to the special education weighting plan, and shall establish a weighting plan for each school year pursuant to section 256B.9, and report the plan to the director of the department of education.\n\n13. The committee may recommend that two or more school districts jointly employ and share the services of any school personnel, or acquire and share the use of classrooms, laboratories, equipment, and facilities as specified in section 280.15.\n\n14. As soon as possible following June 30 of the base year, the school budget review committee shall determine for each school district the balance of funds, whether positive or negative, raised for special education instruction programs under the special education weighting plan established in section 256B.9. The committee shall certify the balance of funds for each school district to the director of the department of management.\n\na. If the amount certified for a school district to the director of the department of management under this subsection for the base year is positive, the director of the department of management shall subtract the amount of the positive balance exceeding ten percent of the additional funds generated for special education, not to include any previous carryover, from the amount of state aid remaining to be paid to the district during the budget year. If the positive amount exceeding the ten percent amount exceeds the amount of state aid that remains to be paid to the district, not including any previous carryover, the school district shall pay the excess on a quarterly basis prior to June 30 of the budget year to the director of the department of management from other funds received by the district. The director of the department of management shall determine the amount of the positive balance that exceeds the ten percent amount that came from local property tax revenues and shall increase the district’s total state school aids available under this chapter for the next following budget year by the amount so determined and shall reduce the district’s tax levy computed under section 257.4 for the next following budget year by the amount necessary to compensate for the increased state aid.\n\nb. (1) If the amount certified for a school district to the director of the department of management under this subsection for the base year is negative, the director of the department of management shall determine the amount of the deficit that would have been state aid and the amount that would have been property taxes for each eligible school district.\n\n(2) There is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the school budget review committee for each fiscal year an amount equal to the state aid portion of five percent of the receipts for special education instruction programs in all districts that have a positive balance determined under paragraph “a” for the base year, or the state aid portion of all of the positive balances determined under paragraph “a” for the base year, whichever is less, to be used for supplemental aid payments to school districts. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph “b”, supplemental aid paid to a district is equal to the state aid portion of the district’s negative balance. The school budget review committee shall direct the director of the department of management to make the payments to school districts under this paragraph “b”.\n\n(3) A school district is only eligible to receive supplemental aid payments during the budget year if the school district certifies to the school budget review committee that for the year following the budget year it will notify the school budget review committee to instruct the director of the department of management to increase the district’s modified supplemental amount and will fund the modified supplemental amount increase either by using moneys from its unexpended fund balance to reduce the district’s property tax levy or by using cash reserve moneys to equal the amount of the deficit that would have been property taxes and any part of the state aid portion of the deficit not received as supplemental aid under this subsection. The director of the department of management shall make the necessary adjustments to the school district’s budget to provide the modified supplemental amount and shall make the supplemental aid payments.\n\n(4) If the amount appropriated under this lettered paragraph is insufficient to make the supplemental aid payments under this subsection, the director of the department of management shall prorate the payments on the basis of the amount appropriated.\n\n15. Annually the school budget review committee shall review the amount of property tax levied by each school district for the cash reserve authorized in section 298.10. If in the committee’s judgment, the amount of a district’s cash reserve levy is unreasonably high, the committee shall instruct the director of the department of management to reduce that district’s tax levy computed under section 257.4 for the following budget year by the amount the cash reserve levy is deemed excessive. A reduction in a district’s property tax levy for a budget year under this subsection does not affect the district’s authorized budget.\n\n16. The committee shall perform the duties assigned to it under sections 257.32, 257.40, and 260C.18B.\n\n17. a. If a district’s average transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average transportation costs per pupil determined under paragraph “c” by one hundred fifty percent, the committee may grant transportation assistance aid to the district. Such aid shall be miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district cost.\n\nb. To be eligible for transportation assistance aid, a school district shall annually certify its actual cost for all children transported in all school buses not later than July 31 after each school year on forms prescribed by the committee.\n\nc. A district’s average transportation costs per pupil shall be determined by dividing the district’s actual cost for all children transported in all school buses for a school year pursuant to section 285.1, subsection 12, less the amount received for transporting nonpublic school pupils under section 285.1, by the district’s actual enrollment for the school year excluding the shared-time enrollment for the school year as defined in section 257.6. The state average transportation costs per pupil shall be determined by dividing the total actual costs for all children transported in all districts for a school year, by the total of all districts’ actual enrollments for the school year.\n\nd. Funds transferred to the committee in accordance with section 321.34, subsection 22, are appropriated to and may be expended for the purposes of the committee, as described in this section. However, highest priority shall be given to districts that meet the conditions described in this subsection. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, unencumbered or unobligated funds transferred to the committee pursuant to section 321.34, subsection 22, remaining on June 30 of the fiscal year for which the funds were transferred, shall not revert but shall be available for expenditure for the purposes of this subsection in subsequent fiscal years.\n\n18. If a school district exceeds its authorized budget or carries a negative unspent balance for two or more consecutive years, the committee may recommend that the department implement a phase II on-site visit to conduct a fiscal review pursuant to section 256.11, subsection 10, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (e).\n\n89 Acts, ch 135, §31; 91 Acts, ch 267, §520; 93 Acts, ch 101, §202; 94 Acts, ch 1175, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1088, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1215, §22; 97 Acts, ch 23, §26; 2003 Acts, ch 79, §4, 7, 8; 2006 Acts, ch 1152, §25; 2006 Acts, ch 1182, §41, 54; 2007 Acts, ch 42, §2; 2007 Acts, ch 108, §8; 2008 Acts, ch 1191, §109; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2009 Acts, ch 54, §6; 2009 Acts, ch 65, §4; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §190, 250; 2010 Acts, ch 1004, §3 – 6, 10; 2013 Acts, ch 90, §257; 2013 Acts, ch 121, §27 – 30, 42; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §89; 2014 Acts, ch 1013, §6 – 9; 2014 Acts, ch 1026, §63; 2014 Acts, ch 1135, §12; 2018 Acts, ch 1112, §3, 18; 2021 Acts, ch 112, §16\n\nReferred to in §256.11, 256C.4, 257.6, 257.8, 257.13, 257.16C, 257.30, 257.32, 284.13, 321.34",

The budget of an adopted program for at-risk students, secondary students who attend alternative programs or alternative schools, or returning dropouts and dropout prevention for a school district, after subtracting funds received under section 257.11, subsection 4, paragraphs “a” through “c”, and from other sources for that purpose, including any previous carryover or amount designated from the school district’s flexibility account under section 298A.2, subsection 2, shall be funded annually on a basis of one-fourth or more from the district cost of the school district and up to three-fourths through establishment of a modified supplemental amount. Annually, the department of management shall establish a modified supplemental amount for each such school district equal to the difference between the approved budget for the program for that district and the sum of the amount funded from the district cost of the school district plus funds received under section 257.11, subsection 4, and from other sources for that purpose, including any previous carryover or amount designated from the school district’s flexibility account under section 298A.2, subsection 2.\n\n2. Appropriate uses of funding. Appropriate uses of the funding for an adopted program include but are not limited to the following:\n\na. Salary and benefits for staff including but not limited to instructional staff, instructional support staff, administrative staff, and guidance counselors, salary and benefits or contract payments for psychologists licensed under chapter 154B, licensed independent social workers or master social workers under chapter 154C, licensed mental health counselors under chapter 154D, and salary and benefits for school-based youth services staff who are working with at-risk or dropout prevention programs, alternative programs, and alternative schools, in a traditional or alternative setting, or who are working with students who are participating in such programs or schools, if such person’s time is dedicated to working with the program or with such students in order to provide services beyond those which are provided by the school district to students who are not participating in such programs or alternative schools. However, if such person works part-time with students who are participating in a program or alternative school and the person has another unrelated assignment, only the portion of the person’s time that is related to the program or alternative school may be charged to the program or school. For each such person who works part time or on a contract basis with the program or with students who are participating in a program or alternative school, the school district shall have the authority to designate the portion of the person’s time and the corresponding amount of salary and benefits or contract payment amount that is related to the program or alternative school and shall include such designation as part of the program plan under section 257.38, if applicable. For purposes of this paragraph, if an alternative setting is necessary to provide for a program which is offered at a location off school grounds and which is intended to serve student needs by improving relationships and connections to school, decreasing truancy and tardiness, providing opportunities for course credit recovery, or helping students identified as at risk to accelerate through multiple grade levels of achievement within a shortened time frame, the tuition costs for a student identified as at risk shall be considered an appropriate use of the program funding under this section.\n\nb. Professional development for all teachers, counselors, and staff identified in paragraph “a” who are working with at-risk students under a program or an alternative school setting.\n\nc. Research-based resources, materials, software, supplies, and purchased services that meet all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Meets the needs of kindergarten through grade twelve students identified as at risk.\n\n(2) Are beyond those provided by the regular school program.\n\n(3) Are necessary to provide the services listed in the school district’s plan submitted pursuant to section 257.38.\n\n(4) Will remain with the kindergarten through grade twelve at-risk program, alternative program or alternative school, or returning dropout and dropout prevention program.\n\nd. Costs incurred for a program intended to address high rates of absenteeism, truancy, or frequent tardiness.\n\ne. Costs incurred for programs authorized under section 257.11, subsection 4, paragraph “d”.\n\nf. Any purpose determined by the board of directors that directly benefits students participating in the adopted program.\n\ng. School security personnel costs.\n\n3. Limitation. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013, and each succeeding fiscal year, the ratio of the amount of the modified supplemental amount established by the department of management compared to the school district’s total regular program district cost shall not exceed two and one-half percent. However, if the school district’s highest such ratio so determined for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2009, but before July 1, 2013, exceeded two and one-half percent, the ratio may exceed two and one-half percent but shall not exceed the highest such ratio established during that period.\n\n4. Other uses. Notwithstanding subsection 2 and section 282.24, if a student has been determined by the school district to be likely to inflict self-harm or likely to harm another student and all of the following apply, the school district may use the modified supplemental amount established under subsection 1 to pay the instructional costs necessary to address the student’s behavior during instructional time when those services are not otherwise provided to students who do not require special education and the costs exceed the costs of instruction of students in a regular curriculum:\n\na. The student does not require special education.\n\nb. The student is not in a court-ordered placement under chapter 232 under the care and custody of the department of health and human services or juvenile court services.\n\nc. The student is not in the state training school pursuant to a court order entered under chapter 232 under the care and custody of the department of health and human services.\n\nd.
