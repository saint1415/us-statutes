This activity may be accomplished through a wide variety of partnerships, public and private joint ventures, and cooperative endeavors, primarily, but not exclusively, in the area of high technology, and may result in investments by the private sector for commercialization of the technology and job creation. It is imperative that whenever possible, the investments and job creation be in Iowa but need not be in the proximity of the universities. The purpose of the investments and job creation shall be to expand and stimulate Iowa’s economy, increase the wealth of Iowans, and increase the population of Iowa, which may be accomplished through research conducted within the state that will competitively position Iowa on an economic basis with other states and create high-wage, high-growth employers and jobs. Accredited private universities located in the state are encouraged to incorporate the intent of this section into the mission of their universities.\n\n88 Acts, ch 1268, §10;\n\n2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1, §96, 133\n\n[2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1, §96, 133 amendment to this section rescinded pursuant to Rants v.
