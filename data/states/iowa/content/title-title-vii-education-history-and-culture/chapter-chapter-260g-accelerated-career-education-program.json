The employer shall receive a credit against all withholding taxes due by the employer regardless of whether or not the withholding from the employer of current program job wages is less than ten percent. The employer shall remit the amount of the credit quarterly in the same manner as withholding payments are reported to the department of revenue, to the community college to be allocated to and when collected paid into a special fund of the community college to pay, in part, the program costs.

Once program job credits have been allocated to a community college, the full allocation shall be received by the community college throughout the fiscal year and for the term of the agreement even if the statewide program job credit maximum amount is subsequently allocated and used.\n\n2.
