If an existing private educational institution or an existing vocational institution offering a career and technical education program within the merged area has facilities and curriculum of adequate size and quality which would duplicate the functions of the area school, the board of directors shall discuss with the institution the possibility of entering into contracts to have the existing institution offer facilities and curriculum to students of the merged area. The board of directors shall consider any proposals submitted by the private institution for providing such facilities and curriculum. The board of directors may enter into such contracts.

Each community college shall establish procedures for the determination of controversies in connection with the imposition of penalties. The procedures shall require giving notice of the violation and the penalty prescribed and providing the opportunity for an administrative hearing.\n\n11. Be authorized to issue to employees of community colleges school credit cards to use for payment of authorized expenditures incurred in the performance of work-related duties.\n\n12.

      "text": "260C.18C State aid distribution formula.\n\n1. Purpose. A distribution plan for general state financial aid to Iowa’s community colleges is established for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2005, and succeeding fiscal years. Funds appropriated by the general assembly to the department for general financial aid to community colleges shall be allocated to each community college in the manner provided under this section.\n\n2. Definitions.

The department shall review and provide a determination should a question of eligibility occur.\n\nj. “Eligible growth support” for a community college is the community college’s below-average support per FTEE multiplied times its three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollment.\n\nk. “Eligible noncredit courses” means all noncredit courses eligible for general state financial aid which fall under one of the eligible categories for noncredit courses as defined by rule of the department. The department shall review and provide a determination should a question of eligibility occur.\n\nl. “Eligible student” means a student enrolled in eligible credit or eligible noncredit courses. The department shall review and provide a determination should a question of eligibility occur.\n\nm. “Fiscal year” means the period of twelve months beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30.\n\nn.

The inflation adjustment amount shall not be less than zero.\n\nr. “Inflation rate” means the average of the preceding twelve-month percentage change, which shall be computed on a monthly basis, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, not seasonally adjusted, published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, calculated for the calendar year ending six months after the beginning of the base year.\n\ns. “State-average combined support per FTEE” means the average of the combined support per FTEE for all community colleges in the state in the base year.\n\nt. “Three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollment” means the average of the audited full-time equivalent enrollment for a community college over the three fiscal years prior to the base year as determined by the department.\n\nu. “Total growth support amount” means the sum of the eligible growth support for all the community colleges.\n\n3. Distribution formula. Moneys appropriated by the general assembly from the general fund to the department for community college purposes for general state financial aid for a budget year shall be allocated to each community college by the department as follows:\n\na. If the inflation rate is equal to two percent or less:\n\n(1) Base funding allocation. The moneys shall first be allocated in the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year. If the appropriation is less than the total of the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year, the moneys shall be allocated in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(2) Marginal cost adjustment. After the base funding has been allocated, each community college shall be allocated up to an additional two percent of its base funding allocation. The community college’s allocation shall be in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(3) Three-year rolling average of full-time equivalent enrollment. If the increase in the total state general aid exceeds two percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be distributed based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(4) Extraordinary growth adjustment. If the increase in total state general aid exceeds three percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be distributed as follows:\n\n(a) Forty percent of the moneys shall be allocated based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(b) Sixty percent of the moneys shall be allocated to community colleges that have eligible growth support. The allocation shall be based upon the proportional share that each community college’s eligible growth support bears to the total growth support amount. Once the moneys allocated under this subparagraph division equal the total growth support amount, the remaining moneys allocated under this subparagraph shall be allocated as provided in subparagraph division (a).\n\n(5) Additional three-year rolling average FTEE allocation. If the increase in total state general aid exceeds four percent over the base funding allocation, all remaining moneys shall be distributed based upon each college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\nb. If the inflation rate is greater than two percent but less than four percent:\n\n(1) Base funding allocation. The moneys shall first be allocated in the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year. If the appropriation is less than the total of the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year, the moneys shall be allocated in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(2) Marginal cost adjustment. After the base funding has been allocated, each community college shall be allocated up to an additional two percent of its base funding allocation. The community college’s allocation shall be in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(3) Three-year rolling average of full-time equivalent enrollment. If the increase in the total state general aid exceeds two percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be distributed based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(4) Extraordinary growth adjustment. If the increase in total state general aid exceeds three percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be based as follows:\n\n(a) Forty percent of the moneys shall be allocated based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(b) Sixty percent of the moneys shall be allocated to community colleges that have eligible growth support. The allocation shall be based upon the proportional share that each community college’s eligible growth support bears to the total growth support amount. Once the moneys allocated under this subparagraph division equal the total growth support amount, the remaining moneys allocated under this subparagraph shall be allocated as provided in subparagraph division (a).\n\n(5) Inflation adjustment. If the increase in total state general aid exceeds four percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to the inflation adjustment amount shall be distributed to each community college in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(6) Additional three-year rolling average FTEE allocation. If there are remaining moneys to be distributed under this paragraph after distributing moneys under subparagraph (5), all remaining moneys shall be distributed based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\nc. If the inflation rate equals or exceeds four percent:\n\n(1) Base funding allocation. The moneys shall first be allocated in the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year. If the appropriation is less than the total of the amount of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year, the moneys shall be allocated in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(2) Marginal cost adjustment. After the base funding has been allocated, each community college shall be allocated up to an additional two percent of its base funding allocation. The community college’s allocation shall be in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(3) Three-year rolling average of full-time equivalent enrollment. If the increase in the total state general aid exceeds two percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be distributed based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(4) Inflation adjustment. If the increase in total state general aid exceeds three percent over the base funding allocation, an amount up to the inflation adjustment amount shall be distributed to each community college in the same proportion as the allocation of general state financial aid each community college received in the base year.\n\n(5) Extraordinary growth adjustment. If there are remaining moneys to be distributed under this paragraph after distributing moneys under subparagraph (4), an amount up to an additional one percent of the base funding allocation shall be based as follows:\n\n(a) Forty percent of the moneys shall be allocated based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n(b) Sixty percent of the moneys shall be allocated to community colleges that have eligible growth support. The allocation shall be based upon the proportional share that each community college’s eligible growth support bears to the total growth support amount. Once the moneys allocated under this subparagraph division equal the total growth support amount, the remaining moneys allocated under this subparagraph shall be allocated as provided in subparagraph division (a).\n\n(6) Additional three-year rolling average FTEE allocation. If there are remaining moneys to be distributed under this paragraph after distributing moneys under subparagraph (5), all remaining moneys shall be distributed based upon each community college’s proportional share of the three-year rolling average full-time equivalent enrollments for all community colleges.\n\n4. Information supplied by colleges and adoption of rules.\n\na. Each community college shall provide information in the manner and form as determined by the department. If a community college fails to provide the information as requested, the department shall estimate the full-time equivalent enrollment of that college.\n\nb. Each community college shall complete and submit an annual student enrollment audit to the department. Adjustments to community college state general aid allocations shall be made based on student enrollment audit outcomes.\n\nc. The department shall adopt rules under chapter 17A as necessary for the allocation of general state financial aid.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 169, §24; 2008 Acts, ch 1181, §25; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263\n\nReferred to in §84A.16, 260H.2, 260I.2",

In addition to the tax authorized under section 260C.17 and upon resolution of the board of directors, the voters in a merged area may at the regular school election or at a special election held on the second Tuesday in September of the even-numbered year vote a tax not exceeding twenty and one-fourth cents per thousand dollars of assessed value in any one year for a period not to exceed ten years, unless otherwise provided under subsection 2, for the purchase of grounds, construction of buildings, payment of debts contracted for the construction of buildings, purchase of buildings and equipment for buildings, and the acquisition of libraries, for the purpose of paying costs of utilities, and for the purpose of maintaining, remodeling, improving, or expanding the community college of the merged area. If the tax levy is approved under this section, the costs of utilities shall be paid from the proceeds of the levy. The tax shall be collected by the county treasurers and remitted to the treasurer of the merged area as provided in section 331.552, subsection 29. The proceeds of the tax shall be deposited in a separate and distinct fund to be known as the voted tax fund, to be paid out upon warrants drawn by the president and secretary of the board of directors of the merged area district for the payment of costs incurred in providing the school facilities for which the tax was authorized.\n\nb. In order to make immediately available to the merged area the proceeds of the voted tax authorized to be levied under this section, the board of directors of any such merged area is hereby authorized, without the necessity for any further election, to borrow money and enter into loan agreements in anticipation of the collection of such tax, and such board shall, by resolution, provide for the levy of an annual tax, within the limits of the special voted tax authorized under this section, sufficient to pay the amount of any such loan and the interest thereon to maturity as the same becomes due. A certified copy of this resolution shall be filed with the county auditors of the counties in which such merged area is located, and the filing thereof shall make it a duty of such auditors to enter annually this levy for collection until funds are realized to repay the loan and interest thereon in full. Said loan shall bear interest at a rate or rates not exceeding that permitted by chapter 74A. Any loan agreement entered into pursuant to authority contained in this section shall be in such form as the board of directors shall by resolution provide and the loan shall be payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of the annual levy of the voted tax authorized under this section, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to pay the loan and interest thereon. In furtherance of the foregoing the board of directors of such merged area may, with or without notice, negotiate and enter into a loan agreement or agreements with any bank, investment banker, trust company, insurance company or group thereof, whereunder the borrowing of the necessary funds may be assured and consummated. The proceeds of such loan shall be deposited in a special fund, to be kept separate and apart from all other funds of the merged area, and shall be paid out upon warrants drawn by the president and secretary of the board of directors to pay the cost of acquiring the school facilities for which the tax was authorized.\n\nc. If the boundary lines of a merged area are changed, the levy of the annual tax provided in this section sufficient to pay the amount due for a loan agreement and the interest on the loan agreement to maturity shall continue in any territory severed from the merged area until the loan with interest on the loan has been paid in full.\n\nd. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the board of directors to levy the full amount of the voted tax, but if and to whatever extent said tax is levied in any year in excess of the amount of principal and interest falling due in such year under any loan agreement, the first available proceeds thereof, to an amount sufficient to meet maturing installments of principal and interest under the loan agreement, shall be paid into the sinking fund for such loan before any of such taxes are otherwise made available to the merged area for other school purposes, and the amount required to be annually set aside to pay the principal of and interest on the money borrowed under such loan agreement shall constitute a first charge upon all of the proceeds of such annual special voted tax, which tax shall be pledged to pay said loan and the interest thereon.\n\ne. This subsection shall be construed as supplemental and in addition to existing statutory authority and as providing an independent method of financing the cost of acquiring school facilities for which a tax has been voted under this section and for the borrowing of money and execution of loan agreements in connection therewith and shall not be construed as subject to the provisions of any other law. The fact that a merged area may have previously borrowed money and entered into loan agreements under the authority contained in this section shall not prevent such merged area from borrowing additional money and entering into further loan agreements provided that the aggregate of the amount payable under all of such loan agreements does not exceed the proceeds of the voted tax. All acts and proceedings heretofore taken by the board of directors or by any official of any merged area for the exercise of any of the powers granted by this section are hereby legalized and validated in all respects.\n\n2. Following approval of the tax at two consecutive elections under subsection 1 where the question of imposing the tax appeared on the ballot, if the tax has been imposed for a period of at least twenty consecutive years, the board of directors of the merged area may, by resolution adopted at any time before the end of the most recently authorized period of time for imposing the tax, continue to impose the voted tax each year for an additional period not to exceed ten years at a rate not to exceed the maximum rate approved at election until the tax is discontinued or the maximum rate is increased following an election pursuant to subsection 3. An increase in the maximum rate of the voted tax, not to exceed the maximum rate specified in subsection 1, shall be approved at election pursuant to the requirements of subsection 3.\n\n3. A voted tax imposed under this section may be discontinued, or its maximum rate increased, by petition and election. Upon receipt of a petition containing the required number of signatures, the board of directors of a merged area shall direct each county commissioner of elections responsible under section 47.2 for conducting elections in the merged area to submit to the voters of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the authority of the board of directors to impose the voted tax under this section or to increase the maximum rate of the voted tax, whichever is applicable. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to not less than twenty-five percent of the votes cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where the question of the imposition of the tax appeared on the ballot and received by the board of directors by June 1 of the year in which the election is to be held. The question shall be submitted at an election held on a date authorized for an election under subsection 1, paragraph “a”.

The process shall be jointly developed and agreed upon by the department of education and the community colleges. The state accreditation process shall be integrated with the accreditation process of the higher learning commission, including the evaluation cycle, the self-study process, and the criteria for evaluation, which shall incorporate the standards for community colleges developed under section 260C.48; and shall identify and make provision for the needs of the state that are not met by the commission’s accreditation process. The department of education shall use a two-component process for the continued accreditation of community college programs.\n\na. The first component consists of submission of required data by the community colleges and annual monitoring by the department of education of all community colleges for compliance with state program evaluation requirements adopted by the state board.\n\nb. The second component consists of the use of an accreditation team appointed by the director of the department of education, to conduct an evaluation, including an on-site visit of each community college, with a comprehensive evaluation occurring once every ten years, and an interim evaluation midway between comprehensive evaluations. The number and composition of the accreditation team shall be determined by the director, but the team shall include members of the department of education staff and community college staff members from community colleges other than the community college that conducts the programs being evaluated for accreditation. The accreditation team shall monitor the quality faculty plan implemented by each community college pursuant to section 260C.36.\n\nc. Rules adopted by the state board shall include provisions for coordination of the accreditation process under this section with activities of accreditation agencies, which are designed to avoid duplication in the accreditation process.\n\n2. Prior to a visit to a community college, members of the accreditation team shall have access to the program audit report filed with the department for that community college. After a visit to a community college, the accreditation team shall determine whether the accreditation standards for a program have been met and shall make a report to the director and the state board, together with a recommendation as to whether the program of the community college should remain accredited. The accreditation team shall report strengths and weaknesses, if any, for each program standard and shall advise the community college of available resources and technical assistance to further enhance strengths and improve areas of weakness. A community college may respond to the accreditation team’s report.\n\n3. The state board shall determine whether a program of a community college shall remain accredited. If the state board determines that a program of a community college does not meet accreditation standards, the director of the department of education, in cooperation with the board of directors of the community college, shall establish a plan prescribing the procedures that must be taken to correct deficiencies in meeting the program standards, and shall establish a deadline date for correction of the deficiencies. The deadline for correction of deficiencies under a plan shall be no later than June 30 of the year following the on-site visit of the accreditation team. The plan is subject to approval of the state board. Plans shall include components which address meeting program deficiencies, sharing or merger options, discontinuance of specific programs or courses of study, and any other options proposed by the state board or the accreditation team to allow the college to meet the program standards.\n\n4. During the time specified in the plan for its implementation, the community college program remains accredited. The accreditation team shall revisit the community college and shall determine whether the deficiencies in the standards for the program have been corrected and shall make a report and recommendation to the director and the state board. The state board shall review the report and recommendation, may request additional information, and shall determine whether the deficiencies in the program have been corrected.\n\n5. If the deficiencies have not been corrected in a program of a community college, the community college board shall take one of the following actions within sixty days from removal of accreditation:\n\na. Merge the deficient program or programs with a program or programs from another accredited community college.\n\nb. Contract with another educational institution for purposes of program delivery at the community college.\n\nc. Discontinue the program or programs which have been identified as deficient.\n\n6. The director of the department of education shall give a community college which has a program which fails to meet accreditation standards at least one year’s notice prior to removal of accreditation of the program. The notice shall be given by certified mail or restricted certified mail addressed to the superintendent of the community college and shall specify the reasons for removal of accreditation of the program. The notice shall also be sent by ordinary mail to each member of the board of directors of the community college. Any good faith error or failure to comply with the notice requirements shall not affect the validity of any action by the director. If, during the year, the community college remedies the reasons for removal of accreditation of the program and satisfies the director that the community college will comply with the accreditation standards for that program in the future, the director shall continue the accreditation of the program of the community college and shall transmit notice of the action to the community college by certified mail or restricted certified mail.\n\n7. The action of the director to remove a community college’s accreditation of the program may be appealed to the state board. At the hearing, the community college may be represented by counsel and may present evidence. The state board may provide for the hearing to be recorded or reported. If requested by the community college at least ten days before the hearing, the state board shall provide for the hearing to be recorded or reported at the expense of the community college, using any reasonable method specified by the community college. Within ten days after the hearing, the state board shall render a written decision, and shall affirm, modify, or vacate the action or proposed action to remove the college’s accreditation of the program.

Standards developed shall include a provision that the full-time teaching load for an instructor in arts and sciences courses shall be fifteen credit hours per semester, or the equivalent, and the maximum academic workload shall be sixteen credit hours per semester, or the equivalent. An instructor may also have an additional teaching assignment if the instructor and the community college administration mutually consent to the additional assignment and the total teaching load does not exceed twenty-two hours of credit per semester, or the equivalent.\n\n3. Standards developed shall include provisions requiring equal access in recruitment, enrollment, and placement activities for students with special education needs. The provisions shall include a requirement that students with special education needs shall receive instruction in the least restrictive environment with access to the full range of program offerings at a college, through, but not limited to, adaptation of curriculum, instruction, equipment, facilities, career guidance, and counseling services.\n\n4.
