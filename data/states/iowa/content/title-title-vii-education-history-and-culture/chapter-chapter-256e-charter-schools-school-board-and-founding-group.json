For purposes of this section, residence means a residence under section 282.1.\n\n2. a. The charter school in which the student is enrolled shall receive under paragraph “c” an amount equal to the sum of the state cost per pupil for the previous school year plus the teacher leadership supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year as provided in section 257.9 plus any moneys received by the school district of residence for the student as a result of the non-English speaking weighting under section 280.4, subsection 3, for the previous school year multiplied by the state cost per pupil for the previous year.
