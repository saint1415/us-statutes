Notwithstanding chapter 602 the jurisdiction ofthe district court established in this subsection may be exercised by district associate judges. 6.\n\n“Solar collector”\n\nmeans a device or structural feature of a building that collects solar energy and that is part of a system for the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy.For purposes of this chapter, a greenhouse is a solar collector. 7.\n\n“Solar energy”\n\nmeans energy emitted from the sun and collected in the form of heat or light by a solar collector.

The application shall statethe following:\n\na.\n\nA statement of the need for the solar access easement by the owner of the dominant estate.\n\nb.\n\nA legal description of the dominant and servient estates.\n\nc.\n\nThe name and address of the dominant and servient estate owners of record.\n\nd.\n\nA description of the solar collector to be used.\n\ne.\n\nThe size and location of the collector, including heights, its orientation with respect to south, and its slope from the horizontal shown either by drawings or in words.\n\nf.\n\nAn explanation of how the applicant has done everything reasonable, taking cost and efficiency into account, to design and locate the collector in a manner to minimize the impacton development of servient estates.\n\ng.\n\nA legal description of the solar access easement which is sought and a drawing that is a spatial representation of the area of the servient estate burdened by the easement illustratingthe degrees of the vertical and horizontal angles through which the easement extends overthe burdened property and the points from which those angles are measured.\n\nh.\n\nA statement that the applicant has attempted to voluntarily negotiate a solar access easement with the owner of the servient estate and has been unsuccessful in obtaining theeasement voluntarily.\n\ni.\n\nA statement that the space to be burdened by the solar access easement is not obstructed at the time of filing of the application by anything other than vegetation that would shade thesolar collector. 2.

The board may return an application for correction of any deficiencies. Upon acceptanceof an application the board shall schedule a hearing. The board shall cause a copy of theapplication and a notice of the hearing to be served upon the owners of the servient estates inthe manner provided for service of original notice and at least twenty days prior to the dateof the hearing.

The board shall grant a solaraccess easement if the board finds that there is a need for the solar collector, that the spaceburdened by the easement was not obstructed by anything except vegetation that would shadethe solar collector at the time of filing of the application, that the proposed location of thecollector minimizes the impact of the easement on the development of the servient estate andthat the applicant tried and failed to negotiate a voluntary easement. However, the board mayrefuse to grant a solar access easement upon a finding that the easement would require theremoval of trees that provide shade or a windbreak to a residence on the servient estate. Theboard shall not grant a solar access easement upon a servient estate if the board finds thatthe owner, at least six months prior to the filing of the application, has made a substantialfinancial commitment to build a structure that will shade the solar collector. In issuing itsorder granting the solar access easement, the board may modify the solar access easementapplied for and impose conditions on the location of the solar collector that will minimize theimpact upon the servient estate. 2. The solar access regulatory board shall grant a solar access easement only within the area that is within three hundred feet of the center of the northernmost boundary of thecollector and is south of a line drawn east and west tangent to the northernmost boundary ofthe collector. 3. The solar access regulatory board shall determine the amount of compensation that is to be paid to the owners of the servient estate for the impairment of the right to develop theproperty. Compensation shall be based on the difference between the fair market value of theproperty prior to and after granting the solar access easement. The parties shall be notified ofthe board’s decision within thirty days of the date of the hearing. The owner of the dominantestate shall have thirty days from the date of notification of the board’s decision to depositthe compensation with the board. Upon receipt of the compensation, the board shall issuean order granting the solar access easement to the owner of the dominant estate and remitthe compensation awarded to the owners of the servient estate. The owner of the dominantestate may decline to deposit the compensation with the board, and no order granting thesolar access easement shall then be issued. 4. When the order granting the solar access easement is issued, the owner of the dominant estate shall have it recorded in the office of the county recorder who shall record the solaraccess easement and list the owner of the dominant estate as grantee and the owner of theservient estate as grantor in the deed index. The solar access easement after being recordedshall be considered an easement appurtenant in or on the servient estate.
