A person appointed to the office of county attorney shall be a resident of the county at the time of appointment.\n\n(2) However, if within fourteen days after the appointment is made, a petition is circulated and filed with the county auditor requesting a special election to fill the vacancy, the appointment is temporary and a special election shall be called as provided in paragraph “b”. The petition shall meet the requirements of section 331.306. A signature shall not be considered valid if the signature is dated prior to the date on which the appointment was made.\n\nb.
