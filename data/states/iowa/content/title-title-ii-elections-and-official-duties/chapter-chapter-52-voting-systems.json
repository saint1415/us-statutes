Testing shall be completed not later than twelve hours before the opening of the polls on the morning of the election. The procedure for conducting the test shall be as follows:\n\n1. For any election to fill a partisan office, the county chairperson of each political party shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place the test will be conducted, so that they may be present or have a representative present. For every election, the commissioner shall publish notice of the date, time, and place the test will be conducted. The commissioner may include such notice in the notice of the election published pursuant to section 49.53. The test shall be open to the public.\n\n2. The test shall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballots marked so as to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate, and on each public question, on the ballot. The test group shall include for each office and each question one or more ballots having votes in excess of the number allowed by law for that office or question, in order to test the ability of the automatic tabulating equipment to reject such votes. Any observer may submit an additional test group of ballots which, if so submitted, shall also be tested. The state commissioner shall promulgate administrative rules establishing procedures for any additional test group of ballots submitted by an observer. If any error is detected, its cause shall be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count obtained before the automatic tabulating equipment is approved. When so approved, a statement attesting to the fact shall be signed by the commissioner and kept with the records of the election.\n\n3. The test group of ballots used for the test shall be clearly labeled as such, and retained in the commissioner’s office. The test group of ballots and the programs used for the counting procedure shall be sealed, retained for the time required for and disposed of in the same manner as ballots cast in the election.\n\n4.

If any ballot is found damaged or defective, so that it cannot be counted properly by the automatic tabulating equipment, a true duplicate shall be made by the resolution board team and substituted for the damaged or defective ballot, or, as an alternative, the valid votes on a defective ballot may be manually counted by the special precinct election board, whichever method is best suited to the system being used. All duplicate ballots shall be clearly labeled as such, and shall bear a serial number which shall also be recorded on the damaged or defective ballot.\n\nb. The special precinct election board shall also tabulate any write-in votes which were cast. Write-in votes cast for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot for the same office shall be counted as a vote for the candidate indicated, if the vote is otherwise properly cast.\n\nc. Ballots which are rejected by the tabulating equipment as blank because they have been marked with an unreadable marker shall be duplicated or tabulated as required by this subsection for damaged or defective ballots. The commissioner may instruct the special precinct election board to mark over voters’ unreadable marks using a marker compatible with the tabulating equipment. The special precinct election board shall take care to leave part of the original mark made by the voter. If it is impossible to mark over the original marks made by the voter without completely obliterating them, the ballot shall be duplicated.\n\n2. The record printed by the automatic tabulating equipment, with the addition of a record of any write-in or other votes manually counted pursuant to this chapter, shall constitute the official return of the absentee ballot and special voters precinct. Upon completion of the tabulation of the votes, the result shall be announced and reported in substantially the manner required by section 50.11.\n\n3.
