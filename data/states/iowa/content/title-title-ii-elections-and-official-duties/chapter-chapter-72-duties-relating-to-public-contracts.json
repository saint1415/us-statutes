The public body may request additional design proposals in light of funds available for construction, aesthetic considerations, or any other reason.\n\nc. This subsection applies for all design development proposals requested on or after January 1, 1991.\n\n2. The director of the economic development authority, in consultation with the department of management and the state building code commissioner, shall develop standards and methods to evaluate design development documents and construction documents based upon life cycle cost factors to facilitate fair and uniform comparisons between design proposals and informed decision making by public bodies.\n\n3. The department of management shall develop a proposal for submission to the general assembly on or before January 10, 1991, to create a division within the department of management to evaluate life cycle costs on design proposals submitted on public improvement and construction contracts for agencies of the state, to assure uniform comparisons and professional evaluations of design proposals by an independent agency. The report shall also address potential redundancy and conflicts within existing state law regarding life cycle cost analysis and recommend the resolution of any problems which are identified.\n\n4. It is the intent of the general assembly to discourage construction of public buildings based upon lowest acquisition cost, and instead to require that such decisions be based upon life cycle costs to reduce energy consumption, maintenance requirements, and continuing burdens upon taxpayers.\n\n90 Acts, ch 1252, §5; 94 Acts, ch 1173, §5; 2004 Acts, ch 1086, §17; 2006 Acts, ch 1014, §1; 2007 Acts, ch 22, §17; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2009 Acts, ch 108, §5, 41; 2011 Acts, ch 118, §50, 89; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1484\n\nReferred to in §476.10B\n\nSubsection 2 amended",
