Any registered voter, under the circumstances specified in section 53.1, may on any day, except election day, and not more than seventy days prior to the date of the election, apply in person for an absentee ballot at the commissioner’s office or at any location designated by the commissioner. However, for those elections in which the commissioner directs the polls be opened at noon pursuant to section 49.73, a voter may apply in person for an absentee ballot at the commissioner’s office from 8:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. on election day.\n\nb. A registered voter may make written application to the commissioner for an absentee ballot. A written application for an absentee ballot must be received by the commissioner no later than 5:00 p.m. on the same day as the voter registration deadline provided in section 48A.9 for the election for which the ballot is requested, except when the absentee ballot is requested and voted at the commissioner’s office pursuant to section 53.10. A written application for an absentee ballot delivered to the commissioner and received by the commissioner more than seventy days prior to the date of the election shall be returned to the voter with a notification of the date when the applications will be accepted.\n\nc. The commissioner may send an absentee ballot application to a registered voter at the request of the registered voter. The commissioner shall not send an absentee ballot application to a person who has not submitted such a request.\n\nd. In the event of a public health disaster declared by the governor pursuant to section 29C.6, the general assembly may by resolution direct the state commissioner to send an absentee ballot application to each registered voter prior to a primary or general election held in an even-numbered year. If the general assembly is not in session, the legislative council may so direct the state commissioner by a majority vote.\n\n2. a. The state commissioner shall prescribe a form for absentee ballot applications. However, if a registered voter submits an application on a sheet of paper no smaller than three by five inches in size that includes all of the information required in this section, the prescribed form is not required.\n\nb. Absentee ballot applications may include instructions to send the application directly to the county commissioner of elections. However, no absentee ballot application shall be preaddressed or printed with instructions to send the applications to anyone other than the appropriate commissioner.\n\nc. No absentee ballot application shall be preaddressed or printed with instructions to send the ballot to anyone other than the voter.\n\nd. No absentee ballot application shall be provided to a registered voter with any field prefilled, except that the absentee ballot application may have the fields for the type and date of the election prefilled.\n\n3. This section does not require that a written communication mailed to the commissioner’s office to request an absentee ballot, or any other document be notarized as a prerequisite to receiving or marking an absentee ballot or returning to the commissioner an absentee ballot which has been voted.\n\n4. a. To request an absentee ballot, a registered voter shall provide:\n\n(1) The name and signature of the registered voter and the date on which the request was signed.\n\n(2) The registered voter’s date of birth.\n\n(3) The address at which the voter is registered to vote.\n\n(4) The registered voter’s voter verification number.\n\n(5) The name or date of the election for which the absentee ballot is requested.\n\n(6) Such other information as may be necessary to determine the correct absentee ballot for the registered voter.\n\nb. If insufficient information has been provided, including the absence of a voter verification number, either on the prescribed form or on an application created by the applicant, the commissioner shall, within twenty-four hours after the receipt of the absentee ballot request, contact the applicant by telephone and electronic mail, if such information has been provided by the applicant. If the commissioner is unable to contact the applicant by telephone or electronic mail, the commissioner shall send a notice to the applicant at the address where the applicant is registered to vote, or to the applicant’s mailing address if it is different from the residential address. If the applicant has requested the ballot to be sent to an address that is not the applicant’s residential or mailing address, the commissioner shall send an additional notice to the address where the applicant requested the ballot to be sent. A commissioner shall not use the voter registration system to obtain additional necessary information. A voter requesting or casting a ballot pursuant to section 53.22 shall not be required to provide a voter verification number.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection, “voter verification number” means the registered voter’s driver’s license number or nonoperator’s identification card number assigned to the voter by the department of transportation or the registered voter’s identification number assigned to the voter by the state commissioner pursuant to section 47.7, subsection 2.\n\nd. If an applicant does not have current access to the applicant’s voter verification number, the commissioner shall verify the applicant’s identity prior to supplying the voter verification number by asking the applicant to provide at least two of the following facts about the applicant:\n\n(1) Date of birth.\n\n(2) The last four digits of the applicant’s social security number, if applicable.\n\n(3) Residential address.\n\n(4) Mailing address.\n\n(5) Middle name.\n\n(6) Voter verification number as defined in paragraph “c”.\n\n5. The commissioner may dispute an application if it appears to the commissioner that the signature on the application has been signed by someone other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on the application to the signature on record of the registered voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes a registered voter’s application under this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the registered voter and the registered voter may submit a new application and signature or update the registered voter’s signature on record, as provided by rule adopted by the state commissioner.\n\n6. An application for a primary election ballot which specifies a party different from that recorded on the registered voter’s voter registration record, or if the voter’s voter registration record does not indicate a party affiliation, shall be accepted as a change or declaration of party affiliation. The commissioner shall approve the change or declaration and enter a notation of the change on the registration records at the time the absentee ballot request is noted on the voter’s registration record. A notice shall be sent with the ballot requested informing the voter that the voter’s registration record will be changed to show that the voter is now affiliated with the party whose ballot the voter requested. If an application for a primary election ballot does not specify a party and the voter registration record of the voter from whom the application is received shows that the voter is affiliated with a party, the voter shall be mailed the ballot of the party indicated on the voter’s registration record.\n\n7. If an application for an absentee ballot is received from an eligible elector who is not a registered voter the commissioner shall send the eligible elector a voter registration form and another absentee ballot application form. If the application is received after the time registration closes pursuant to section 48A.9 but by 5:00 p.m. on the Saturday before the election for general elections or by 5:00 p.m. on the Friday before the election for all other elections, the commissioner shall notify the applicant by mail of the election day and in-person absentee registration provisions of section 48A.7A. In addition to notification by mail, the commissioner shall also attempt to contact the applicant by any other method available to the commissioner.\n\n8. A registered voter who has not moved from the county in which the elector is registered to vote may submit a change of name, telephone number, or address on the absentee ballot application form when requesting an absentee ballot. The commissioner may also update a voter’s identification number, as described in section 48A.11, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, if an identification number is provided on an absentee ballot application. Upon receipt of a properly completed form, the commissioner shall enter a notation of the change on the registration records.\n\n9. An application for an absentee ballot that is returned to the commissioner by a person acting as an actual or implied agent for a political party, as defined in section 43.2, or by a candidate or committee, both as defined by chapter 68A, shall be returned to the commissioner within seventy-two hours of the time the completed application was received from the applicant or no later than 5:00 p.m. on the same day as the deadline under subsection 1, paragraph “b”, whichever is earlier. An application received by a person acting as an actual or implied agent of a political party after the deadline but before the date of the election shall be returned to the commissioner within twenty-four hours.\n\n10. A registered voter who is a program participant under section 9E.6 may register to vote as an absentee voter with the state commissioner of elections pursuant to section 9E.6, subsection 2.\n\n11. If an application for an absentee ballot is received between 5:00 p.m. on the fifteenth day before an election and 5:00 p.m. on the seventh day before an election, the commissioner shall notify the registered voter within twenty-four hours that the absentee ballot request cannot be processed and notify the registered voter of ways the registered voter may participate in the election. A notification sent pursuant to this subsection shall be transmitted in the same manner as a notification transmitted pursuant to subsection 4, paragraph “b”.\n\n[SS15, §1137-c, -d; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §928, 930; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, §53.2, 53.4; C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §53.2]\n\n83 Acts, ch 176, §6; 84 Acts, ch 1291, §11; 86 Acts, ch 1224, §28; 87 Acts, ch 221, §25; 91 Acts, ch 129, §17; 94 Acts, ch 1169, §54; 95 Acts, ch 189, §15; 97 Acts, ch 170, §68; 2004 Acts, ch 1083, §28, 29, 37; 2007 Acts, ch 59, §23, 38; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §157; 2008 Acts, ch 1053, §1, 2; 2009 Acts, ch 57, §61; 2010 Acts, ch 1033, §29, 56; 2014 Acts, ch 1101, §15, 32; 2015 Acts, ch 96, §10, 17; 2017 Acts, ch 110, §6, 11, 30, 35, 36\n\n; 2017 Acts, ch 170, §26\n\n; 2020 Acts, ch 1121, §123 – 125; 2021 Acts, ch 12, §43 – 45, 73; 2021 Acts, ch 147, §39, 54\n\nReferred to in §22.7(72), 53.22, 53.39, 53.45, 53.49",

For purposes of this section, “assisted living program” means a program certified pursuant to section 231C.3 that meets the standards for a dementia-specific assisted living program, as established by rule by the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing.\n\n2. a. (1) A registered voter who has applied for an absentee ballot, in a manner other than that prescribed by section 53.10 or 53.11, and who is a resident, tenant, or patient in a health care facility, assisted living program, or hospital located in the county to which the application has been submitted shall be delivered the appropriate absentee ballot by two special precinct election officers, one of whom shall be a member of each of the political parties referred to in section 49.13, who shall be appointed by the commissioner from the election board panel for the special precinct established by section 53.20. The special precinct election officers shall be sworn in the manner provided by section 49.75 for election board members, shall receive compensation as provided in section 49.20, and shall perform their duties during the ten calendar days after the ballots are printed if the commissioner so elects, during the fourteen calendar days preceding the election, and on election day if all ballots requested under section 53.8, subsection 3, have not previously been delivered and returned.\n\n(2) If materials are prepared for the two special precinct election officials, a list shall be made of all voters to whom ballots are to be delivered. The list shall be sent with the officials who deliver the ballots and shall include spaces to indicate whether the person was present at the hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility when the officials arrived, whether the person requested assistance from the officials, whether the person was assisted by another person of the voter’s choice, the time that the ballot was returned to the officials, and any other notes the officials deem necessary.\n\n(3) The officials shall also be issued a supply of extra ballots to replace spoiled ballots. Receipts shall be issued in substantially the same form as receipts issued to precinct election officials pursuant to section 49.65. All ballots shall be accounted for and shall be returned to the commissioner. Separate envelopes shall be provided for the return of spoiled ballots and unused ballots.\n\nb. If an applicant under this subsection notifies the commissioner that the applicant will not be available at the health care facility, assisted living program, or hospital address at any time during the ten-day period after the ballots are printed, if applicable, or during the fourteen-day period immediately prior to the election, but will be available there at some other time prior to the election or on election day, the commissioner shall direct the two special precinct election officers to deliver the applicant’s ballot at an appropriate time preceding the election or on election day. If a person who so requested an absentee ballot has been dismissed from the health care facility or hospital, or is no longer a tenant of the assisted living program, the special precinct election officers may take the ballot to the voter if the voter is currently residing in the county.\n\nc. The special precinct election officers shall travel together in the same vehicle and both shall be present when an applicant casts an absentee ballot. If either or both of the special precinct election officers fail to appear at the time the duties set forth in this section are to be performed, the commissioner shall at once appoint some other person, giving preference to persons designated by the respective county chairpersons of the political parties described in section 49.13, to carry out the requirements of this section. The persons authorized by this subsection to deliver an absentee ballot to an applicant, if requested, may assist the applicant in filling out the ballot as permitted by section 49.90. After the voter has securely sealed the marked ballot in the envelope provided and has subscribed to the oath, the voted absentee ballots shall be deposited in a sealed container which shall be returned to the commissioner on the same day the ballots are voted. On election day the officers shall return the sealed container by the time the polls are closed.\n\n3. Any registered voter who becomes a patient, tenant, or resident of a hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility in the county where the voter is registered to vote after the deadline to make a written application for an absentee ballot as provided in section 53.2 or on election day may request an absentee ballot during that period or on election day. As an alternative to the application procedure prescribed by section 53.2, the registered voter may make the request directly to the officers who are delivering and returning absentee ballots under this section. Alternatively, the request may be made by telephone to the office of the commissioner not later than four hours before the close of the polls. If the requester is found to be a registered voter of that county, these officers shall deliver the appropriate absentee ballot to the registered voter in the manner prescribed by this section.\n\n4. For any election except a primary or general election or a special election to fill a vacancy under section 69.14, the commissioner may, as an alternative to subsection 2, mail an absentee ballot to an applicant under this section to be voted and returned to the commissioner in accordance with this chapter. This subsection only applies to applications for absentee ballots from a single health care facility, assisted living program, or hospital if there are no more than two applications from that facility, program, or hospital.\n\n5. The commissioner shall mail an absentee ballot to a registered voter who has applied for an absentee ballot and who is a patient, tenant, or resident of a hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility outside the county in which the voter is registered to vote.\n\n6. a. If the registered voter becomes a patient, tenant, or resident of a hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility outside the county where the voter is registered to vote after the deadline to make a written application for an absentee ballot as provided in section 53.2 or on election day, the voter may designate a person to deliver and return the absentee ballot. The designee shall be a person not prohibited to collect and deliver a completed ballot pursuant to section 53.33. The request for an absentee ballot may be made by telephone to the office of the commissioner not later than four hours before the close of the polls. If the requester is found to be a registered voter of that county, the ballot shall be delivered by mail or by the person designated by the voter. An application form shall be included with the absentee ballot and shall be signed by the voter and returned with the ballot.\n\nb. Absentee ballots voted under this subsection shall be delivered to the commissioner no later than the time the polls are closed on election day. If the ballot is returned by mail the return envelope must be received by the time the polls close, or be clearly postmarked by an officially authorized postal service or bear a postal service barcode traceable to a date of entry into the federal mail system not later than the day before the election, as provided in section 53.17A, and received by the commissioner no later than the time established for the canvass by the board of supervisors for that election.\n\n7. Observers representing candidates, political parties, or nonparty political organizations, or observers who are opponents or proponents of a ballot issue to be voted on at the election are prohibited from being present at a hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility during the time the special precinct election officers are delivering absentee ballots to the patients, tenants, or residents of such hospital, assisted living program, or health care facility.\n\n8.

The election board of the absentee ballot and special voters precinct shall be appointed by the commissioner in the manner prescribed by sections 49.12 and 49.13, except that the number of precinct election officials appointed to the board shall be sufficient to complete the counting of absentee ballots by 10:00 p.m. on election day.\n\n2. The board’s powers and duties shall be the same as those provided in chapter 50 for precinct election officials in regular precinct polling places. However, the election board of the special precinct shall receive from the commissioner and count all absentee ballots for all precincts in the county; when two or more political subdivisions in the county hold elections simultaneously the special precinct election board shall count absentee ballots cast in all of the elections so held. The tally list shall be recorded on forms prescribed by the state commissioner.\n\n3. a. The commissioner shall set the convening time for the board, allowing a reasonable amount of time to complete counting all absentee ballots by 10:00 p.m. on election day.\n\nb. (1) The commissioner may direct the board to meet on the day before the election for the purpose of reviewing the absentee voters’ affidavits appearing on the sealed envelopes. If in the commissioner’s judgment this procedure is necessary due to the number of absentee ballots received, the members of the board may open the sealed affidavit envelopes and remove the secrecy envelope containing the ballot, but under no circumstances shall a secrecy envelope or a return envelope marked with an affidavit be opened before the board convenes on election day, except as provided in paragraph “c”. If the affidavit envelopes are opened before election day pursuant to this paragraph “b”, the observers appointed by each political party, as defined in section 43.2, shall witness the proceedings. Each political party may appoint up to five observers under this paragraph “b”. The observers shall be appointed by the county chairperson or, if the county chairperson fails to make an appointment, by the state chairperson. However, if either or both political parties fail to appoint an observer, the commissioner may continue with the proceedings.\n\n(2) If the board finds any ballot not enclosed in a secrecy envelope and the ballot is folded in such a way that any of the votes cast on the ballot are visible, the two special precinct election officials, one from each of the two political parties referred to in section 49.13, subsection 2, shall place the ballot in a secrecy envelope. No one shall examine the ballot, except as provided in paragraph “c”.\n\nc. The commissioner may convene the special precinct election board on the day before the election to begin counting absentee ballots. However, if in the preceding general election the counting of absentee ballots was not completed by 10:00 p.m. on election day, the commissioner shall convene the special precinct election board on the day before the next general election to begin counting absentee ballots. The board shall not release the results of its tabulation pursuant to this paragraph until the count is completed on election day.\n\n4. The room where members of the special precinct election board are engaged in counting absentee ballots on the day before the election pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “c”, or during the hours the polls are open shall be policed so as to prevent any person other than those whose presence is authorized by this subsection from obtaining information about the progress of the count. The only persons who may be admitted to that room are the members of the board, five challengers representing each political party, one observer representing any nonparty political organization or any candidate nominated by petition pursuant to chapter 45 or any other nonpartisan candidate in a city or school election appearing on the ballot of the election in progress, one observer representing persons supporting a public measure appearing on the ballot and one observer representing persons opposed to such measure, and the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee. It shall be unlawful for any of these persons to communicate or attempt to communicate, directly or indirectly, information regarding the progress of the count at any time while the board is convened pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “c”, or at any time before the polls are closed.\n\n5. The special precinct election board shall preserve the secrecy of all absentee and provisional ballots. After the affidavits on the envelopes have been reviewed and the qualifications of the persons casting the ballots have been determined, those that have been accepted for counting shall be opened. The ballots shall be removed from the affidavit envelopes or return envelopes marked with the affidavit, as applicable, without being unfolded or examined, and then shall be thoroughly intermingled, after which they shall be unfolded and tabulated. If secrecy folders or envelopes are used with provisional paper ballots, the ballots shall be removed from the secrecy folders after the ballots have been intermingled.\n\n6. The special precinct election board shall not release the results of its tabulation on election day until all of the ballots it is required to count on that day have been counted, nor release the tabulation of provisional ballots accepted and counted under chapter 50 until that count has been completed.\n\n[SS15, §1137-j; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §949; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §53.23]\n\n90 Acts, ch 1238, §30; 92 Acts, ch 1163, §13; 95 Acts, ch 189, §16; 97 Acts, ch 170, §73; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §23; 2007 Acts, ch 59, §29, 38; 2007 Acts, ch 215, §232; 2008 Acts, ch 1115, §104; 2009 Acts, ch 140, §1; 2014 Acts, ch 1101, §22, 23, 32; 2017 Acts, ch 110, §9, 10; 2021 Acts, ch 12, §63, 73\n\nReferred to in §9E.6, 39A.1, 39A.4, 39A.5, 48A.7A, 50.20, 50.22, 50.50, 53.20, 53.30, 53.31, 53.49",

Any member of the armed forces of the United States may request ballots for all elections to be held during a calendar year.

The commissioner shall immediately on the forty-fifth day prior to the particular election transmit ballots to the voter by mail or otherwise, postage prepaid, as directed by the state commissioner, requests for which are in the commissioner’s hands at that time, and thereafter so transmit ballots immediately upon receipt of requests.
