The state commissioner of elections may exercise emergency powers over any election being held in a district in which either a natural or other disaster or extremely inclement weather has occurred. The state commissioner’s decision to alter any conduct for an election using emergency powers must be approved by the legislative council. If the legislative council does not approve the secretary of state’s use of emergency powers to conduct an election, the legislative council may choose to present and approve its own election procedures or choose to take no further action. The state commissioner of elections may also exercise emergency powers during an armed conflict involving United States armed forces, or mobilization of those forces, or if an election contest court finds that there were errors in the conduct of an election making it impossible to determine the result.\n\nb. If an emergency exists in all precincts of a county, the number of polling places shall not be reduced by more than thirty-five percent. The polling places allowed to open shall be equitably distributed in the county based on the ratio of regular polling places located in unincorporated areas in the county to regular polling places in incorporated areas in the county.\n\n3.

In complaint proceedings in which one of the respondents is the state commissioner of elections, the presiding officer shall be a panel consisting of all members of the state voter registration commission appointed pursuant to section 47.8, except the state commissioner of elections or the state commissioner’s designee.\n\n6. The state commissioner may, at the state commissioner’s discretion, examine the records of a commissioner to evaluate complaints and to ensure compliance with the provisions of chapters 39 through 53. This examination shall include assessments conducted or authorized by private or government entities to evaluate a county’s security readiness for elections-related technology or physical facilities. The state commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to require a commissioner to provide written explanations related to examinations conducted pursuant to this subsection.

By the forty-first day prior to the election, the controlling commissioner shall certify the names of candidates and the text and summary of any public measure being submitted to the electorate to all county commissioners of elections required to conduct elections for the political subdivision. The county commissioners of elections of the other counties in which the political subdivision is located shall cooperate with the controlling commissioner.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, for a city primary election, city runoff election, or a special election for a city, school district, or merged area, if a political subdivision is located in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections of a county not having the greatest taxable base within the political subdivision may designate that the controlling commissioner of the political subdivision shall conduct that election if fewer than one hundred twenty-five registered voters of the political subdivision are located within such county commissioner’s county. If the controlling commissioner is so designated, section 50.24, subsections 4 and 5, shall not apply. For the purposes of this paragraph, the number of registered voters shall be the number of registered voters in the political subdivision of a county not having the greatest taxable base on May 1 immediately preceding the first day of the filing period for candidates for the election. If May 1 falls on a day when the county commissioner’s office is closed for business, the county commissioner shall use the number of registered voters on the next day that the county commissioner’s office is open for business to determine the number of registered voters.\n\n3. The commissioner may designate as a deputy county commissioner of elections any officer of a political subdivision who is required by law to accept nomination papers filed by candidates for office in that political subdivision, and when so designated that person shall assist the commissioner in administering elections conducted by the commissioner for that subdivision.

The county commissioner shall not participate in an absentee ballot drive or collection effort in cooperation with a candidate, candidate’s committee, political party, or nonparty political organization. However, when a county commissioner is a candidate for election, such a county commissioner may participate in an absentee ballot drive or collection effort, but shall not aid any other candidate, candidate’s committee, political party, or nonparty political organization.\n\n[C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §47.2; 81 Acts, ch 34, §9]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1291, §3; 89 Acts, ch 136, §31; 94 Acts, ch 1169, §46; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2017 Acts, ch 155, §15, 44; 2019 Acts, ch 148, §21, 33, 38, 39; 2021 Acts, ch 12, §19, 73\n\nReferred to in §39.3, 44.4, 48A.2, 50.11, 50.24, 52.25, 68A.102, 260C.15, 260C.22, 260C.28, 277.20, 331.661, 331.753, 376.4, 376.6, 376.7, 376.9",

Except for legal services and printing of ballots, the commissioner shall take bids for goods and services which are needed in connection with registration of voters or preparation for or administration of elections and which will be performed or provided by persons who are not employees of the commissioner under the following circumstances:\n\na. In any case where it is proposed to purchase data processing services. The commissioner shall give the registrar written notice in advance on each occasion when it is proposed to have data processing services, necessary in connection with the administration of elections, performed by any person other than the registrar or an employee of the county. Such notice shall be made at least thirty days prior to publication of the specifications.\n\nb. In all other cases, where the cost of the goods or services to be purchased will exceed one thousand dollars.\n\n2. When it is proposed to purchase any goods or services, other than data processing services, in connection with administration of elections, the commissioner shall publish notice to bidders, including specifications regarding the goods or services to be purchased or a description of the nature and object of the services to be retained, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county not less than fifteen days before the final date for submission of bids. When competitive bidding procedures are used, the purchase of goods or services shall be made from the lowest responsible bidder which meets the specifications or description of the services needed or the commissioner may reject all bids and readvertise. In determining the lowest responsible bidder, various factors may be considered, including but not limited to the past performance of the bidder relative to quality of product or service, the past experience of the purchaser in relation to the product or service, the relative quality of products or services, the proposed terms of delivery and the best interest of the county.\n\n3. The procedure for purchasing data processing services in connection with administration of elections is the same as prescribed in subsection 2, except that the required copy of the bid specifications shall be filed with the registrar rather than the state commissioner. The specifications for data processing contracts relative to voter registration records shall be specified by the registration commission. The registrar shall, not later than the final date for submission of bids, inform the commissioner in writing whether the department of administrative services data processing facilities are currently capable of furnishing the services the county proposes to purchase, and if so the cost to the county of so obtaining the services as determined in accordance with the standard charges adopted by the registration commission. The commissioner, with approval of the board of supervisors, may reject all bids and enter into an arrangement with the registrar for the services to be furnished by the state. The commissioner may recommend and the board of supervisors may approve purchasing the needed services from the lowest responsible bidder; however, if the needed services could be obtained through the registrar at a lower cost, the board shall publish notice twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of its intent to accept such bid and of the difference in the amount of the bid and the cost of purchasing the needed services from the department of administrative services data processing facilities through the registrar. Each contract for the furnishing of data processing services necessary in connection with the administration of elections, by any person other than the registrar or an employee of the county, shall be executed with the contractor by the board of supervisors of the county purchasing the services, but only after the contract has been reviewed and approved by the registration commission. The contract shall be of not more than one year’s duration. Each county exercising the option to purchase such data processing services from a provider other than the registrar shall provide the registrar, at the county’s expense, original and updated voter registration lists in a form and at times prescribed by rules adopted by the registration commission.\n\n4. Any election or registration data or records which may be in the possession of a contractor shall remain the property of the commissioner. Contracts with a private person relating to the maintenance and use of voter registration data, which were properly entered into in compliance with this section and with all other laws relating to bidding on such contracts, shall remain in force only until the most recently negotiated termination date of that contract.

Otherwise, the notice shall be given at least forty-six days in advance of the date of the proposed special election.\n\n(2) Upon receiving the notice, the commissioner shall promptly give written approval of the proposed date unless it appears that the special election, if held on that date, would conflict with a regular election or with another special election previously scheduled for that date.\n\nb. A public measure shall not be withdrawn from the ballot at any election if the public measure was placed on the ballot by a petition, or if the election is a special election called specifically for the purpose of deciding one or more public measures for a single political subdivision. However, a public measure which was submitted to the county commissioner of elections by the governing body of a political subdivision may be withdrawn by the governing body which submitted the public measure if the public measure was to be placed on the ballot of a regularly scheduled election. The notice of withdrawal must be made by resolution of the governing body and must be filed with the commissioner no later than the last day upon which a candidate may withdraw from the ballot.\n\n2. For the purpose of this section, a conflict between two elections exists only when some but not all of the registered voters of any precinct would be entitled to vote in one of the elections and all of the registered voters of the same precinct would be entitled to vote in the other election. Nothing in this subsection shall deny a commissioner discretionary authority to approve holding a special election on the same date as another election, even though the two elections may be defined as being in conflict, if the commissioner concludes that to do so will cause no undue difficulties.\n\n3. a.

Candidates for city offices in cities in which a primary election may be necessary shall file their nomination papers with the city clerk not later than 5:00 p.m. on the fifty-fourth day before the election.
