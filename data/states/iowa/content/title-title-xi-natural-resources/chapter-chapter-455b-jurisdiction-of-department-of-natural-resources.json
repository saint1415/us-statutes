Develop comprehensive plans and programs for the abatement, control, and prevention of air pollution in this state, recognizing varying requirements for different areas in the state. The plans may include emission limitations, schedules and timetables for compliance with the limitations, measures to prevent the significant deterioration of air quality and other measures as necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards.\n\n2. Adopt, amend, or repeal rules pertaining to the evaluation, abatement, control, and prevention of air pollution. The rules may include those that are necessary to obtain approval of the state implementation plan under section 110 of the federal Clean Air Act as amended through January 1, 1991.\n\n3. Adopt, amend, or repeal ambient air quality standards for the atmosphere of this state on the basis of providing air quality necessary to protect the public health and welfare and to reduce emissions contributing to acid rain pursuant to Tit. IV of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n4. Adopt, amend, or repeal emission limitations or standards relating to the maximum quantities of air contaminants that may be emitted from any air contaminant source. The standards or limitations adopted under this section shall not exceed the standards or limitations promulgated by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency or the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act as amended through January 1, 1991. This does not prohibit the commission from adopting a standard for a source or class of sources for which the United States environmental protection agency has not promulgated a standard. This also does not prohibit the commission from adopting an emission standard or limitation for infectious medical waste treatment or disposal facilities which exceeds the standards or limitations promulgated by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency or the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act as amended through January 1, 1991. The commission shall not adopt an emission standard or limitation for infectious medical waste treatment or disposal facilities prior to January 1, 1995, which exceeds the standards or limitations promulgated by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency or the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended through January 1, 1991, for a hospital, or a group of hospitals, licensed under chapter 135B which has been operating an infectious medical waste treatment or disposal facility prior to January 1, 1991.\n\na. (1) The commission shall establish standards of performance unless in the judgment of the commission it is not feasible to adopt or enforce a standard of performance. If it is not feasible to adopt or enforce a standard of performance, the commission may adopt a design, equipment, material, work practice or operational standard, or combination of those standards in order to establish reasonably available control technology or the lowest achievable emission rate in nonattainment areas, or in order to establish best available control technology in areas subject to prevention of significant deterioration review, or in order to adopt the emission limitations promulgated by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency under section 111 or 112 of the federal Clean Air Act as amended through January 1, 1991.\n\n(2) If a person establishes to the satisfaction of the commission that an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of an air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of the air pollutant achieved under the design, equipment, material, work practice or operational standard, the commission shall amend its rules to permit the use of the alternative by the source for purposes of compliance with this paragraph with respect to the pollutant.\n\n(3) A design, equipment, material, work practice or operational standard promulgated under this paragraph shall be promulgated in terms of a standard of performance when it becomes feasible to promulgate and enforce the standard in those terms.\n\n(4) For the purpose of this paragraph, the phrase “not feasible to adopt or enforce a standard of performance” refers to a situation in which the commission determines that the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations.\n\nb. The degree of emission limitation required for control of an air contaminant under an emission standard shall not be affected by that part of the stack height of a source that exceeds good engineering practice, as defined in rules, or any other dispersion technique. This paragraph shall not apply to stack heights in existence before December 30, 1970, or dispersion techniques implemented before that date.\n\n5. Classify air contaminant sources according to levels and types of emissions, and other characteristics which relate to air pollution. The commission may require, by rule, the owner or operator of any air contaminant source to establish and maintain such records, make such reports, install, use and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods, sample such emissions in accordance with such methods at such locations and intervals, and using such procedures as the commission shall prescribe, and provide such other information as the commission may reasonably require. Such classifications may be for application to the state as a whole, or to any designated area of the state, and shall be made with special reference to effects on health, economic and social factors, and physical effects on property.\n\n6. a. Require, by rules, notice of the construction of any air contaminant source which may cause or contribute to air pollution, and the submission of plans and specifications to the department, or other information deemed necessary, for the installation of air contaminant sources and related control equipment. The rules relating to major stationary sources shall allow the submission of engineering descriptions, flow diagrams and schematics that quantitatively and qualitatively identify emission streams and alternative control equipment that will provide compliance with emission standards. Such rules shall not specify any particular method to be used to reduce undesirable levels of emissions, nor type, design, or method of installation of any equipment to be used to reduce such levels of emissions, nor the type, design, or method of installation or type of construction of any manufacturing processes or kinds of equipment, nor specify the kind or composition of fuels permitted to be sold, stored, or used unless authorized by subsection 4 of this section.\n\nb. The commission may give technical advice pertaining to the construction or installation of the equipment or any other recommendation.\n\n7. Commission rules establishing maximum permissible sulfate content shall not apply to an expansion of an industrial anaerobic lagoon facility which was constructed prior to February 22, 1979.\n\n8. a. (1) Adopt rules consistent with the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549, including those amendments effective on January 1, 1991, regulations promulgated by the United States environmental protection agency pursuant to that Act, the provisions of this chapter, and rules adopted by the commission pursuant to this chapter, which require the owner or operator of an air contaminant source to obtain an operating permit prior to operation of the source. The rules shall specify the information required to be submitted with the application for an operating permit and the conditions under which a permit may be granted, modified, suspended, terminated, revoked, reissued, or denied. For sources subject to the provisions of Tit. IV of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, operating permit conditions shall include emission allowances for sulfur dioxide emissions.\n\n(2) (a) The commission may establish fees to be imposed and collected by the department, including operating permit application fees and fees upon regulated pollutants emitted from an air contaminant source, in an amount sufficient to cover, on a state fiscal year basis as described in section 455B.133B, all reasonable costs, direct and indirect, required to implement and administer the operating permit program as described in subparagraph (1) in conformance with the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Affected units regulated under Tit. IV of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 shall pay fees in the same manner as other sources subject to operating permit requirements, except as provided in section 408 of that Act.\n\n(b) The fees collected by the department pursuant to subparagraph division (a) shall be credited to the appropriate accounts of the air contaminant source fund created pursuant to section 455B.133B, and shall be utilized to cover all reasonable costs required to implement and administer the programs required by Tit. V of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, including the operating permit program pursuant to section 502 of that Act and the small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program pursuant to section 507 of that Act. The amount of the fees credited to and expended from each account of the air contaminant source fund shall be subject to the limitations provided in section 455B.133B.\n\n(c) Fees established pursuant to this subparagraph (2) shall not be imposed for the regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nb. Adopt rules allowing the department to issue a state operating permit to an owner or operator of an air contaminant source. The state operating permit granted under this paragraph may only be issued at the request of an air contaminant source and will be used to limit its potential to emit to less than one hundred tons per year of a criteria pollutant as defined by the United States environmental protection agency or ten tons per year of a hazardous air pollutant or twenty-five tons of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.\n\nc. Adopt rules for the issuance of a single general permit, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing. The single general permit shall cover numerous sources to the extent that the sources are representative of a class of facilities which can be identified and conditioned by a single permit.\n\n9. Adopt rules allowing asphalt shingles to be burned in a fire set for the purpose of bona fide training of public or industrial employees in fire fighting methods only if a notice is provided to the director containing testing results indicating that the asphalt shingles do not contain asbestos. Each fire department shall be permitted to host two fires per year as allowed under this subsection.\n\n10. Adopt rules allowing a city to conduct a controlled burn of a demolished building subject to the requirements that are in effect for the proper removal of all asbestos-containing materials prior to demolition and burning. The rules shall include provisions that a burn site have controlled access, that a burn site be supervised by representatives of the city at all times, and that the burning be conducted only when weather conditions are favorable with respect to surrounding property. For a burn site located outside of a city, the rules shall include a provision that a city may undertake not more than one such controlled burn per day and that a burn site be limited to an area located at least six-tenths of a mile from any inhabited building. For burn sites located within a city, the rules shall include a provision that a city may undertake not more than one such controlled burn in every six-tenths-of-a-mile-radius circle in each calendar year. The rules shall prohibit a controlled burn of a demolished building in Cedar Rapids, Marion, Hiawatha, Council Bluffs, Carter Lake, Des Moines, West Des Moines, Clive, Windsor Heights, Urbandale, Pleasant Hill, Buffalo, Davenport, Mason City, or any other area where area-specific state implementation plans require the control of particulate matter.\n\n[C71, §136B.4; C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §455B.12; 82 Acts, ch 1124, §1]\n\nC83, §455B.133\n\n91 Acts, ch 242, §1; 91 Acts, ch 255, §8; 92 Acts, ch 1163, §87 – 89; 93 Acts, ch 137, §3; 94 Acts, ch 1040, §1; 95 Acts, ch 2, §1; 2002 Acts, ch 1162, §45\n\n; 2002 Acts, 2nd Ex, ch 1003, §241, 262\n\n; 2004 Acts, ch 1138, §1; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2014 Acts, ch 1010, §2; 2015 Acts, ch 30, §131; 2015 Acts, ch 100, §1, 7\n\nReferred to in §455B.133B, 455B.134",

Establish, modify, or repeal water quality standards, pretreatment standards, and effluent standards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\na. The effluent standards may provide for maintaining the existing quality of the water of the state that is a navigable water of the United States under the federal Water Pollution Control Act where the quality thereof exceeds the requirements of the water quality standards.\n\nb. If the federal environmental protection agency has promulgated an effluent standard or pretreatment standard pursuant to section 301, 306, or 307 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act, a pretreatment or effluent standard adopted pursuant to this section shall not be more stringent than the federal effluent or pretreatment standard for such source. This section may not preclude the establishment of a more restrictive effluent limitation in the permit for a particular point source if the more restrictive effluent limitation is necessary to meet water quality standards, the establishment of an effluent standard for a source or class of sources for which the federal environmental protection agency has not promulgated standards pursuant to section 301, 306, or 307 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act. Except as required by federal law or regulation, the commission shall not adopt an effluent standard more stringent with respect to any pollutant than is necessary to reduce the concentration of that pollutant in the effluent to the level due to natural causes, including the mineral and chemical characteristics of the land, existing in the water of the state to which the effluent is discharged. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 1 of subchapter III or chapter 459, subchapter III, any new source, the construction of which was commenced after October 18, 1972, and which was constructed as to meet all applicable standards of performance for the new source or any more stringent effluent limitation required to meet water quality standards, shall not be subject to any more stringent effluent limitations during a ten-year period beginning on the date of completion of construction or during the period of depreciation or amortization of the pollution control equipment for the facility for the purposes of section 167 or 169 or both sections of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever period ends first.\n\n3. Establish, modify, or repeal rules relating to the location, construction, operation, and maintenance of disposal systems and public water supply systems and specifying the conditions, including the viability of a system pursuant to section 455B.174, under which the director shall issue, revoke, suspend, modify, or deny permits for the operation, installation, construction, addition to, or modification of any disposal system or public water supply system, or for the discharge of any pollutant.\n\na. No rules shall be adopted which regulate the hiring or firing of operators of disposal systems or public water supply systems except rules which regulate the certification of operators as to their technical competency.\n\nb. A publicly owned treatment works whose discharge meets the final effluent limitations which were contained in its discharge permit on the date that construction of the publicly owned treatment works was approved by the department shall not be required to meet more stringent effluent limitations for a period of ten years from the date the construction was completed and accepted but not longer than twelve years from the date that construction was approved by the department.\n\n4. Cooperate with other state or interstate water pollution control agencies in establishing standards, objectives, or criteria for the quality of interstate waters originating or flowing through this state.\n\n5. Establish, modify, or repeal rules relating to drinking water standards for public water supply systems. Such standards shall specify maximum contaminant levels or treatment techniques necessary to protect the public health and welfare. The drinking water standards must assure compliance with federal drinking water standards adopted pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n6. Adopt rules relating to inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for the owner or operator of any public water supply or any disposal system or of any source which is an industrial user of a publicly or privately owned disposal system.\n\n7. Adopt a statewide plan for the provision of safe drinking water under emergency circumstances. All public agencies, as defined in chapter 28E, shall cooperate in the development and implementation of the plan. The plan shall detail the manner in which the various state and local agencies shall participate in the response to an emergency. The department may enter into any agreement, subject to approval of the commission, with any state agency or unit of local government or with the federal government which may be necessary to establish the role of such agencies in regard to the plan. This plan shall be coordinated with disaster emergency plans.\n\n8. Formulate and adopt specific and detailed statewide standards pursuant to chapter 17A for review of plans and specifications and the construction of sewer systems and water supply distribution systems and extensions to such systems not later than October 1, 1977. The standards shall be based on criteria contained in the “Recommended Standards for Sewage Works” and “Recommended Standards for Water Works” (Ten States Standards) as adopted by the Great Lakes – Upper Mississippi River board of state sanitary engineers, design manuals published by the department, applicable federal guidelines and standards, standard textbooks, current technical literature, and applicable safety standards. The rules adopted which directly pertain to the construction of sewer systems and water supply distribution systems and the review of plans and specifications for such construction shall be known respectively as the “Iowa Standards for Sewer Systems” and the “Iowa Standards for Water Supply Distribution Systems” and shall be applicable in each governmental subdivision of the state. Exceptions shall be made to the standards so formulated only upon special request to and receipt of permission from the department. The department shall publish the standards and make copies of such standards available to governmental subdivisions and to the public.\n\n9. Adopt, modify, or repeal rules relating to the construction and reconstruction of water wells, the proper abandonment of wells, and the registration or certification of water well contractors. The rules shall include those necessary to protect the public health and welfare, and to protect the waters of the state. The rules may include, but are not limited to, establishing fees for registration or certification of water well contractors, requiring the submission of well driller’s logs, formation samples or well cuttings, water samples, information on test pumping and requiring inspections.

Conduct investigations of alleged water pollution or of alleged violations of this part 1 of subchapter III, chapter 459, subchapter III, chapter 459A, or chapter 459B, or any rule adopted or any permit issued pursuant to this part 1 of subchapter III, chapter 459, subchapter III, chapter 459A, or chapter 459B, upon written request of any state agency, political subdivision, local board of health, twenty-five residents of the state, as directed by the department, or as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this part 1 of subchapter III, chapter 459, subchapter III, chapter 459A, or chapter 459B.\n\n2. Conduct periodic surveys and inspection of the construction, operation, self-monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of all public water supply systems and all disposal systems except as provided in section 455B.183.\n\n3. Take any action or actions allowed by law which, in the director’s judgment, are necessary to enforce or secure compliance with the provisions of this part 1 of subchapter III or chapter 459, subchapter III, or of any rule or standard established or permit issued pursuant to this part 1 of subchapter III or chapter 459, subchapter III.\n\n4. a. (1) Approve or disapprove the plans and specifications for the construction of disposal systems or public water supply systems except for those sewer extensions and water supply distribution system extensions which are reviewed by a city or county public works department as set forth in section 455B.183. The director shall issue, revoke, suspend, modify, or deny permits for the operation, installation, construction, addition to, or modification of any disposal system or public water supply system except for sewer extensions and water supply distribution system extensions which are reviewed by a city or county public works department as set forth in section 455B.183. The director shall also issue, revoke, suspend, modify, or deny permits for the discharge of any pollutant, or for the use or disposal of sewage sludge. The permits shall contain conditions and schedules of compliance as necessary to meet the requirements of this part 1 of subchapter III or chapter 459, subchapter III, the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. A permit issued under this chapter for the use or disposal of sewage sludge is in addition to and must contain references to any other permits required under this chapter. The director shall not issue or renew a permit to a disposal system or a public water supply system which is not viable. If the director has reasonable grounds to believe that a disposal system or public water supply system is not viable, the department may require the system to submit a business plan as a means of determining viability. This plan shall include the following components:\n\n(a) A facilities plan which describes proposed new facilities and the condition of existing facilities, rehabilitation and replacement needs, and future needs to meet the requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n(b) A management plan which consists of an administrative plan describing methods to assure performance of functions necessary to administer the system, including credentials of management personnel; and an operation and maintenance plan describing how all operating and maintenance duties necessary to the system’s proper function will be accomplished.\n\n(c) A financial plan which describes provisions for assuring that adequate revenues will be available to meet cash flow requirements, based on the full cost of providing the service, adequate initial capitalization, and access to additional capital for contingencies.\n\n(2) If, upon submission and review of the business plan, the department determines that the disposal system or public water supply system is not viable, the director may require the system to take actions to become viable within a time period established pursuant to section 455B.173, or to make alternative arrangements in providing treatment or water supply services as determined by rule.\n\nb. In addition to the requirements of paragraph “a”, a permit shall not be issued to operate or discharge from any disposal system unless the conditions of the permit assure that any discharge from the disposal system meets or will meet all applicable state and federal water quality standards and effluent standards and the issuance of the permit is not otherwise prohibited by the federal Water Pollution Control Act. All applications for discharge permits are subject to public notice and opportunity for public participation including public hearing as the department may by rule require. The director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of the director’s action and, if the permit is denied, state the reasons for denial. A person who is an applicant or permittee may contest the denial of a permit or any condition of a permit issued by the director if the person notifies the director within thirty days of the director’s notice of denial or issuance of the permit. Notwithstanding section 17A.11, subsection 1, if the applicant or permittee timely contests the director’s action, the presiding officer in the resulting contested case proceeding shall be an administrative law judge assigned by the division of administrative hearings pursuant to sections 10A.801 and 17A.11.\n\nc. Copies of all forms or other paper instruments required to be filed during on-site inspections or investigations shall be given to the owner or operator of the disposal system or public water supply system being investigated or inspected before the inspector or investigator leaves the site. Any other report, statement, or instrument shall not be filed with the department unless a copy is sent by ordinary mail to the owner or operator of the disposal system or public water supply system within ten working days of the filing. If an inspection or investigation is done in cooperation with another state department, the department involved and the areas inspected shall be stated.\n\nd. If a public water supply has a groundwater source that contains petroleum, a fraction of crude oil, or their degradation products, or is located in an area deemed by the department as likely to be contaminated by such materials, and after consultation with the public water supply system and consideration of all applicable rules relating to remediation, the department may require the public water supply system to replace that groundwater source in order to receive a permit to operate. The requirement to replace the source shall only be made by the department if the public water supply system is fully compensated for any additional design, construction, operation, and monitoring costs from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund created by chapter 455G or from any other funds that do not impose a financial obligation on the part of the public water supply system. Funds available to or provided by the public water supply system may be used for system improvements made in conjunction with replacement of the source. The department cannot require a public water supply system to replace its water source with a less reliable water source or with a source that does not meet federal primary, secondary, or other health-based standards unless treatment is provided to ensure that the drinking water meets these standards. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the public water supply system’s right to pursue recovery from a responsible party.\n\ne. The department may enter into an agreement with a county to delegate to the county the duties of the department under this subsection as they relate to the construction of semipublic sewage disposal systems.\n\n5. a. Periodically review permits and reports submitted by city and county public works departments in accordance with section 455B.183, subsection 3, to ensure such public works departments are complying with this part 1 of subchapter III. If a city or county public works department is not complying with section 455B.183 in reviewing plans and specifications or in granting permits or both, the department shall perform these functions in that jurisdiction until the city or county public works department is able to perform them. Performance of these functions in a jurisdiction by a local public works department shall not be suspended or revoked until after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided in chapter 17A.\n\nb. The department shall give technical assistance to city and county public works departments upon request of such local public works departments.\n\n[C97, §2565; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §2191; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, §135.11(7); C66, 71, §135.11(7), 455B.9 – 455B.11, 455B.15, 455B.17; C73, 75, §455B.33, 455B.37, 455B.66; C77, 79, 81, §455B.33; 82 Acts, ch 1050, §3]\n\nC83, §455B.174\n\n83 Acts, ch 137, §4; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §1899, 1899B; 92 Acts, ch 1041, §4; 96 Acts, ch 1079, §14; 97 Acts, ch 137, §4; 2004 Acts, ch 1175, §260; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §57; 2009 Acts, ch 155, §28, 34; 2010 Acts, ch 1029, §1; 2011 Acts, ch 97, §2; 2014 Acts, ch 1010, §8; 2018 Acts, ch 1023, §3; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §88 – 90; 2022 Acts, ch 1032, §66\n\nReferred to in §331.382, 357A.2, 455B.172, 455B.173, 455B.175, 455B.183A",

For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Base flow conditions” means the flow of a stream segment, as measured during the time period between July 1 and September 30, that occurs during a period of time when the watershed in which the stream segment is located receives no twenty-four-hour rainfall in excess of one-quarter inch total rainfall and not more than one-half inch total rainfall for the watershed in the preceding two weeks.\n\nb. “Credible data” means the same as defined in section 455B.171 and is subject to the same requirements as provided in section 455B.193 and may include, but not rely solely on, data that is older than five years and that is obtained pursuant to the best professional judgment of a professional designee or a state or federal agency.\n\nc. “Ephemeral stream” means a stream that flows only in response to precipitation and whose channel is primarily above the water table.\n\nd. “Professional designee” means the same as defined in section 455B.193.\n\ne. “Use attainability analysis” means a structured scientific assessment that includes physical, chemical, biological, and economic factors.\n\n2. A water of the state shall be a designated stream segment when any one of the following is met:\n\na. The most recent ten-year median flow is equal to or in excess of one cubic foot per second based on data collected and evaluated by the United States geological survey between July 1 and September 30 of each year or in the absence of stream segment flow data calculations of flow conducted by extrapolation methods provided by the United States geological survey or based upon a calculation method adopted by rule.\n\nb. The water is a critical habitat of a threatened or endangered aquatic specie as determined by the department or the United States fish and wildlife service.\n\nc. Credible data developed in accordance with section 455B.193 shows that water flows that are less than set out in paragraph “a” provide a refuge for aquatic life that permits biological recolonization of intermittently flowing segments.\n\n3. All waters of the state not designated as a stream segment shall be identified as a general stream segment and shall be subject to narrative water quality standards.\n\n4. a.

When reviewing whether a designated use is attainable, the department shall consider at a minimum the following:\n\n(1) Whether the natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels could inhibit recreational activities.\n\n(2) If opposite sides of a stream segment would have different designated recreational uses due to differences in public access, the designated use of the entire stream segment may be the higher attainable use.\n\n(3) The time period for determining primary contact recreation shall be March 15 through November 15.\n\n(4) The degree to which the public has access to the stream segment.\n\n(5) The minimum depth of the deepest pool.\n\n(6) Stream segments shall be protected for all existing uses as defined by the federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n\n5. The commission shall adopt rules designating water quality standards which shall be specific to each designated use adopted pursuant to subsection 4. The standards shall take into account the different characteristics of each designated use and shall provide for only the appropriate level of protection based upon that particular use. The standards shall not be identical for each designated use unless required for the appropriate level of protection. The appropriate level of protection and standards shall be determined on a scientific basis. In the development process for the water quality standards, input shall be received from a water quality standards advisory committee convened by the department. The water quality standards advisory committee shall be comprised of experts in the scientific fields relating to water quality, such as environmental engineering, aquatic toxicology, fisheries biology, and other life sciences and experts in the development of the appropriate levels of aquatic life protection and standards. The water quality standards shall be reviewed and revised by the department as new scientific data becomes available to support revision.\n\n6. Prior to any changes in a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit effluent limitation based upon a new use designation, the department or a designee of the department shall conduct a use attainability analysis. The commission shall adopt rules that establish procedures and criteria to be used in the development of a use attainability analysis. The rules shall, at a minimum, provide all of the following:\n\na. A designated use, which is not an existing use as defined by the federal Water Pollution Control Act, may be removed due to any of the following:\n\n(1) Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the use.\n\n(2) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without violating state water conservation requirements to enable uses to be met.\n\n(3) Human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place.\n\n(4) Dams, diversions, or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the water body to its original condition or to operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of the use.\n\n(5) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses.\n\n(6) Controls more stringent than those required by sections 1311(b) and 1316 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact.\n\nb. A designated use shall not be removed if any of the following occur:\n\n(1) The designated use is an existing use, as defined by the federal Water Pollution Control Act, unless a use requiring more stringent criteria is added.\n\n(2) Such uses will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under sections 1311(b) and 1316 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control.\n\nc. Where existing water quality standards specify designated uses less than those which are presently being attained, the commission shall revise its standards to reflect the uses actually being attained.\n\n7. a. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to administer this section. All new or revised stream segment use designations shall be adopted by rule. Any rule that establishes, modifies, or repeals existing water quality standards in this state shall be adopted in conformance with this section.\n\nb. (1) By December 31, 2006, the department shall publish a list of all designated stream segments that receive a permitted discharge for which a use attainability analysis for recreational use and aquatic life has not been completed and a list of all designated stream segments that receive a permitted discharge for which a use attainability analysis for recreational use and aquatic life has been completed and whether a recreational or aquatic use has been determined to be or not to be attainable. By December 31, 2007, a use attainability analysis shall be completed for all newly designated stream segments that receive a permitted discharge.\n\n(2) A use attainability analysis for a designated stream segment receiving a permitted discharge shall be conducted by either the department or a professional designee.\n\n(3) The department shall make public a written determination of whether a new or revised use designation is appropriate for the designated stream segment prior to adoption by rule of the proposed changes.\n\nc. The department shall complete, upon request, a use attainability analysis for recreational and aquatic uses on any designated stream segment not receiving a permitted discharge or on any previously designated stream segment in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(1) The department shall make public a written determination of whether a new or revised designated use is appropriate for the designated stream segment within ninety days of completion of the use attainability analysis prior to adoption by rule of the proposed changes.\n\n(2) The department shall accept a use attainability analysis submitted by someone other than a professional designee.\n\n(a) Within thirty days after receipt of submission of a use attainability analysis, the department shall review and provide a written determination of whether the documentation submitted is complete.\n\n(b) Within ninety days after receipt of submission of a completed use attainability analysis, the department shall review and make available to the public a written determination of whether a new or revised use designation is appropriate for the designated stream segment.\n\nd. Any regulated entity or property owner adjacent to the accessed stream segment aggrieved by such a determination may make a written request, within thirty days from the date the written determination of the appropriate use designation is made available to the public, for a meeting with the director or the director’s designee. A regulated entity or property owner adjacent to the accessed stream segment shall be allowed to provide evidence that the designation is not appropriate under the criteria as established in this subsection.\n\n8. An operation permit issued pursuant to section 455B.173 that expires before a use attainability analysis is performed shall remain in effect and the department shall not renew the permit until a use attainability analysis is completed. If a use attainability analysis demonstrates that a change in the use designation is warranted, the permit shall remain in effect and the department shall not renew the permit until the stream use designation is changed. In order for an expired permit to remain in effect, the permit holder must meet the requirements for a permit renewal. This subsection does not apply if the permit applicant and the department agree that the performance of a use attainability analysis presents no reasonable likelihood of resulting in a change to the existing stream use designations.\n\n2006 Acts, ch 1145, §3; 2009 Acts, ch 72, §12",

The commission may adopt additional exemptions for a class of disposal systems that do not discharge into a water of the state or the director may waive the permit requirement for an individual system that does not discharge into a water of the state. The commission or director shall consider the volume, location, frequency, and nature of disposal from a system or class of systems before granting a waiver or exemption. Sludge from a semipublic or private sewage disposal system shall be disposed of in accordance with the rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\n2. Upon adoption of standards by the commission pursuant to section 455B.173, subsections 5 through 8, plans and specifications for sewer extensions and water supply distribution system extensions covered by this section shall be submitted to the city or county public works department for approval if the local public works department employs or retains a qualified, licensed engineer who reviews the plans and specifications using the specific state standards known as the Iowa standards for sewer systems and the Iowa standards for water supply distribution systems that have been formulated and adopted by the commission pursuant to section 455B.173, subsections 5 through 8. The local agency shall issue a written permit to construct if all of the following apply:\n\na. The submitted plans and specifications are in substantial compliance with departmental rules and the Iowa standards for sewer systems and the Iowa standards for water supply distribution systems.\n\nb. The extensions primarily serve residential consumers and will not result in an increase greater than five percent of the capacity of the treatment works or serve more than two hundred fifty dwelling units or, in the case of an extension to a water supply distribution system, the extension will have a capacity of less than five percent of the system or will serve fewer than two hundred fifty dwelling units.\n\nc. The proposed sewer extension will not exceed the capacity of any treatment works which received a state or federal monetary grant after 1972.\n\nd. The proposed water supply distribution system extension will not exceed the production capacity of any public water supply system constructed after 1972.\n\n3. After issuing a permit, the city or county public works department shall notify the director of such issuance by forwarding a copy of the permit to the director. In addition, the local agency shall submit quarterly reports to the director including such information as capacity of local treatment plants and production capacity of public water supply systems as well as other necessary information requested by the director for the purpose of implementing this chapter.\n\n4. Plans and specifications for all other waste disposal systems and public water supply systems, including sewer extensions and water supply distribution system extensions not reviewed by a city or county public works department under this section, shall be submitted to the department before a written permit may be issued. Plans and specifications for public water supply systems and water supply distribution system extensions must be certified by a licensed engineer as provided in subsection 1, paragraph “a”. The construction of any such waste disposal system or public water supply system shall be in accordance with standards formulated and adopted by the commission pursuant to section 455B.173, subsections 5 through 8. If it is necessary or desirable to make material changes in the plans or specifications, revised plans or specifications together with reasons for the proposed changes must be submitted to the department for a supplemental written permit. The revised plans and specifications for a public water supply system must be certified by a licensed engineer as provided in subsection 1, paragraph “a”.\n\n5. Prior to the adoption of statewide standards, the department may delegate the authority to review plans and specifications to those governmental subdivisions if in addition to compliance with subsection 1, paragraph “c”, the governmental subdivisions agree to comply with all state and federal regulations and submit plans for the review of plans and specifications including a complete set of local standard specifications for such improvements.\n\n6. The director may suspend or revoke delegation of review and permit authority after notice and hearing as set forth in chapter 17A if the director determines that a city or county public works department has approved extensions which do not comply with design criteria, which exceed the capacity of waste treatment plants or the production capacity of public water supply systems, or which otherwise violate state or federal requirements.\n\n7. The department shall exempt any public water supply system from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement of an applicable national drinking water regulation if these regulations apply to contaminants which the department determines are harmless or beneficial to the health of consumers and if the owner of a public water supply system determines that funds are not reasonably available to provide for controlling amounts of those contaminants which are harmless or beneficial to the health of consumers.\n\n8.

The data quality for removal of water of the state from any list of impaired waters including any section 303(d) list shall be the same as the data quality for adding a water to that list.\n\nc. A water of the state shall not be placed on any section 303(d) list if the impairment is caused solely by violations of national pollutant discharge elimination system program permits or storm water permits issued pursuant to section 455B.103A and the enforcement of the pollution control measures is required.\n\nd. A water of the state shall not be placed on any section 303(d) list if the data shows an impairment, but existing technology-based effluent limits or other required pollution control measures are adequate to achieve applicable water quality standards.\n\ne. If a pollutant causing an impairment is unknown, the water of the state may be placed on a section 303(d) list.

The commission shall designate the official representative of this state on all comprehensive water resources planning groups for which state participation is provided. The commission shall coordinate state planning with local and national planning and, in safeguarding the interests of the state and its people, shall undertake the resolution of any conflicts that may arise between the water resources policies, plans, and projects of the federal government and the water resources policies, plans, and projects of the state, its agencies, and its people. This section does not limit or supplant the functions, duties, and responsibilities of other state or local agencies or institutions with regard to planning of water-associated projects within the particular area of responsibility of those state or local agencies or institutions.\n\n3. The commission shall enter into negotiations and agreements with the federal government relative to the operation of, or the release of water from, any project that has been authorized or constructed by the federal government when the commission deems the negotiations and agreements to be necessary for the achievement of the policies of this state relative to its water resources.\n\n4. The commission, on behalf of the state, shall enter into negotiations with the federal government relative to the inclusion of conservation storage features for water supply in any project that has been authorized by the federal government when the commission deems the negotiations to be necessary for the achievement of the policies of this state, however, an agreement reached pursuant to these negotiations does not bind the state until enacted into law by the general assembly.\n\n5. A water user who benefits from the development by the federal government of conservation storage for water supply shall be encouraged to assume the responsibility for repaying to the federal government any reimbursable costs incurred in the development, and a user who accepts benefits from the developments financed in whole or part by the state shall assume by contract the responsibility of repaying to the state the user’s reasonable share of the state’s obligations in accordance with a basis which will assure payment within the life of the development. An appropriation, diversion, or use shall not be made by a person of any waters of the state that have been stored or released from storage either under the authority of the state or pursuant to an agreement between the state and the federal government until the person has assumed by contract the person’s repayment responsibility. However, this subsection does not infringe upon any vested property interests.\n\n6. a. In its contracts with water users for the payment of state obligations incurred in the development of conservation storage for water supply, the commission shall include the terms deemed reasonable and necessary:\n\n(1) To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the state.\n\n(2) To achieve the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(3) To provide that the state is not responsible to any person if the waters involved are insufficient for performance.\n\nb. The commission may designate and describe any such contract, and describe the relationships to which it relates, as a sale of storage capacity, a sale of water release services, a contract for the storage or sale of water, or any similar terms suggestive of the creation of a property interest. The term of the contracts shall be commensurate with the investment and use concerned, but the commission shall not enter into any such contract for a term in excess of the maximum period provided for water use permits.\n\n7. The commission shall procure flood control works and water resources projects from or by cooperation with any agency of the United States, by cooperation with the cities and other subdivisions of the state under the laws of the state relating to flood control and use of water resources, and by cooperation with the action of landowners in areas affected by the works or projects when the commission deems the projects to be necessary for the achievement of the policies of this state.\n\n8. The commission shall promote the policies set forth in this part and shall represent this state in all matters within the scope of this part. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A as necessary to transact its business and for the administration and exercise of its powers and duties.\n\n9.

In its consideration of applications for permits, the department shall give priority in processing to persons in the order that the applications are received, except where the application of this processing priority system prevents the prompt approval of routine applications or where the public health, safety, or welfare will be threatened by delay. If the department determines after investigation that the diversion, storage, or withdrawal is consistent with the principles and policies of beneficial use and ensuring conservation, the department shall grant a permit. An application for a permit shall be approved or denied within ninety days from the date that the department receives the complete application. A renewal permit shall be approved or denied by the department within thirty days from the date that the department receives a complete application for renewal. If the applicant requests an extension of the time allotted, the department may approve the request to allow the applicant more time to submit additional information to resolve a contested or complex application. Regardless of the request in the application, and subject to appeal, the director or the department may determine the duration and frequency of withdrawal and the quantity of water to be diverted, stored, or withdrawn pursuant to the permit. Each permit granted after July 1, 1986, shall include conditions requiring routine conservation practices, and requiring implementation of emergency conservation measures after notification by the department.\n\n2. If an application is received by July 1, 1986, the department shall grant a permit for the continuation of a beneficial use of water that was a nonregulated use prior to July 1, 1985, and now requires a permit pursuant to section 455B.268. However, the permit is subject to conditions requiring routine and emergency conservation measures and to modification or cancellation under section 455B.271. Applications received after July 1, 1986 for those uses shall be determined pursuant to subsection 1.\n\n3. Permits shall be granted for a period of ten years; however, permits for withdrawal of water may be granted for less than ten years if geological data on the capacity of the aquifer and the rate of its recharge are indeterminate, and permits for the storage of water may be granted for the life of the structure unless revoked by the department. A permit granted shall remain as an appurtenance of the land described in the permit through the date specified in the permit and any extension of the permit or until an earlier date when the permit or its extension is canceled under section 455B.271. Upon application for a permit prior to the termination date specified in the permit, a permit may be renewed by the department for a period of ten years.\n\n4. Permits for aquifer storage and recovery shall be granted for a period of twenty years or the life of the project, whichever is less, unless revoked by the department.

At a minimum, the information shall include engineering, investigation, and evaluation information requisite to assure protection of the groundwater resource, and assurances that an aquifer storage and recovery site shall not unreasonably restrict other uses of the aquifer. Upon application and prior to the termination date specified in the original permit or a subsequent renewal permit, a renewal permit may be issued by the department for an additional period of twenty years. The department shall not authorize withdrawals of treated water from an aquifer storage and recovery site by anyone other than the permittee during the period of the original permit and each subsequent renewal permit. Treated water injected into an aquifer covered by a permit issued pursuant to this subsection is the property of the permittee.\n\n5.

The department may commence, maintain, and prosecute any appropriate action to enjoin or abate a nuisance, including any of the nuisances specified in subsection 1 and any other nuisance which adversely affects flood control.\n\n3. a. A person shall file a written application with the department if the person desires to do any of the following:\n\n(1) Erect, construct, use, or maintain a structure, dam, obstruction, deposit, or excavation in or on any floodway or floodplains.\n\n(2) Erect, construct, maintain, or operate a dam on a navigable or meandered stream.\n\n(3) Erect, construct, maintain, or operate a dam on a stream for manufacturing or industrial purposes.\n\nb. The application shall set forth information as required by rule of the commission. The department, after an investigation, shall approve or deny the application imposing conditions and terms as prescribed by the department.\n\n4. Notwithstanding design criteria and guidelines for Iowa dams adopted by the department, all of the following standards shall apply to a person reconstructing a dam that was damaged due to a natural disaster who files an application under subsection 3:\n\na. The person reconstructing the dam is only required to possess the flooding easements or ownership which was held prior to the reconstruction as long as the former normal pool elevation is not exceeded and the spillway capacity is increased by at least fifty percent.\n\nb. Flooding easements or ownership is only required to the top of the reconstructed spillway elevation.\n\n5. The department may maintain an action in equity to enjoin a person from erecting or making or permitting to be made a structure, dam, obstruction, deposit, or excavation for which a permit has not been granted. The department may also seek judicial abatement of any structure, dam, obstruction, deposit, or excavation erected or made without a permit required under this part. The abatement proceeding may be commenced to enforce an administrative determination of the department in a contested case proceeding that a public nuisance exists and should be abated. The costs of abatement shall be borne by the violator. Notwithstanding section 352.11, a structure, dam, obstruction, deposit, or excavation on a floodway or floodplain in an agricultural area established under chapter 352 is not exempt from the sections of this part which relate to regulation of floodplains and floodways.

The department shall record the prohibition in the office of the county recorder of the appropriate county and the prohibition shall attach to the land.\n\n9. The commission shall establish, by rule, thresholds for dimensions and effects, and any structure, dam, obstruction, deposit, or excavation having smaller dimensions and effects than those established by the commission is not subject to regulation under this section.

      "text": "455B.304 Rules established.\n\n1. The commission shall establish rules for the proper administration of this part 1 of subchapter IV which shall reflect and accommodate as far as is reasonably possible the current and generally accepted methods and techniques for treatment and disposition of solid waste which will serve the purposes of this part, and which shall take into consideration the factors, including others which it deems proper, such as existing physical conditions, topography, soils and geology, climate, transportation, and land use, and which shall include but are not limited to rules relating to the establishment and location of sanitary disposal projects, sanitary practices, inspection of sanitary disposal projects, collection of solid waste, disposal of solid waste, pollution controls, the issuance of permits, approved methods of private disposition of solid waste, the general operation and maintenance of sanitary disposal projects, and the implementation of this part.\n\n2. The commission shall adopt rules that allow the use of wet or dry sludge from publicly owned treatment works for land application. A sale of wet or dry sludge for the purpose of land application shall be accompanied by a written agreement signed by both parties which contains a general analysis of the contents of the sludge. The heavy metal content of the sludge shall not exceed that allowed by rules of the commission. An owner of a publicly owned treatment works which sells wet or dry sludge is not subject to any action by the purchaser to recover damages for harm to person or property caused by sludge that is delivered pursuant to a sale unless it is a result of a violation of the written agreement or if the heavy metal content of the sludge exceeds that allowed by rules of the commission. Nothing in this section shall provide immunity to any person from action by the department pursuant to section 455B.307.\n\n3. The commission shall adopt rules prohibiting the disposal of uncontained liquid waste in a sanitary landfill. The rules shall prohibit land burial or disposal by land application of wet sewer sludge at a sanitary landfill.\n\n4. The commission shall adopt rules requiring that each sanitary landfill established pursuant to section 455B.302 and permitted pursuant to section 455B.305 install and maintain a sufficient number of groundwater monitoring wells to adequately determine the quality of the groundwater and the impact the sanitary landfill, if any, is having on the groundwater adjacent to the sanitary landfill.\n\n5. The commission shall adopt rules requiring a schedule of monitoring of the quality of groundwater adjacent to a sanitary landfill from the groundwater monitoring wells installed in accordance with this section during the period the sanitary landfill is in use. Schedules of monitoring may be varied in consideration of the types of sanitary disposal practices, hydrologic and geologic conditions, construction and operation characteristics, and volumes and types of wastes handled at the sanitary landfill.\n\n6. The commission shall, by rule, require continued monitoring of groundwater pursuant to this section for a period of thirty years after the sanitary disposal project is closed. The commission may prescribe a lesser period of monitoring duration and frequency in consideration of the potential or lack thereof for groundwater contamination from a sanitary landfill. The commission may extend the thirty-year monitoring period on a site-specific basis by adopting rules specifically addressing additional monitoring requirements for each sanitary disposal project for which the monitoring period is to be extended.\n\n7. The commission shall adopt rules that may require the installation of shafts to relieve the accumulation of gas in a sanitary landfill.\n\n8. The commission shall adopt rules which establish closure, postclosure, leachate control and treatment, and financial assurance standards and requirements and which establish minimum levels of financial responsibility for sanitary disposal projects.\n\n9. The commission shall adopt rules which establish the minimum distance between tiling lines and a sanitary landfill in order to assure no adverse effect on the groundwater.\n\n10. The commission shall adopt rules for the distribution of grants to cities, counties, central planning agencies, and public or private agencies working in cooperation with cities or counties, for the purpose of solid waste management. The rules shall base the awarding of grants on a project’s reflection of the solid waste management policy and hierarchy established in section 455B.301A, the proposed amount of local matching funds, and community need.\n\n11. A sanitary landfill operating with a permit shall have a trained, tested, and certified operator. The department shall adopt by rule a certification program.\n\n12. The commission shall adopt rules for the certification of operators of solid waste incinerators. The criteria for certification shall include, but is not limited to, an operator’s technical competency and operation and maintenance of solid waste incinerators.\n\n13. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter regarding the requirement of the equipping of a sanitary landfill with a leachate control system and the establishment and continuation of a postclosure account, the department shall adopt rules that provide for an exemption from the requirements to equip a publicly owned sanitary landfill with a leachate control system and to establish and maintain a postclosure account if the sanitary landfill operator is a public agency, if the sanitary landfill closed by July 1, 1992, and no longer accepted waste for disposal after that date, and if at the time of closure of the sanitary landfill monitoring of the groundwater does not reveal the presence of leachate. The department shall require postclosure groundwater monitoring and shall establish the requirements for the implementation of leachate collection and control in cases in which leachate is found during postclosure monitoring. The department shall provide for a closure completion period following the date of closure of a sanitary landfill. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the public agency shall retain financial responsibility for closure and postclosure requirements applicable to sanitary disposal projects.\n\n14. The commission shall adopt rules providing for the land application of soils resulting from the remediation of petroleum releases and the land application of certain solid wastes including industrial sludges in the state.\n\n15. The commission shall adopt rules which require all sanitary disposal projects in which the tonnage fee pursuant to section 455B.310 is imposed, to install scales and utilize these scales to calculate payment of the tonnage fee.\n\n16. The commission shall adopt rules which prohibit the land application of petroleum contaminated soils on floodplains.\n\n17. The commission shall adopt rules to establish a special waste authorization program. For purposes of this subsection, “special waste” means any industrial process waste, pollution control waste, or toxic waste which presents a threat to human health or the environment or a waste with inherent properties which make the disposal of the waste in a sanitary landfill difficult to manage. Special waste does not include domestic, office, commercial, medical, or industrial waste that does not require special handling or limitations on its disposal. Special waste does not include hazardous wastes which are regulated under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §6921 – 6934, nor does it include hazardous waste as defined in section 455B.411, except to the extent that the commission has adopted rules allowing the disposal of certain wastes.\n\n18. The commission shall adopt rules for the issuance of a single general permit, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing. The single general permit shall cover numerous facilities to the extent that they are representative of a class of facilities which can be identified and conditioned by a single permit.\n\n19. The commission shall adopt rules for determining when the utilization of a solid by-product, including energy recovery, constitutes beneficial use rather than the disposal of solid waste. Materials approved for beneficial use at a sanitary landfill shall be exempt from the tonnage fee imposed by section 455B.310 to the extent authorized by rule or permit.\n\n[C71, §406.5; C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §455B.78; 82 Acts, ch 1112, §1, 2]\n\nC83, §455B.304\n\n85 Acts, ch 58, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1174, §1 – 3; 87 Acts, ch 225, §406 – 408; 89 Acts, ch 272, §29; 90 Acts, ch 1235, §16; 90 Acts, ch 1255, §27; 90 Acts, ch 1260, §25; 92 Acts, ch 1215, §5; 94 Acts, ch 1177, §2; 95 Acts, ch 61, §2; 95 Acts, ch 215, §3; 97 Acts, ch 137, §7; 98 Acts, ch 1193, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1014, §3; 2008 Acts, ch 1118, §2, 3; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §150; 2022 Acts, ch 1013, §3\n\nReferred to in §455B.172, 455B.301",

A city, county, or private agency operating, or planning to operate, a municipal solid waste sanitary disposal project shall file with the director one of two types of comprehensive plans detailing the method by which the city, county, or private agency will comply with this part 1. The first type is a comprehensive plan in which solid waste is disposed of in a sanitary landfill within the planning area. The second type is a comprehensive plan in which all solid waste is consolidated at, and transported from, a transfer station for disposal at a sanitary landfill in another comprehensive planning area or state.\n\na. All cities and counties shall also file with the director a comprehensive plan detailing the method by which the city or county will comply with the requirements of section 455B.302 to establish and implement a comprehensive solid waste reduction program for its residents.\n\nb. A public agency managing the waste stream for cities or counties pursuant to chapter 28E shall file one comprehensive plan on behalf of its members. Filing of a comprehensive plan constitutes full compliance by the public agency’s members with the filing requirements of this section.\n\nc. If both a public agency managing the waste stream for a city or county pursuant to chapter 28E, and one or more of the public agency’s member cities or counties file a comprehensive plan under this subsection, the director shall, following notice to the agency, make a determination that any plan filed by a member city or county is compatible with the comprehensive plan of the chapter 28E public agency. If the director determines that a city’s or county’s comprehensive plan is not compatible with the comprehensive plan of a public agency, as defined in chapter 28E, the director shall require the city or county to provide justification for the approval of the comprehensive plan based upon the following factors: the innovative nature of the comprehensive plan, the urgency of the plan’s implementation, any unique features of the city’s or county’s comprehensive plan, and whether the plan otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter.\n\nd. This subsection does not prevent the director from approving pilot projects which otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter.\n\ne. The director shall review each comprehensive plan submitted and may reject, suggest modification, or approve the proposed plan. The director shall aid in the development of comprehensive plans for compliance with this part. The director shall make available to cities, counties, and private agencies the forms appropriate for the submission of comprehensive plans, and the director may hold hearings for the purpose of implementing this part.\n\nf. The director, and any governmental agencies with primary responsibility for the development and conservation of energy resources, shall provide research and assistance when cities and counties operating, or planning to operate, sanitary disposal projects request aid in planning and implementing resource recovery systems.\n\ng. A comprehensive plan filed by a private agency operating, or planning to operate, a sanitary disposal project required by section 455B.302 shall be developed in cooperation and consultation with the city or county responsible for establishing and operating a sanitary disposal project.\n\nh. The director shall review a completed plan for the control and treatment of leachate, to meet the requirements of subsection 7, paragraph “b”, and shall reject the plan, suggest modifications, or approve it within six months of the time the plan was submitted. If the director has not acted on the plan within those six months, the plan shall be considered approved. However, the director, upon a request to renew or reissue a previously issued permit may require that the plan be updated.\n\n2. A planning area that closes all of the municipal solid waste sanitary landfills located in the planning area and chooses instead to use a municipal solid waste sanitary landfill in another planning area may choose to retain its autonomy as long as the sanitary landfill in the other planning area complies with all the requirements of this chapter, and all solid waste generated within the planning area closing its landfills is consolidated at, and transported from, a permitted transfer station. For purposes of this subsection, a planning area closing its own landfills that chooses to retain its autonomy shall not be required to join the planning area that contains the sanitary landfill it is using for final disposal of its solid waste.\n\na. If a planning area chooses to retain autonomy pursuant to this subsection, the planning area receiving solid waste from the planning area sending it shall not be required to include the sending planning area in its comprehensive plan provided that no services other than the acceptance of solid waste for disposal are shared between the two planning areas. A planning area receiving solid waste shall only be responsible for the permitting, planning, and waste reduction and diversion programs within that planning area.\n\nb. If the department determines that solid waste cannot reasonably be consolidated and transported from a particular transfer station, the department may establish permit conditions to address the transport and disposal of the solid waste. A planning area sending solid waste for disposal in another planning area may retain autonomy under this subsection only if both comprehensive planning areas enter into an agreement pursuant to chapter 28E that includes all of the following:\n\n(1) A detailed methodology of the manner in which solid waste will be tracked and reported between the two planning areas.\n\n(2) A detailed methodology of the manner in which the receiving sanitary landfill will collect, remit, and report tonnage fees, pursuant to section 455B.310, paid by the planning area that is transporting the solid waste. The methodology shall include both the remittances of tonnage fees to the state and the retained tonnage fees.\n\n3. The plan required by subsection 1 for sanitary disposal projects shall be filed with the department at the time of initial application for the construction and operation of a sanitary disposal project and at a minimum shall be updated and refiled with the department at the time of each subsequent application for renewal or reissuance of a previously issued permit. The department may, consistent with rules of the commission, require filing or updating of a plan at other times.\n\n4. A city or county required to file with the director a comprehensive plan detailing the method by which the city or county will comply with the requirements of section 455B.302 to establish and implement a comprehensive solid waste reduction program for its residents and which seeks approval of the inclusion of refuse-derived fuel as a component of its percentage of waste reduction, shall file an annual report with the director regarding the percentage of reduction attributable to refuse-derived fuel and the justification for such inclusion. The director shall approve or reject the inclusion. The percentage of reduction attributable to refuse-derived fuel and allowable for inclusion shall not exceed fifty percent.\n\n5. A comprehensive plan filed pursuant to this section shall incorporate and reflect the waste management hierarchy of the state solid waste management policy and shall at a minimum address the following general topics:\n\na. The extent to which solid waste is or can be recycled.\n\nb. The economic and technical feasibility of using other existing sanitary disposal project facilities in lieu of initiating or continuing the sanitary landfill currently used.\n\nc. The expected environmental impact of alternative solid waste disposal methods, including the use of sanitary landfills.\n\nd. A specific plan and schedule for implementing technically and economically feasible solid waste disposal methods that will result in minimal environmental impact.\n\n6. The comprehensive plan shall provide details of a local recycling program which shall contain a methodology for meeting the state volume reduction goal pursuant to section 455D.3, and a methodology for implementing a program of separation of wastes including but not limited to glass, plastic, paper, and metal.\n\n7. In addition to the above requirements, the following specific areas must be addressed in detail in a comprehensive plan filed in conjunction with the issuance, renewal, or reissuance of a permit for a sanitary disposal project:\n\na. A closure and postclosure plan detailing the schedule for and the methods by which the operator will meet the conditions for proper closure and postclosure adopted by rule by the commission. The plan shall include, but is not limited to, the proposed frequency and types of actions to be implemented prior to and following closure of an operation, the proposed postclosure actions to be taken to return the area to a condition suitable for other uses, and an estimate of the costs of closure and postclosure and the proposed method of meeting these costs. The postclosure plan shall reflect the entire applicable postclosure period.\n\nb. A plan for the control and treatment of leachate, including financial considerations proposed in meeting the costs of control and treatment in order to meet the requirements of section 455B.305, subsection 3.\n\nc. A financial plan detailing the actual cost of the sanitary disposal project and including the funding sources of the project. In addition to the submittal of the financial plan filed pursuant to this subsection, the operator of an existing sanitary landfill shall submit an annual financial statement to the department.\n\nd. An emergency response and remedial action plan including established provisions to minimize the possibility of fire, explosion, or any release to air, land, or water of pollutants that could threaten human health and the environment, and the identification of possible occurrences that may endanger human health and environment.\n\ne. A description of the planning area and service area to be served by the city, county, or private agency under the comprehensive plan. Except as provided in subsection 2, a comprehensive plan shall not include a planning area or service area, any part of which is included in another comprehensive plan.\n\n8. When a proposed plan is subject to review and approval by several state and local agencies, if the plan is substantially modified after approval by an agency, the plan shall be resubmitted as a new proposal to all other agencies to ensure that all agencies have approved the same plan.\n\n9. In addition to the comprehensive plan filed pursuant to subsection 1, a person operating, or proposing to operate, a sanitary disposal project shall provide a financial assurance instrument to the department prior to the initial approval of a permit or prior to the renewal of a permit for an existing or expanding facility.\n\na. The financial assurance instrument shall meet all requirements adopted by rule by the commission, and shall not be canceled, revoked, disbursed, released, or allowed to terminate without the approval of the department. Following the cessation of operation or the closure of a sanitary disposal project, neither the guarantor nor the operator shall cancel, revoke, or disburse the financial assurance instrument or allow the instrument to terminate until the operator is released from closure, postclosure, and monitoring responsibilities.\n\nb. The operator of a sanitary landfill shall maintain closure and postclosure accounts, which may be combined into one account. The commission shall adopt by rule the amounts to be contributed to the accounts based upon the amount of solid waste received by the facility. The accounts established shall be specific to the facility.\n\n(1) Money in the accounts shall not be assigned for the benefit of creditors with the exception of the state.\n\n(2) Money in an account shall not be used to pay any final judgment against a licensee arising out of the ownership or operation of the site during its active life or after closure.\n\n(3) Conditions under which the department may gain access to the accounts and circumstances under which the accounts may be released to the operator after closure and postclosure responsibilities have been met, shall be established by the commission.\n\nc. The commission shall adopt by rule the minimum amounts of financial responsibility for sanitary disposal projects.\n\nd.

The term “primarily to protect that person’s security interest” includes but is not limited to ownership interests acquired as a consequence of that person exercising rights as a security interest holder in the hazardous condition site, where the exercise is necessary or appropriate to protect the security interest, to preserve the value of the collateral, or to recover a loan or indebtedness secured by the interest. The person holding indicia of ownership in a hazardous condition site and who acquires title or a right to title to the site upon default under the security arrangement, or at, or in lieu of, foreclosure, shall continue to hold the indicia of ownership primarily to protect that person’s security interest so long as the subsequent actions of the person with respect to the site are intended to protect the collateral secured by the interest, and demonstrate that the person is seeking to sell or liquidate the secured property rather than holding the property for investment purposes.\n\n(2) Does not exhibit managerial control of, or managerial responsibility for, the daily operation of the hazardous condition site through the actual, direct, and continual or recurrent exercise of managerial control over the hazardous condition site in which that person holds a security interest, which managerial control materially divests the borrower, debtor, or obligor of control.\n\n(3) Has taken no subsequent action with respect to the site which causes or exacerbates a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance.\n\n8. “Political subdivision” means any municipality, township, or county, or district, or authority, or any portion, or combination of two or more thereof, including but not limited to any emergency services and emergency management agency established pursuant to chapter 28E or 29C, and any municipal fire departments and ambulance services and agents thereof.\n\n9. “Release” means a threatened or real emission, discharge, spillage, leakage, pumping, pouring, emptying, or dumping of a hazardous substance into or onto the land, air, or waters of the state unless one of the following applies:\n\na.

A person having control over a hazardous substance is strictly liable to the state or a political subdivision for all of the following:\n\n(1) The reasonable cleanup costs incurred by the state or its political subdivisions or the agents of the state or a political subdivision as a result of the failure of the person to clean up a hazardous substance involved in a hazardous condition caused by that person.\n\n(2) The reasonable costs incurred by the state or its political subdivisions or the agents of the state or a political subdivision to evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the person.\n\n(3) The reasonable damages to the state for the injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a hazardous condition caused by that person including the costs of assessing the injury, destruction, or loss.\n\n(4) The excessive and extraordinary cost incurred by the state or its political subdivisions or the agents of the state or a political subdivision in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused by that person.\n\nb. If the failure is willful, the person is liable for punitive damages not to exceed triple the cleanup costs incurred by the state or its political subdivisions or the agents of the state or a political subdivision. Prompt and good faith notification to the state or a political subdivision by the person having control over a hazardous substance that the person does not have the resources or managerial capability to begin or continue cleanup, or a good faith effort to clean up, relieves the person of liability for punitive damages, but not for actual cleanup costs.\n\nc. Claims under this subsection shall be made by the state agency or the political subdivision that incurred costs or damages under this subsection, and such costs or damages will be subject to administrative and judicial review, including the terms of chapter 17A when appropriate. If administrative or judicial review is sought, a political subdivision making a claim shall submit an advisory request to the department to determine whether the cleanup actions serving as the basis for the cleanup costs were consistent with this chapter. The department shall respond in writing to a request within thirty days of receiving the request.\n\n2. Liability under subsection 1 is limited to the following maximum dollar limitations:\n\na. Five million dollars for any vehicle, boat, aircraft, pipeline, or other manner of conveyance which transports a hazardous substance.\n\nb. Fifty million dollars for any facility generating, storing, or disposing of a hazardous substance.\n\n3. There is no liability under this section for a person otherwise liable if the hazardous condition is solely resulting from one or more of the following:\n\na. An act of God.\n\nb. An act of war.\n\nc. (1) An act or omission of a third party if the person establishes both of the following:\n\n(a) That taking into consideration the characteristics of the hazardous substance, the person otherwise liable exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance.\n\n(b) That the person otherwise liable took precautions against the foreseeable acts or omissions of the third party and the foreseeable consequences.\n\n(2) As used in this paragraph, “third party” does not include an employee or agent of the person otherwise liable or a third party whose act or omission occurs directly or indirectly in connection with a contractual relationship with the person otherwise liable.\n\n4. There is no liability under this section for a person otherwise liable if all of the following conditions exist:\n\na. The liability arises during the transportation of a hazardous substance.\n\nb. The fact that the hazardous substance is a hazardous substance has been misrepresented to the person transporting the hazardous substance.\n\nc. The person transporting the hazardous substance does not know or have reason to know that the misrepresentation has been made.\n\n5. Money collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the hazardous waste remedial fund created in section 455B.423. Moneys shall be used in the manner permitted for the fund. Moneys collected by a state agency other than the department of natural resources pursuant to this section are appropriated to that agency for purposes of reimbursing costs of the agency for emergency response activities described in subsection 1. Moneys collected by a political subdivision pursuant to this section shall be retained by the political subdivision and shall be used for purposes of reimbursing costs of the political subdivision for emergency response activities described in subsection 1.\n\n6. This section does not deny any person any legal or equitable rights, remedies, or defenses or affect any legal relationship other than the legal relationship between the state or a political subdivision and a person having control over a hazardous substance pursuant to subsection 1.\n\n7. a. There is no liability under this section for a person who has satisfied the requirements of section 455B.381, subsection 7, paragraph “b”, regardless of when that person acquired title or right to title to the hazardous condition site, except that a person otherwise exempt from liability under this subsection shall be liable to the state or a political subdivision for the lesser of:\n\n(1) The total reasonable cleanup costs incurred by the state to clean up a hazardous substance at the hazardous condition site; or\n\n(2) The amount representing the postcleanup fair market value of the property comprising the hazardous condition site.\n\nb. Liability under this subsection shall only be imposed when the person holds title to the hazardous condition site at the time the state or a political subdivision incurs reasonable cleanup costs.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection, “postcleanup fair market value” means the actual amount of consideration received by such person upon sale or transfer of the hazardous condition site which has been cleaned up by the state or a political subdivision to a bona fide purchaser for value.\n\nd. Cleanup expenses incurred by the state or a political subdivision shall be a lien upon the real estate constituting the hazardous condition site, recordable and collectible in the same manner as provided for in section 424.11, Code 2016, subject to the terms of this subsection. The lien shall attach at the time the state or a political subdivision incurs expenses to clean up the hazardous condition site. The lien shall be valid as against subsequent mortgagees, purchasers, or judgment creditors, for value and without notice of the lien, only when a notice of the lien is filed with the recorder of the county in which the property is located. Upon payment by the person to the state or a political subdivision, of the amount specified in this subsection, the state or a political subdivision shall release the lien. If no lien has been recorded at the time the person sells or transfers the property, then the person shall not be liable for any cleanup costs incurred by the state or a political subdivision.\n\n84 Acts, ch 1108, §4; 86 Acts, ch 1158, §2, 3; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §1899; 93 Acts, ch 42, §3; 94 Acts, ch 1157, §1, 2; 2009 Acts, ch 16, §3; 2016 Acts, ch 1105, §4, 15\n\nReferred to in §455B.391, 459.506, 481A.151",

Release detection, prevention, and correction as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment, applicable to all owners and operators of underground storage tanks. The rules shall include but are not limited to requirements for:\n\n(1) Maintaining a leak detection system, an inventory control system with a tank testing, or a comparable system or method designed to identify releases in a manner consistent with the protection of human health and the environment.\n\n(2) Maintaining records of any monitoring or leak detection system, inventory control system, tank testing or comparable system, and periodic underground storage tank facility compliance inspections conducted by inspectors certified by the department.\n\n(3) Reporting of any releases and corrective action taken in response to a release from an underground storage tank.\n\n(4) Establishing criteria for classifying sites according to the release of a regulated substance in connection with an underground storage tank.\n\n(a) The classification system shall consider the actual or potential threat to public health and safety and to the environment posed by the contaminated site and shall take into account relevant factors, including the presence of contamination in soils, groundwaters, and surface waters, and the effect of conduits, barriers, and distances on the contamination found in those areas according to the following factors:\n\n(i) Soils shall be evaluated based upon the depth of the existing contamination and its distance from the ground surface to the contamination zone and the contamination zone to the groundwater; the soil type and permeability, including whether the contamination exists in clay, till or sand and gravel; and the variability of the soils, whether the contamination exists in soils of natural variability or in a disturbed area.\n\n(ii) Groundwaters shall be evaluated based upon the depth of the contamination and its distance from the ground surface to the groundwater and from the contamination zone to the groundwater; the flow pattern of the groundwater, the direction of the flow in relation to the contamination zone and the interconnection of the groundwater with the surface or with surface water and with other groundwater sources; the nature of the groundwater, whether it is located in a high yield aquifer, an isolated, low yield aquifer, or in a transient saturation zone; and use of the groundwater, whether it is used as a drinking water source for public or private drinking water supplies, for livestock watering, or for commercial and industrial processing.\n\n(iii) Surface water shall be evaluated based upon its location, its distance in relation to the contamination zone, the groundwater system and flow, and its location in relation to surface drainage.\n\n(iv) The effect of conduits, barriers, and distances on the contamination found in soils, groundwaters, and surface waters. Consideration should be given to the following: the effect of contamination on conduits such as wells, utility lines, tile lines and drainage systems; the effect of conduits on the transport of the contamination; whether a well is active or abandoned; what function the utility line serves, whether it is a sewer line, a water distribution line, telephone line, or other line; the existence of barriers such as buildings and other structures, pavement, and natural barriers, including rock formations and ravines; and the distance which separates the contamination found in the soils, groundwaters, or surface waters from the conduits and barriers.\n\n(b) A site shall be classified as either high risk, low risk, or no action required, as determined by a certified groundwater professional.\n\n(i) A site shall be considered high risk when a certified groundwater professional determines that contamination from the site presents an unreasonable risk to public health and safety or the environment under any of the following conditions:\n\n(A) Contamination is affecting or likely to affect groundwater which is used as a source water for public or private water supplies, to a level rendering them unsafe for human consumption.\n\n(B) Contamination is actually affecting or is likely to affect surface water bodies to a level where surface water quality standards, under section 455B.173, will be exceeded.\n\n(C) Harmful or explosive concentrations of petroleum substances or vapors affecting structures or utility installations exist or are likely to occur.\n\n(ii) A site shall be considered low risk when a certified groundwater professional determines that low risk conditions exist as follows:\n\n(A) Contamination is present and is affecting groundwater, but high risk conditions do not exist and are not likely to occur.\n\n(B) Contamination is above action level standards, but high risk conditions do not exist and are not likely to occur.\n\n(iii) A site shall be considered no action required and a no further action certificate shall be issued by the department when a certified groundwater professional determines that contamination is below action level standards and high or low risk conditions do not exist and are not likely to occur.\n\n(iv) For purposes of classifying a site as either low risk or no action required, the department shall rely upon the example tier one risk-based screening level look-up table of ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international’s emergency standard, ES38-94, or other look-up table as determined by the department by rule.\n\n(v) A site cleanup report which classifies a site as either high risk, low risk, or no action required shall be submitted by a groundwater professional to the department with a certification that the report complies with the provisions of this chapter and rules adopted by the department. The report shall be determinative of the appropriate classification of the site and the site shall be classified as indicated by the groundwater professional unless, within ninety days of receipt by the department, the department identifies material information in the report that is inaccurate or incomplete, and based upon inaccurate or incomplete information in the report the risk classification of the site cannot be reasonably determined by the department based upon industry standards. If the department determines that the site cleanup report is inaccurate or incomplete, the department shall notify the groundwater professional of the inaccurate or incomplete information within ninety days of receipt of the report and shall work with the groundwater professional to obtain correct information or additional information necessary to appropriately classify the site. However, from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, the department shall have one hundred twenty days to notify the certified groundwater professional when a report is not accepted based on material information that is found to be inaccurate or incomplete. A groundwater professional who knowingly or intentionally makes a false statement or misrepresentation which results in a mistaken classification of a site shall be guilty of a serious misdemeanor and shall have the groundwater professional’s certification revoked under this section.\n\n(5) The closure of tanks to prevent any future release of a regulated substance into the environment. If consistent with federal environmental protection agency technical standard regulations, state tank closure rules shall include, at the tank owner’s election, an option to fill the tank with an inert material. Removal of a tank shall not be required if the tank is filled with an inert material pursuant to department of natural resources rules. A tank closed, or to be closed and which is actually closed, within one year of May 13, 1988, shall be required to complete monitoring or testing as required by the department to ensure that the tank did not leak prior to closure, but shall not be required to have a monitoring system installed.\n\n(6) Establishing corrective action response requirements for the release of a regulated substance in connection with an underground storage tank. The corrective action response requirements shall include but not be limited to all of the following:\n\n(a) A requirement that the site cleanup report do all of the following:\n\n(i) Identify the nature and level of contamination resulting from the release.\n\n(ii) Provide supporting data and a recommendation of the degree of risk posed by the site relative to the site classification system adopted pursuant to paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4).\n\n(iii) Provide supporting data and a recommendation of the need for corrective action.\n\n(iv) Identify the corrective action options which shall address the practical feasibility of implementation, costs, expected length of time to implement, and environmental benefits.\n\n(b) To the fullest extent practicable, allow for the use of generally available hydrological, geological, topographical, and geographical information and minimize site specific testing in preparation of the site cleanup report.\n\n(c) Require that at a minimum the source of a release be stopped either by repairing, upgrading, or closing the tank and that free product be removed or contained on site.\n\n(d) High risk sites shall be addressed pursuant to a corrective action design report, as submitted by a groundwater professional and as accepted by the department. The corrective action design report shall determine the most appropriate response to the high risk conditions presented. The appropriate corrective action response shall be based upon industry standards and shall take into account the following:\n\n(i) The extent of remediation required to reclassify the site as a low risk site.\n\n(ii) The most appropriate exposure scenarios based upon residential, commercial, or industrial use or other predefined industry accepted scenarios.\n\n(iii) Exposure pathway characterizations including contaminant sources, transport mechanisms, and exposure pathways.\n\n(iv) Affected human or environmental receptors and exposure scenarios based on current and projected use scenarios.\n\n(v) Risk-based corrective action assessment principles which identify the risks presented to the public health and safety or the environment by each release in a manner that will protect the public health and safety or the environment using a tiered procedure consistent with ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international’s emergency standard, ES38-94.\n\n(vi) Other relevant site specific factors such as the feasibility of available technologies, existing background contaminant levels, current and planned future uses, ecological, aesthetic, and other relevant criteria, and the applicability and availability of engineering and institutional controls, including an environmental covenant as established by chapter 455I.\n\n(vii) Remediation shall not be required on a site that does not present an increased cancer risk at the point of exposure of one in one million for residential areas or one in ten thousand for nonresidential areas.\n\n(e) A corrective action design report submitted by a groundwater professional shall be accepted by the department and shall be primarily relied upon by the department to determine the corrective action response requirements of the site. However, if within ninety days of receipt of a corrective action design report, the department identifies material information in the corrective action design report that is inaccurate or incomplete, and if based upon information in the report the appropriate corrective action response cannot be reasonably determined by the department based upon industry standards, the department shall notify the groundwater professional that the corrective action design report is not accepted, and the department shall work with the groundwater professional to correct the material information or to obtain the additional information necessary to appropriately determine the corrective action response requirements as soon as practicable. However, from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, the department shall have one hundred twenty days to notify the certified groundwater professional when a corrective action design report is not accepted based on material information that is found to be inaccurate or incomplete. A groundwater professional who knowingly or intentionally makes a false statement or misrepresentation which results in an improper or incorrect corrective action response shall be guilty of a serious misdemeanor and shall have the groundwater professional’s certification revoked under this section.\n\n(f) Low risk sites shall be monitored as deemed necessary by the department consistent with industry standards. Monitoring shall not be required on a site which has received a no further action certificate. A site that has maintained less than the applicable target level for four consecutive sampling events shall be reclassified as a no action required site regardless of exit monitoring criteria and guidance.\n\n(g) An owner or operator may elect to proceed with additional corrective action on the site. However, any action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner or operator and shall not be considered corrective action for purposes of section 455G.9, unless otherwise previously agreed to by the board and the owner or operator pursuant to section 455G.9, subsection 7. Corrective action taken by an owner or operator due to the department’s failure to meet the time requirements provided in subparagraph division (e) shall be considered corrective action for purposes of section 455G.9.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding other provisions to the contrary and to the extent permitted by federal law, the department shall allow for bioremediation of soils and groundwater. For purposes of this subparagraph division, “bioremediation” means the use of biological organisms, including microorganisms or plants, to degrade organic pollutants to common natural products.\n\n(i) Replacement or upgrade of a tank on a site classified as a high or low risk site shall be equipped with a secondary containment system with monitoring of the space between the primary and secondary containment structures or other board approved tank system or methodology.\n\n(j) The commission and the board shall cooperate to ensure that remedial measures required by the corrective action rules adopted pursuant to this subparagraph (6) are reasonably cost-effective and shall, to the fullest extent possible, avoid duplicating and conflicting requirements.\n\n(k) The director may order an owner or operator to immediately take all corrective actions deemed reasonable and necessary by the director if the corrective action is consistent with the prioritization rules adopted under this subparagraph (6). Any order taken by the director pursuant to this subparagraph division shall be reviewed at the next meeting of the environmental protection commission.\n\n(7) Specifying an adequate monitoring system to detect the presence of a leaking underground storage tank and to provide for protection of the groundwater resources for regulated tanks installed prior to January 14, 1987. The effective date of the rules adopted shall be January 14, 1989. In the event that federal regulations are adopted by the United States environmental protection agency after the commission has adopted state standards pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall immediately proceed to adopt rules consistent with those federal regulations adopted. Unless the federal environmental protection agency adopts final rules to the contrary, rules adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to hydraulic lift reservoirs, such as for automobile hoists and elevators, containing hydraulic oil.\n\n(8) Issuing a no further action certificate or a monitoring certificate to the owner or operator of an underground storage tank site.\n\n(a) A no further action certificate shall be issued by the department for a site which has been classified as a no further action site or which has been reclassified pursuant to completion of a corrective action plan or monitoring plan to be a no further action site by a groundwater professional, unless within ninety days of receipt of the report submitted by the groundwater professional classifying the site, the department notifies the groundwater professional that the report and site classification are not accepted and the department identifies material information in the report that is inaccurate or incomplete which causes the department to be unable to accept the classification of the site. An owner or operator shall not be responsible for additional assessment, monitoring, or corrective action activities at a site that is issued a no further action certificate unless it is determined that the certificate was issued based upon false material statements that were knowingly or intentionally made by a groundwater professional and the false material statements resulted in the incorrect classification of the site.\n\n(b) A monitoring certificate shall be issued by the department for a site which does not require remediation, but does require monitoring of the site.\n\n(c) A certificate shall be recorded with the county recorder. The owner or operator of a site who has been issued a certificate under this subparagraph (8), or a subsequent purchaser of the site shall not be required to perform further corrective action because action standards are changed at a later date. A certificate shall not prevent the department from ordering corrective action of a new release.\n\n(9) Establishing a certified compliance inspector program administered by the department for underground storage tank facility compliance inspections.\n\n(a) The certified compliance inspector program shall provide for, but not be limited to, all of the following:\n\n(i) Mandatory periodic underground storage tank facility compliance inspections by owners and operators using inspectors certified by the department.\n\n(ii) Compliance inspector qualifications, certification procedures, certification and renewal fees sufficient to cover administrative costs, continuing education requirements, inspector discipline standards including certification suspension and revocation for good cause, compliance inspection standards, professional liability bonding or insurance requirements, and any other requirements as the commission may deem appropriate. Certification and renewal fees received by the department are appropriated to the department for purposes of the administration of the certified compliance inspector program.\n\n(b) The department shall continue to conduct independent inspections as provided in section 455B.475 as deemed appropriate to assure effective compliance and enforcement and for the purpose of auditing the accuracy and completeness of inspections conducted by certified compliance inspectors.\n\n(c) Acts or omissions by a certified compliance inspector, the state, or the department regarding certification, renewal, oversight of the certification process, continuing education, discipline, inspection standards, or any other actions, rules, or regulations arising out of the certification, inspections, or duties imposed by this section shall not be cause for a claim against the state or the department within the meaning of chapter 669 or any other provision of the Iowa Code.\n\nb. In adopting the rules under this subsection, the commission may distinguish between types, classes, and ages of underground storage tanks. In making the distinctions, the commission may take into consideration factors including but not limited to location of the tanks, compatibility of a tank material with the soil and climate conditions, uses of the tanks, history of maintenance, age of the tanks, current industry recommended practices, national consensus codes, hydrogeology, water table, size of the tanks, quantity of regulated substances periodically deposited in or dispensed from the tank, the degree of risk presented by the regulated substance, the technical and managerial capability of the owners and operators, and the compatibility of the regulated substance and the materials of which the underground storage tank is fabricated.\n\nc. The department may issue a variance, which includes an enforceable compliance schedule, from the mandatory monitoring requirement for an owner or operator who demonstrates plans for tank removal, replacement, or filling with an inert material pursuant to a department approved variance. A variance may be renewed for just cause.\n\n2. The maintenance of evidence of financial responsibility as the director determines to be feasible and necessary for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by release of a regulated substance from an underground storage tank.\n\na. (1) (a) Financial responsibility required by this subsection may be established in accordance with rules adopted by the commission by any one, or any combination, of the following methods:\n\n(i) Insurance.\n\n(ii) Guarantee.\n\n(iii) Surety bond.\n\n(iv) Letter of credit.\n\n(v) Qualification as a self-insurer.\n\n(b) In adopting requirements under this subsection, the commission may specify policy or other contractual terms, conditions, or defenses which are necessary or are unacceptable in establishing the evidence of financial responsibility.\n\n(2) A person who establishes financial responsibility by self-insurance shall not require or shall not enforce an indemnification agreement with an operator or owner of the tank covered by the self-insurance obligation, unless the owner or operator has committed a substantial breach of a contract between the self-insurer and the owner or operator, and that substantial breach relates directly to the operation of the tank in an environmentally sound manner. This subparagraph applies to all contracts between a self-insurer and an owner or operator entered into on or after May 5, 1989.\n\nb. If the owner or operator is in bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangement pursuant to the federal bankruptcy law or if jurisdiction in any state court or federal court cannot be obtained over an owner or operator likely to be solvent at the time of judgment, any claim arising from conduct for which evidence of financial responsibility must be provided under this subsection may be asserted directly against the guarantor providing the evidence of financial responsibility. In the case of action pursuant to this paragraph, the guarantor is entitled to invoke all rights and defenses which would have been available to the owner or operator if an action had been brought against the owner or operator by the claimant and which would have been available to the guarantor if an action had been brought against the guarantor by the owner or operator.\n\nc. The total liability of a guarantor shall be limited to the aggregate amount which the guarantor has provided as evidence of financial responsibility to the owner or operator under this subsection. This subsection does not limit any other state or federal statutory, contractual, or common law liability of a guarantor to its owner or operator including, but not limited to, the liability of the guarantor for bad faith in negotiating or in failing to negotiate the settlement of any claim. This subsection does not diminish the liability of any person under section 107 or 111 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or other applicable law.\n\nd. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “guarantor” means any person, other than the owner or operator, who provides evidence of financial responsibility for an owner or operator under this subsection.\n\ne. If an owner or operator is required to uncover or remove an underground storage tank based upon a determination of the department that the underground storage tank presents a hazard to the public health, safety, or the environment, and if upon inspection of the tank the determination is unfounded, the state may reimburse reasonable costs incurred in the inspection of the tank. Claims for reimbursement shall be filed on forms provided by the commission. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A relating to determinations of reasonableness in approval or rejection of claims in cases of dispute. Claims shall be paid from the general fund of the state. When any one of the tanks or the related pumps and piping at a multiple tank facility are found to be leaking, the state shall not reimburse costs for uncovering or removing any of the other tanks, piping, or pumps that are not found to be leaking.\n\n3. Standards of performance for new underground storage tanks which shall include but are not limited to design, construction, installation, release detection, and compatibility standards. Until the effective date of the standards adopted by the commission and after January 1, 1986, a person shall not install an underground storage tank for the purpose of storing regulated substances unless the tank, whether of single or double wall construction, meets all the following conditions:\n\na. The tank will prevent release due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank.\n\nb. The tank is cathodically protected against corrosion, constructed of noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or designed in a manner to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance.\n\nc. The material used in the construction or lining of the tank is compatible with the substance to be stored. If soil tests conducted in accordance with ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international’s standard G57-78 or another standard approved by the commission show that soil resistivity in an installation location is twelve thousand ohm/cm or more, unless a more stringent soil resistivity standard is adopted by rule of the commission, a storage tank without corrosion protection may be installed in that location until the effective date of the standards adopted by the commission and after January 1, 1986.\n\nd. Rules adopted by the commission shall specify adequate monitoring systems to detect the presence of a leaking underground storage tank and to provide for protection of the groundwater resources from regulated tanks installed after January 14, 1987. In the event that federal regulations are adopted by the United States environmental protection agency after the commission has adopted state standards pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall immediately proceed to adopt rules consistent with those federal regulations adopted. Tanks installed on or after January 14, 1987, shall continue to be considered new tanks for purposes of this chapter and are subject to state monitoring requirements unless federal requirements are more restrictive.\n\n4. The form and content of the written notices required by section 455B.473.\n\n5. The duties of owners or operators of underground storage tanks to locate and abate the source of release of regulated substances, when in the judgment of the director, the local hydrology, geology and other relevant factors reasonably include a tank as a potential source.\n\n6. Reporting requirements necessary to enable the department to maintain an accurate inventory of underground storage tanks.\n\n7. Designation of regulated substances subject to this part, consistent with section 455B.471, subsection 8.
