Most Iowans desire to have improved water quality throughout the state, but many Iowans do not understand the problems with local water quality.\n\nb. Most Iowans believe that the protection of fish and wildlife benefits all Iowans.\n\nc. The benefits of improving water quality could far outweigh the costs of implementing mechanisms to improve it.\n\nd. Most Iowans look to some level of government for the protection of water resources rather than to themselves and their own actions. However, it is not possible or desirable for state government to take complete control and responsibility for water quality.\n\ne. In addition to the use of Iowa land for agriculture and economic development, the land in watersheds and floodplains should be managed to reduce flooding, reduce flood damage, ameliorate the effects of drought, improve water quality, improve habitat and the natural environment, increase renewable energy production, and enhance recreational opportunities.\n\n2. Marketing campaign. The water resources coordinating council shall develop a marketing campaign to educate Iowans about the need to take personal responsibility for the quality and quantity of water in their local watersheds. The emphasis of the campaign shall be that not only is everyone responsible for clean water, but that everyone benefits from it as well, and that everyone is responsible for and benefits from reducing the risk for flooding and mitigating possible future flood damage. The goals of the campaign shall be to convince Iowans to take personal responsibility for clean water and reducing the risk of flooding and to equip them with the tools necessary to effect change through local water quality improvement projects and better floodplain management and flood risk programs.\n\n3. Contingent on funding. The duties imposed in subsection 2 are contingent upon the receipt of funding sufficient to cover the costs associated with the marketing campaign.\n\n2008 Acts, ch 1034, §4; 2009 Acts, ch 146, §13; 2010 Acts, ch 1193, §127",
