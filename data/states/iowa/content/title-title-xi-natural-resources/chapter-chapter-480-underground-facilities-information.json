A statewide notification center is established and shall be organized as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to chapter 504.\n\n(1) The center shall be governed by a board of directors which shall represent and be elected by operators, excavators, and other persons who participate in the center. The board, with input from all interested parties, shall determine the operating procedures and technology needed for a single statewide notification center and establish a notification process.\n\n(2) In addition, the board shall either establish a competitive bidding procedure to select a vendor to provide the notification service or retain sufficient and necessary staff to provide the notification service.\n\n(a) If a vendor is selected, the vendor contract shall be for a three-year period, which may be extended upon the approval of the board for a period not exceeding an additional three years. The terms of the vendor contract may be modified from time to time by the board and the vendor. The contract shall be reviewed, with an opportunity to receive new bids, at the end of the term of the contract.\n\n(b) If the board retains staff to provide the notification service, the board, at the board’s discretion, may review the notification service at any time and make a determination to use the competitive bidding procedure to select a vendor.\n\nb. Upon the selection of a vendor pursuant to paragraph “a”, the board shall notify the chairperson of the utilities board in writing of the selection. The board shall submit an annual report to the chairperson of the utilities board including an annual audit and review of the services provided by the notification center and the vendor.\n\nc. The board is subject to chapters 21 and 22.\n\n2. The board shall implement the latest and most cost-effective technological improvements for the center in order to provide operators and excavators with the most accurate data available and in a timely manner to allow operators and excavators to perform their responsibilities with the minimum amount of interruptions.\n\n3. Every operator shall participate in and share in the costs of the notification center. The financial condition and the transactions of the notification center shall be audited at least once each year by a certified public accountant.

      "text": "480.4 Required notice — location and marking of underground facilities — exception.\n\n1. a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to any excavation, an excavator shall contact the notification center and provide notice of the planned excavation. This notice must be given at least forty-eight hours prior to the commencement of the excavation, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Notices received after 5:00 p.m. shall be processed as if received at 8:00 a.m. the next business day. The notice shall be valid for twenty calendar days from the date the notice was provided to the notification center. If all locating and marking of underground facilities is completed prior to the expiration of the forty-eight-hour period, the excavator may proceed with excavation upon being notified by the notification center that the locating and marking of all underground facilities is complete. The notification center shall establish a toll-free telephone number to allow excavators to provide the notice required pursuant to this subsection.\n\nb. A notice provided pursuant to this subsection for a location within a city shall include the following information:\n\n(1) A street address or block and lot numbers, or both, of the proposed area of excavation.\n\n(2) The name and address of the excavator.\n\n(3) The excavator’s telephone number.\n\n(4) The type and extent of the proposed excavation.\n\n(5) Whether the discharge of explosives is anticipated.\n\n(6) The date and time when excavation is scheduled to begin.\n\n(7) Approximate location of the excavation on the property.\n\n(8) If known, the name of the housing development and property owner.\n\nc. A notice provided pursuant to this subsection for a location outside a city shall include the following information:\n\n(1) The name of the county, township, range, and section.\n\n(2) The name and address of the excavator.\n\n(3) The excavator’s telephone number.\n\n(4) The type and extent of the proposed excavation.\n\n(5) Whether the discharge of explosives is anticipated.\n\n(6) The date and time when excavation is scheduled to begin.\n\n(7) Approximate location of the excavation on the property.\n\n(8) If known, the quarter section, 911 address and global positioning system coordinate, name of property owner, name of housing development with street address or block and lot numbers, or both.\n\nd. For purposes of the requirements of this section, an excavation commences the first time excavation occurs in an area that was not previously identified by the excavator in an excavation notice.\n\ne. At the time of giving notice to the notification center pursuant to this subsection, an excavator shall use white paint, white flags, white stakes, or a combination thereof, to mark the proposed area of excavation, unless one of the following applies:\n\n(1) The precise location, direction, size, and length of the proposed excavation area can be clearly and adequately defined and described during the call to the notification center or during an onsite preconstruction meeting.\n\n(2) Electronic means of white-lining is supported by the notification center and used by the excavator.\n\n(3) Physical premarking can be shown to be impractical.\n\n2. The notification center, upon receiving notice from an excavator, shall immediately transmit the information contained in the notice to each operator in the area of the proposed excavation and provide the names of all operators in that area to the excavator. The notification center shall assign an inquiry identification number to each notice and shall maintain a record of each notice for at least six years from the date the notice is received. The notification center shall not assess an operator who requests in writing not to receive a notification of its own excavations for any portion of the costs associated with such excavations.\n\n3. a. (1) An operator who receives notice from the notification center shall mark the horizontal location of the operator’s underground facility and the excavator shall use due care in excavating in the marked area to avoid damaging the underground facility. The operator shall complete such locating and marking, and shall notify the notification center that the marking is complete within forty-eight hours after receiving the notice, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless otherwise agreed by the operator and the excavator. No later than the expiration of the forty-eight-hour period, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, the notification center shall notify the excavator of the underground facility locating and marking status, or the failure of the operator to notify the center that the locating and marking is complete. The locating and marking of the underground facilities shall be completed at no cost to the excavator. If, in the opinion of the operator, the planned excavation requires that the precise location of the underground facilities be determined, the excavator, unless otherwise agreed upon between the excavator and the operator, shall hand dig test holes to determine the location of the facilities unless the operator specifies an alternate method.\n\n(2) The marking required under this subsection shall be done in a manner that will last for a minimum of five working days on any nonpermanent surface, or a minimum of ten working days on any permanent surface. If the excavation will continue for any period longer than such periods, the operator shall remark the location of the underground facility upon the request of the excavator. The request shall be made through the notification center.\n\n(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the operator and excavator in writing, no excavation shall be performed within twenty-five feet of an underground natural gas transmission line as defined in\n\n49 C.F.R. §192.3\n\nunless a representative of the operator of the underground natural gas transmission line is present at the planned excavation area. This requirement shall not apply, however, when a representative of the operator fails to be present at the proposed excavation area at the time work is scheduled to commence or as otherwise agreed by the operator and excavator in writing. In this event, the excavator shall notify the operator that the representative failed to appear, and excavation operations can begin, provided the excavator uses due care to avoid damaging the underground facilities.\n\nb. An operator who receives notice from the notification center and who determines that the operator does not have any underground facility located within the proposed area of excavation shall notify the notification center concerning this determination within forty-eight hours after receiving the notice, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. No later than the expiration of the forty-eight-hour period, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, the notification center shall notify the excavator that the operator does not have any underground facilities within the proposed area of excavation.\n\nc. For purposes of this chapter, the “horizontal location of any underground facility” is defined as including an area eighteen inches on either side of the underground facility.\n\nd. For the purposes of this chapter, notifications provided to the excavator by the operator or by the notification center shall be provided in a consistent manner to be established by the board.\n\n4. An excavator is responsible for preserving the markings required in subsection 3 at all times during the excavation. If the markings will be destroyed or otherwise altered during the excavation, the excavator must establish suitable reference points which will enable the excavator to locate the underground facility at all times during the excavation.\n\n5. The operator shall mark the location of any underground facility to conform with the uniform color code established by the American public works association’s utility location and coordination council.\n\n6. The only exception to this section shall be when an emergency exists. Under such conditions, excavation operations can begin immediately, provided reasonable precautions are taken to protect the underground facilities. The excavator shall notify the notification center of the excavation as soon as practical.\n\n92 Acts, ch 1103, §4; 98 Acts, ch 1049, §2; 2014 Acts, ch 1047, §1 – 6; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §149",
