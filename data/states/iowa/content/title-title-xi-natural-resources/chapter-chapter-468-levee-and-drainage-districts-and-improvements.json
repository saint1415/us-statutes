However, where land included in said classification has been destroyed, in whole or in part, by the erosion of a river, or where additional right-of-way has been subsequently taken for drainage purposes, the land which has been so eroded and carried away by the action of a river or which has been taken for additional right-of-way, may be removed by the board from the district as classified, without any reclassification, and no assessment shall thereafter be made on the land so removed. Any deficiency in assessment existing as the result of said action of the board shall be spread by it over the balance of lands remaining in said district in the same ratio as was fixed in the classification of the lands, payable at the next taxpaying period.\n\n2. Except districts established by mutual agreement in accordance with section 468.142 in the event any forty-acre tract or less, or any lot, tract, or parcel, as set forth in the existing classification or reclassification of any drainage district now or hereafter established, is divided into two or more tracts, whether such division is by sale or condemnation or platted as a subdivision, the classification of the original tract shall be apportioned to the resulting parcels, regardless of use, except for land taken for additional drainage right-of-way. The classification of the original tract may be apportioned between the resulting parcels by agreement between the parties to such division. The parties shall file with the county auditor a written agreement setting forth the original description and the description of the tracts as subdivided and the percentage of the original classification apportioned to each. This agreement shall bear the signature of all of the parties to the subdivision. The agreement contemplated herein may be contained in the deed or other instrument effecting the division of the land, which agreement shall be binding upon the grantee or grantees by their acceptance of such instrument and their signatures shall not be necessary. The auditor shall enter this agreement in the drainage record and amend the current classification of the district in accordance with the agreement.\n\n3. In the event the parties to the subdivision cannot agree as to the apportionment of the percentage classification, the board of supervisors shall, upon application of either party, appoint a commission having the qualifications of commissioners, in accordance with section 468.38. The commissioners shall inspect the lands involved and apportion the existing classification of the original tract equitably and fairly to each of the several tracts as subdivided. The board shall make a full, accurate, and detailed report thereof and file the report with the county auditor within the time set by the board.

In the event the parties neither agree as to the apportionment of classification nor make application for the appointment of commissioners, then the auditor of the county in which the land is situated shall make such apportionment upon an equitable basis and enter the same of record as herein provided.

If they find the same to be inequitable in any particular, they shall by resolution express such finding, appoint three commissioners possessing the qualifications prescribed in section 468.38 and order a reclassification as follows:\n\na. If the board finds the assessments to be generally inequitable they shall order a reclassification of all property subject to assessment, such as lands, highways, and railroads in said district.\n\nb. If the inequity ascertained by the board is limited to the proportion paid by highways or railroads, a general reclassification of all lands shall not be necessary but the commissioners may evaluate and determine the fair proportion to be paid by such highways or railroads or both as provided in sections 468.42 and 468.43.\n\nc.

When any levee or drainage district has been established and the improvement constructed, the improvement shall be at all times under the supervision of the board of supervisors except as otherwise provided for control and management by a board of trustees and the board shall keep the improvement in repair as provided in this section.\n\na. The board at any time on its own motion, without notice, may order done whatever is necessary to restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its original efficiency or capacity, and for that purpose may remove silt and debris, repair any damaged structures, remove weeds and other vegetable growth, and whatever else may be needed to restore or maintain such efficiency or capacity or to prolong its useful life.\n\nb. The board may at any time obtain an engineer’s report regarding the most feasible means of repairing a drainage or levee improvement and the probable cost of making the repair. If the engineer advises, or the board otherwise concludes that permanent restoration of a damaged structure is not feasible at the time, the board may order temporary construction it deems necessary to the continued functioning of the improvement. If in maintaining and repairing tile lines the board finds from an engineer’s report it is more economical to construct a new line than to repair the existing line, the new line may be considered to be a repair.\n\nc. If the estimated cost of the repair does not exceed fifty thousand dollars, the board may order the work done without conducting a hearing on the matter. Otherwise, the board shall set a date for a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to landowners in the district by publication in the same manner as provided in section 468.15. However, if the estimated cost of the repair exceeds the adjusted competitive bid threshold, the board shall provide notice to the landowners pursuant to sections 468.14 through 468.18. The board shall not divide a proposed repair into separate programs in order to avoid the notice and hearing requirements of this paragraph.\n\nd. Notwithstanding paragraph “b”, if the estimated cost of the repair exceeds fifty thousand dollars or the adjusted competitive bid threshold, whichever is more, the board shall order an engineer’s report or a report from the soil and water conservation district conservationist regarding the matter which shall be presented at the hearing provided in paragraph “c”. The board may waive the report requirement if a prior report on the repair exists and that report is less than ten years old. At the hearing, the board shall hear objections to the feasibility of making the proposed repair.\n\ne. Following a hearing, if required in paragraph “c”, the board shall determine whether the repair is necessary or desirable, and feasible.\n\nf. Any interested party has the right of appeal from such orders in the manner provided in this subchapter, parts 1 through 5.\n\ng. The right of remonstrance does not apply to a repair as provided in this section.\n\n2. In the case of a repair, or the eradication of brush or weeds along the open ditches, not in excess of the adjusted competitive bid threshold, where the board finds that a saving to the district will result, the board may cause the repairs or eradication to be done by secondary road fund equipment, or weed fund equipment, and labor of the county and then reimburse the secondary road fund or the weed fund from the fund of the drainage district thus benefited.\n\n3. When the board deems it necessary it may repair or reconstruct the outlet of any private tile line which empties into a drainage ditch of any district and assess the costs in each case against the land served by the private tile line.\n\n4. a. For the purpose of this subsection, an “improvement” in a drainage or levee district in which any ditch, tile drain, or other facility has previously been constructed is a project intended to expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase the capacity of any existing ditch, drain, or other facility above that for which it was designed.\n\nb. When the board determines that an improvement is necessary or desirable, and feasible, the board shall appoint an engineer to make surveys as seem appropriate to determine the nature and extent of the improvement, and to file a report showing what improvement is recommended and its estimated cost, which report may be amended before final action.\n\nc. If the estimated cost of the improvement does not exceed fifty thousand dollars, the board may order the work done without conducting a hearing on the matter. Otherwise, the board shall set a date for a hearing on whether to construct the proposed improvement and whether there shall be a reclassification of benefits for the cost of the proposed improvement.\n\n(1) (a) The board shall provide notice to landowners in the district by publication in the same manner as provided in section 468.15. However, if the estimated cost of the improvement exceeds the adjusted competitive bid threshold, the board shall provide notice to the landowners pursuant to sections 468.14 through 468.18.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subparagraph division (a), and in lieu of publishing the notice, the board may mail a copy of the notice to each address where a landowner within the district resides by first class mail if the cost of mailing is less than publication of the notice. The mailing shall be made during the time the notice would otherwise be required to be published.\n\n(2) The board shall not divide proposed improvements into separate programs in order to avoid compliance with this paragraph “c”.\n\nd. At the hearing, if required in paragraph “c”, the board shall hear objections to the feasibility of the proposed improvements and arguments for or against a reclassification presented by or for any taxpayer of the district. Following the hearing, the board shall order that the improvement it deems necessary or desirable and feasible be made and shall also determine whether there should be a reclassification of benefits for the cost of the improvement. If it is determined that a reclassification of benefits should be made, the board shall proceed as provided in section 468.38.\n\ne. If the estimated cost of the improvement exceeds the adjusted competitive bid threshold, or the original cost of the district plus the cost of subsequent improvements in the district, whichever amount is greater, a majority of the landowners, owning in the aggregate more than seventy percent of the total land in the district, may file a written remonstrance against the proposed improvement, at or before the date set for hearing on the proposed improvement as provided in paragraph “c”, with the county auditor, or auditors in case the district extends into more than one county. If a remonstrance is filed, the board shall discontinue and dismiss all further proceedings on the proposed improvements and charge the costs incurred to date for the proposed improvements to the district. Any interested party may appeal from such orders in the manner provided in this subchapter, parts 1 through 5. However, this section does not affect the procedures of section 468.132 covering the common outlet.\n\n5. Where under the laws in force prior to 1904 drainage ditches and levees were established and constructed without fixing at the time of establishment a definite boundary line for the body of land to be assessed for the cost thereof, the body of land which was last assessed to pay for the repair thereof shall also be considered as the established district for the purpose of this section.\n\n6. The governing body of the district may, by contract or conveyance, acquire, within or without the district, the necessary lands or easements for making repairs or improvements under this section, including easements for borrow and easements for meander, and in addition thereto, the same may be obtained in the manner provided in the original establishment of the district, or by exercise of the power of eminent domain as provided for in chapter 6B. If additional right-of-way is required for any repair or improvement under this section, the same may be acquired in the same manner as provided for the acquisition of right-of-way in the original establishment of a district, except that where notice and hearing are not otherwise required under this section notice as provided in this subchapter, parts 1 through 5, to owners, lienholder of record, and occupants of the land from which right-of-way is to be acquired shall suffice.\n\n7. In existing districts where the stream has by erosion appropriated lands beyond its original right-of-way and it is more economical and feasible to acquire an easement for such erosion and meander than to undertake containment of the stream in its existing right-of-way, the board may, in the discharge of the duties enjoined upon it by this section, effect such acquisition as to the whole or part of the course. Right-of-way so taken shall be classed an improvement for the purpose of procedure under this section.\n\n8. If the drainage records on file in the auditor’s office for a particular district do not define specifically the land taken for right-of-way for drainage purposes, the board may at any time upon its own motion employ a land surveyor to make a survey and report of the district and to actually define the right-of-way taken for drainage purposes. After the land surveyor has filed the survey and report with the board, the board shall fix a date for hearing on the report and shall serve notice of the hearing upon all landowners and lienholder of record and occupants of the lands traversed by the right-of-way in the manner and for the time required for service of original notices in the district court. At the hearing the board shall specifically define the land taken for the right-of-way. Once established, the right-of-way constitutes a permanent easement in favor of the drainage district for drainage purposes including the right of ingress and egress across adjoining land and the right of access for maintenance, repair, improvement and inspection. A person aggrieved by the action or failure to act of the board under this subsection may appeal only in compliance with sections 468.83 through 468.98.\n\n[S13, §1989-a21; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §7556, 7558 – 7561; C46, §455.135, 455.137 – 455.140; C50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §455.135; 81 Acts, ch 150, §1]\n\n85 Acts, ch 163, §8, 9; 87 Acts, ch 23, §15; 87 Acts, ch 143, §1; 89 Acts, ch 126, §2\n\nCS89, §468.126\n\n94 Acts, ch 1051, §7, 8; 2004 Acts, ch 1051, §1 – 3; 2008 Acts, ch 1047, §1 – 4; 2014 Acts, ch 1075, §14 – 16; 2015 Acts, ch 51, §9 – 12; 2021 Acts, ch 27, §3\n\nReferred to in §461A.76, 468.41, 468.57, 468.119, 468.127, 468.131, 468.132, 468.201, 468.260, 468.359, 468.396",

In lieu of the hearing provided for in subsections 1 through 5, the board may, and if the petition of owners provided for in subsections 1 through 5 so asks, the board shall call for an election for the purpose of determining the question of classification on the basis of assessed value of lands and land improvements. The question may be submitted at a regular election of the district or at a special election called for that purpose. It shall not be mandatory for the county commissioner of elections to conduct the elections, however provisions of sections 49.43 through 49.47 and of subchapter III of this chapter, insofar as the same are applicable, shall govern all such elections, and the question to be submitted shall be set forth in the notice of election. If sixty percent of the votes cast be in favor of the proposed change in assessment, it shall become effective for all future assessments as heretofore provided in this section. If the question should fail, no new election on the subject may be called for a period of one year.\n\n7. When a levee district has been established and constructed, as an alternative to the other methods prescribed by law, upon reclassification, the levee district may adopt a method of classification and assessment uniform as to all land in the district, including railroad land, public highways and other public land and land exempt from general taxation, based on the total amount to be assessed divided by the total acres within the district. This method of classification and assessment may be adopted either by hearing or by election and shall become effective as heretofore provided in this section.\n\n8. When a drainage district or drainage and levee district has been established and constructed, and after the lands therein have been classified in accordance with the provisions of sections 468.39, 468.40, and 468.41 or reclassified in accordance with section 468.65, the district may adopt methods of assessment for maintenance, repair, and operation of said district uniform as to all land in the district in the same manner and by the same procedures as prescribed in subsections 1 through 7 of this section. Provided, however, that only those lands drained by respective mains and laterals shall be assessed for maintenance, repair, and operation of said mains and laterals, and provided further that this alternate method of assessment shall not be applied to making improvements in the drainage system.\n\n9. Following the adoption of any alternative method of classification or assessment as provided in this section, the same shall continue in effect until such time as the method is changed pursuant to this section or to section 468.65.\n\n10. a. All proceedings taken prior to July 1, 1968, purporting to establish or reestablish a drainage or levee district or districts, or to enlarge or change the boundaries of any drainage or levee district, and any assessments not heretofore declared invalid by any court, are hereby legalized, validated, and confirmed.\n\nb.

If the public improvement is such as to leave two separate portions of the improvement that are still operable and of benefit to the land on each side of the division made by the public improvement, then the board may divide the district into two separate units so that each may perform further work on the improvements in their respective parts, but neither shall be charged for work completed on the opposite side of the new improvement that divides them and may only be charged for the work done in that portion of the district remaining on their side of the division.\n\n3.
