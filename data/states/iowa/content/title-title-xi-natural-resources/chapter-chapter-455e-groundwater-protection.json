      "text": "455E.3 Findings.\n\nThe general assembly finds that:\n\n1. Groundwater is a precious and vulnerable natural resource. The vast majority of persons in the state depend on groundwater as a drinking water source. Agriculture, commerce, and industry also depend heavily on groundwater. Historically, the majority of Iowa’s groundwater has been usable for these purposes without treatment. Protection of groundwater is essential to the health, welfare, and economic prosperity of all citizens of the state.\n\n2. Many activities of humans, including the manufacturing, storing, handling, and application to land of pesticides and fertilizers; the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the storing and handling of hazardous substances; and the improper construction and the abandonment of wells and septic systems have resulted in groundwater contamination throughout the state.\n\n3. Knowledge of the health effects of contaminants varies greatly. The long-term detriment to human health from synthetic organic compounds in particular is largely unknown but is of concern.\n\n4. Any detectable quantity of a synthetic organic compound in groundwater is unnatural and undesirable.\n\n5. The movement of groundwater, and the movement of contaminants in groundwater, are often difficult to ascertain or control. Decontamination is difficult and expensive to accomplish. Therefore, preventing contamination of groundwater is of paramount importance.\n\n87 Acts, ch 225, §103",

The discovery of any groundwater contamination shall require appropriate actions to prevent further contamination. These actions may consist of investigation and evaluation or enforcement actions if necessary to stop further contamination as required under chapter 455B.\n\n3. All persons in the state have the right to have their lawful use of groundwater unimpaired by the activities of any person which render the water unsafe or unpotable.\n\n4. All persons in the state have the duty to conduct their activities so as to prevent the release of contaminants into groundwater.\n\n5. Documentation of any contaminant which presents a significant risk to human health, the environment, or the quality of life shall result in either passive or active cleanup. In both cases, the best technology available or best management practices shall be utilized. The department shall adopt rules which specify the general guidelines for determining the cleanup actions necessary to meet the goals of the state and the general procedures for determining the parties responsible by July 1, 1989. Until the rules are adopted, the absence of rules shall not be raised as a defense to an order to clean up a source of contamination.\n\n6. Adopting health-related groundwater standards may be of benefit in the overall groundwater protection or other regulatory efforts of the state. However, the existence of such standards, or lack of them, shall not be construed or utilized in derogation of the groundwater protection goal and protection policies of the state.\n\n7. The department shall take actions necessary to promote and assure public confidence and public awareness. In pursuing this goal, the department shall make public the results of groundwater investigations.\n\n8. Education of the people of the state is necessary to preserve and restore groundwater quality. The content of this groundwater protection education must assign obligations, call for sacrifice, and change some current values. Educational efforts should strive to establish a conservation ethic among Iowans and should encourage each Iowan to go beyond enlightened self-interest in the protection of groundwater quality.\n\n87 Acts, ch 225, §105",

In the event of a conflict between this section and another provision of this chapter, it is the intent of the general assembly that this section prevails.\n\n2. Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for the costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or resulting from the detection in the groundwater of any quantity of nitrates provided that application has been in compliance with soil test results and that the applicator has properly complied with label instructions for application of the fertilizer. Compliance with the above provisions may be raised as an affirmative defense by an agricultural producer.\n\n3. Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or resulting from the detection in the groundwater of pesticide provided that the applicator has properly complied with label instructions for application of the pesticide and that the applicator has a valid appropriate applicator’s license.
