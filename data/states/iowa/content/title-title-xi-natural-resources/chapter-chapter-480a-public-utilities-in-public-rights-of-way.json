A public utility that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way permit, that has its right-of-way permit revoked, or that believes that the fees imposed on such user by the local government do not conform to the requirements of this chapter may request in writing that such denial, revocation, or fee imposition be reviewed by the governing body of the local government.

Upon affirmation by the governing body of the denial, revocation, or fee imposition, the public utility may do either of the following:\n\na. With the consent of the governing body, have the matter finally resolved by binding arbitration. Binding arbitration must be before an arbitrator agreed to by both the local government and the public utility. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the matter shall be resolved by a three-person arbitration panel made up of one arbitrator selected by the local government, one arbitrator selected by the public utility, and one arbitrator selected by the other two arbitrators. The cost and expense of a single arbitrator shall be borne equally by the local government and the public utility. If a three-person arbitration panel is selected, each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and the parties shall jointly and equally bear the cost and expense of the third arbitrator, and of the arbitration. Each party to the arbitration shall pay its own costs, disbursements, and attorney fees.\n\nb.
