To be considered a violation that is applicable to a habitual violator determination, a violation must have been committed on or after January 1, 1995. In addition, each violation must have been referred to the attorney general for legal action under this chapter, and each violation must be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty or a court conviction, in the five years prior to the date of the latest violation provided in this subsection, counting any violation committed by a confinement feeding operation in which the person holds a controlling interest. A person shall be removed from the classification of habitual violator on the date on which the person and all confinement feeding operations in which the person holds a controlling interest have committed less than three violations described in this subsection for the prior five years. For purposes of counting violations, a continuing and uninterrupted violation shall be considered as one violation. Different types of violations shall be counted as separate violations regardless of whether the violations were committed during the same period. A violation must relate to one of the following:\n\n(1) The construction or operation of a confinement feeding operation structure, or the installation or use of a related pollution control device or practice, for which the person must obtain a permit, in violation of this chapter, or rules adopted by the department, including the terms or conditions of the permit.\n\n(2) Intentionally making a false statement or misrepresenting information to the department as part of an application for a construction permit for a confinement feeding operation structure, or the installation of a related pollution control device or practice for which the person must obtain a construction permit.\n\n(3) Failing to obtain a permit or approval by the department in violation of this chapter or departmental rule which requires a permit to construct or operate a confinement feeding operation or use a confinement feeding operation structure, anaerobic lagoon, or a pollution control device or practice which is part of a confinement feeding operation.\n\n(4) Operating a confinement feeding operation, including a confinement feeding operation structure, or a related pollution control device or practice, which causes pollution to the waters of the state, if the pollution was caused intentionally, or caused by a failure to take measures required to abate the pollution which resulted from an act of God.\n\n(5) Failing to submit a manure management plan as required pursuant to section 459.312, or operating a confinement feeding operation without having a manure management plan approved by the department.\n\nb.
