The program shall use information, education, monitoring, technical assistance, data gathering and evaluation, incentives, and more efficient issuance of permits. The program is expected to have a menu of initiatives and approaches to appeal to a broad audience of participants and shall be coordinated so that individual initiatives work toward the objective of improved water quality. The departments of agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall work cooperatively with federal agencies to obtain waivers and changes in rules and procedures at national and state levels to improve the federal programs’ environmental and economic performance for Iowans. State agencies shall collaborate with other state agencies to attain the overall goal of improved water quality. The state department of transportation and the department of natural resources shall collaborate to provide for the preservation of topsoil, erosion control, water impoundment during highway construction and reconstruction, and restoration and management of roadside right-of-way for prairie restoration, wildlife habitat, and erosion control.\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1068, §2",
