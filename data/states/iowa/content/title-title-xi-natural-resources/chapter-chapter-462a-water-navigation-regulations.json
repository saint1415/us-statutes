The owner of each vessel required to be numbered by this state shall initially register it with the commission through the county recorder of the county in which the owner resides, or, if the owner is a nonresident, the owner shall register it in the county in which such vessel is principally used. Both residents and nonresidents shall subsequently renew registration every three years with any county recorder. The commission shall develop and maintain an electronic system for the registration of vessels pursuant to this chapter. The commission shall establish forms and procedures as necessary for the registration of all vessels.\n\na. The owner of the vessel shall file an application for registration with the appropriate county recorder on forms provided by the commission. The application shall be completed and signed by the owner of the vessel and shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee, and the writing fee specified in section 462A.53. Upon applying for registration, the owner shall display a bill of sale, receipt, or other satisfactory proof of ownership as provided by the rules of the commission to the county recorder. If the county recorder is not satisfied as to the ownership of the vessel or that there are no undisclosed security interests in the vessel, the county recorder may register the vessel but shall, as a condition of issuing a registration certificate, require the applicant to follow the procedure provided in section 462A.5A. Upon receipt of the application in approved form accompanied by the required fees, the county recorder shall enter it upon the records of the recorder’s office and shall issue to the applicant a pocket-size registration certificate. The certificate shall be executed and delivered to the owner. The county recorder shall maintain an electronic record of each registration certificate issued by the county recorder under this chapter. The registration certificate shall bear the number awarded to the vessel, the passenger capacity of the vessel, and the name and address of the owner. In the use of all vessels except nonpowered sailboats, nonpowered canoes, and commercial vessels, the registration certificate shall be carried either in the vessel or on the person of the operator of the vessel when in use. In the use of nonpowered sailboats, nonpowered canoes, or commercial vessels, the registration certificate may be kept on shore in accordance with rules adopted by the commission. The operator shall exhibit the certificate to a peace officer upon request or, when involved in an occurrence of any nature with another vessel or other personal property, to the owner or operator of the other vessel or personal property.\n\nb. A vessel that has an expired registration certificate from another state may be registered in this state upon proper application, payment of all applicable registration and writing fees, and payment of a penalty of five dollars.\n\nc. On all vessels except nonpowered sailboats the owner shall cause the identification number to be painted on or attached to each side of the bow of the vessel in such size and manner as may be prescribed by the rules of the commission. On nonpowered boats the number may be placed at alternate locations as prescribed by the rules of the commission. All numbers shall be maintained in a legible condition at all times.\n\nd. No number, other than the number awarded to a vessel under the provisions of this chapter or granted reciprocity pursuant to this chapter, shall be painted, attached or otherwise displayed on either side of the bow of such vessel.\n\ne. The owner of each vessel must display and maintain, in a legible manner and in a prominent spot on the exterior of such vessel, other than the bow, the passenger capacity of the vessel which must conform with the passenger capacity designated on the registration certificate.\n\n2. When an agency of the United States government shall have in force an overall system of identification numbering for vessels, the numbering system prescribed by the commission pursuant to this chapter, shall be in conformity therewith.\n\n3. a. The registration fees for vessels subject to this chapter are as follows:\n\n(1) For vessels of any length without motor or sail, twelve dollars.\n\n(2) For motorboats or sailboats less than sixteen feet in length, twenty-two dollars and fifty cents.\n\n(3) For motorboats or sailboats sixteen feet or more, but less than twenty-six feet in length, thirty-six dollars.\n\n(4) For motorboats or sailboats twenty-six feet or more, but less than forty feet in length, seventy-five dollars.\n\n(5) For motorboats or sailboats forty feet in length or more, one hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(6) For all personal watercraft, forty-five dollars.\n\nb. Every registration certificate and number issued becomes delinquent at midnight April 30 of the last calendar year of the registration period unless terminated or discontinued in accordance with this chapter. After January 1, 2007, an unregistered vessel and a renewal of registration may be registered for the three-year registration period beginning May 1 of that year. When unregistered vessels are registered after May 1 of the second year of the three-year registration period, such unregistered vessels may be registered for the remainder of the current registration period at two-thirds of the appropriate registration fee. When unregistered vessels are registered after May 1 of the third year of the three-year registration period, such unregistered vessels may be registered for the remainder of the current registration period at one-third of the appropriate registration fee.\n\nc. If an application for renewal is not made before July 1 of the last calendar year of the registration period, the applicant shall be charged a penalty of five dollars.\n\n4. a. If a person, after registering a vessel, moves from the address shown on the registration certificate, the person shall, within ten days, notify any county recorder of the new address.\n\nb. If the name of a person who has registered a vessel is changed, the person shall, within ten days, notify any county recorder of the former and new name.\n\nc. No fee shall be paid to any county recorder for making the changes mentioned in this subsection unless the owner requests a new registration certificate showing the change, in which case a fee of one dollar plus a writing fee shall be paid to the recorder.\n\nd. If a registration certificate is lost, mutilated, or becomes illegible, the owner shall immediately make application for and obtain a duplicate registration certificate by furnishing information satisfactory to any county recorder. A fee of one dollar plus a writing fee shall be paid to the county recorder for a duplicate registration certificate.\n\ne.

The owner of each vessel which has a valid marine document issued by the bureau of customs of the United States government or any federal agency successor thereto shall register it every three years with the county recorder in the same manner prescribed for undocumented vessels and shall cause the registration validation decal to be placed on the vessel in the manner prescribed by the rules of the commission. When the vessel bears the identification required in the documentation, it is exempt from the placement of the identification numbers as required on undocumented vessels. The fee for such registration is twenty-five dollars plus a writing fee.\n\n7. If the owner of a currently registered vessel places the vessel in storage, the owner shall return the registration certificate to the county recorder with an affidavit stating that the vessel is placed in storage and the effective date of the storage. The county recorder shall notify the commission of each registered vessel placed in storage. When the owner of a stored vessel desires to renew the vessel’s registration, the owner shall apply to the county recorder and pay the registration fees plus a writing fee as provided in subsections 1 and 3 without penalty. No refund of registration fees shall be allowed for a stored vessel.\n\n8. The registration certificate shall indicate if the vessel is subject to the requirement of a certificate of title and the county from which the certificate of title is issued.\n\n[C97, §2512; S13, §2512; C24, 27, 31, §1694; C35, §1703-e3, 1703-e7; C39, §1703.03, 1703.07, 1703.08; C46, 50, 54, 58, §106.3, 106.7, 106.8; C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §106.5; 82 Acts, ch 1028, §6 – 9]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1082, §1, 2; 85 Acts, ch 110, §1; 87 Acts, ch 134, §3; 92 Acts, ch 1101, §1\n\nC93, §462A.5\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1019, §2; 2002 Acts, ch 1113, §9; 2005 Acts, ch 137, §4 – 7; 2007 Acts, ch 28, §3, 4; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §119, 143; 2014 Acts, ch 1141, §71; 2019 Acts, ch 80, §3 – 5; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §55\n\nReferred to in §331.602, 331.605, 462A.5A, 462A.6A, 805.8B(1)(a)\n\nFor applicable scheduled fines, see §805.8B, subsection 1, paragraph a",

A class “D” felony for any offense under this section resulting in serious injury to persons other than the defendant, if the court determines that the person who committed the offense caused the serious injury, and shall be imprisoned for a determinate sentence of not more than five years but not less than thirty days, or committed to the custody of the director of the department of corrections, and assessed a fine of not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more than seven thousand five hundred dollars. A person convicted of a felony offense may be committed to the custody of the director of the department of corrections, who shall assign the person to a facility pursuant to section 904.513. The court shall also order that the person not operate a motorboat or sailboat for one year in addition to any other period of time the defendant would have been ordered not to operate if no injury had occurred in connection with the violation. The court shall also assign the defendant to substance use disorder evaluation and treatment pursuant to subsections 12 and 13, and a course for drinking drivers.\n\ne. A class “B” felony for any offense under this section resulting in the death of persons other than the defendant, if the court determines that the person who committed the offense caused the death, and shall be imprisoned for a determinate sentence of not more than twenty-five years, or committed to the custody of the director of the department of corrections. A person convicted of a felony offense may be committed to the custody of the director of the department of corrections, who shall assign the person to a facility pursuant to section 904.513. The court shall also order that the person not operate a motorboat or sailboat for six years. The court shall also assign the defendant to substance use disorder evaluation and treatment pursuant to subsections 12 and 13, and a course for drinking drivers.\n\n3. a. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 901.5 and 907.3, the court shall not defer judgment or sentencing, or suspend execution of any mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration applicable to the defendant under subsection 2, and shall not suspend execution of any other part of a sentence not involving incarceration imposed pursuant to subsection 2, if any of the following apply:\n\n(1) If the defendant’s alcohol concentration established by the results of an analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine withdrawn in accordance with this chapter exceeds .15, regardless of whether or not the alcohol concentration indicated by the chemical test minus the established margin of error inherent in the device or method used to conduct the test equals an alcohol concentration of .15 or more.\n\n(2) If the defendant has previously been convicted of a violation of subsection 1 or a statute in another state substantially corresponding to subsection 1.\n\n(3) If the defendant has previously received a deferred judgment or sentence for a violation of subsection 1 or for a violation of a statute in another state substantially corresponding to subsection 1.\n\n(4) If the defendant refused to consent to testing requested in accordance with section 462A.14A.\n\n(5) If the offense under this section results in bodily injury to a person other than the defendant.\n\nb. A minimum term of imprisonment in a county jail or community-based correctional facility imposed on a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under subsection 2 shall be served on consecutive days. However, if the sentencing court finds that service of the full minimum term on consecutive days would work an undue hardship on the person, or finds that sufficient jail space is not available and is not reasonably expected to become available within four months after sentencing to incarcerate the person serving the minimum sentence on consecutive days, the court may order the person to serve the minimum term in segments of at least forty-eight hours and to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid community service as deemed appropriate by the sentencing court.\n\n4. In determining if a violation charged is a second or subsequent offense for purposes of criminal sentencing or license or privilege revocation under this section:\n\na. Any conviction under this section within the previous twelve years shall be counted as a previous offense.\n\nb. Deferred judgments entered pursuant to section 907.3 for violations of this section shall be counted as previous offenses.\n\nc. Convictions or the equivalent of deferred judgments for violations in any other states under statutes substantially corresponding to this section shall be counted as previous offenses. The courts shall judicially notice the statutes of other states which define offenses substantially equivalent to an offense defined in this section and can therefore be considered corresponding statutes. Each previous violation on which conviction or deferral of judgment was entered prior to the date of the violation charged shall be considered and counted as a separate previous offense.\n\n5. A person shall not be convicted and sentenced for more than one violation of this section for actions arising out of the same event or occurrence, even if the event or occurrence involves more than one of the conditions specified in subsection 1. However, a person who refuses a test pursuant to section 462A.14B may be subject to imposition of the penalties under that section in addition to the penalties under this section if the person violates both sections, even though the actions arise out of the same event or occurrence.\n\n6. The clerk of the district court shall immediately certify to the department a true copy of each order entered with respect to deferral of judgment, deferral of sentence, or pronouncement of judgment and sentence for a defendant under this section.\n\n7. a. This section does not apply to a person operating a motorboat or sailboat while under the influence of a drug if the substance was prescribed for the person and was taken under the prescription and in accordance with the directions of a medical practitioner as defined in chapter 155A or if the substance was dispensed by a pharmacist without a prescription pursuant to the rules of the board of pharmacy, if there is no evidence of the consumption of alcohol and the medical practitioner or pharmacist had not directed the person to refrain from operating a motor vehicle, or motorboat or sailboat.\n\nb. When charged with a violation of subsection 1, paragraph “c”, a person may assert, as an affirmative defense, that the controlled substance present in the person’s blood or urine was prescribed or dispensed for the person and was taken in accordance with the directions of a practitioner and the labeling directions of the pharmacy, as that person and place of business are defined in section 155A.3.\n\n8. In any prosecution under this section, evidence of the results of analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine is admissible upon proof of a proper foundation.\n\na. The alcohol concentration established by the results of an analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine withdrawn within two hours after the defendant was operating or in physical control of a motorboat or sailboat is presumed to be the alcohol concentration at the time of operating or being in physical control of the motorboat or sailboat.\n\nb. The presence of a controlled substance or other drug established by the results of analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood or urine withdrawn within two hours after the defendant was operating or in physical control of a motorboat or sailboat is presumed to show the presence of such controlled substance or other drug in the defendant at the time of operating or being in physical control of the motorboat or sailboat.\n\nc. The nationally accepted standards for determining detectable levels of controlled substances in the division of criminal investigation’s initial laboratory screening test for controlled substances adopted by the department of public safety shall be utilized in prosecutions under this section.\n\n9. a. In addition to any fine or penalty imposed under this chapter, the court shall order a defendant convicted of or receiving a deferred judgment for a violation of this section to make restitution for damages resulting directly from the violation, to the victim, pursuant to chapter 910. An amount paid pursuant to this restitution order shall be credited toward any adverse judgment in a subsequent civil proceeding arising from the same occurrence. However, other than establishing a credit, a restitution proceeding pursuant to this section shall not be given evidentiary or preclusive effect in a subsequent civil proceeding arising from the same occurrence.\n\nb. The court may order restitution paid to any public agency for the costs of the emergency response resulting from the actions constituting a violation of this section, not exceeding five hundred dollars per public agency for each such response. For the purposes of this paragraph, “emergency response” means any incident requiring response by fire fighting, law enforcement, ambulance, medical, or other emergency services. A public agency seeking such restitution shall consult with the county attorney regarding the expenses incurred by the public agency, and the county attorney may include the expenses in the statement of pecuniary damages pursuant to section 910.3.\n\n10. In any prosecution under this section, the results of a chemical test shall not be used to prove a violation of subsection 1, paragraph “b” or paragraph “c”, if the alcohol, controlled substance, or other drug concentration indicated by the chemical test minus the established margin of error inherent in the device or method used to conduct the chemical test does not equal or exceed the level prohibited by subsection 1.\n\n11. This section does not limit the introduction of any competent evidence bearing on the question of whether a person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or a controlled substance or other drug, including the results of chemical tests of specimens of blood, breath, or urine obtained more than two hours after the person was operating a motorboat or sailboat.\n\n12. a. All substance use disorder evaluations required under this section shall be completed at the defendant’s expense.\n\nb. In addition to assignment to substance use disorder evaluation and treatment under this section, the court shall order any defendant convicted under this section to follow the recommendations proposed in the substance use disorder evaluation for appropriate substance use disorder treatment for the defendant. Court-ordered substance use disorder treatment is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section 125.86.\n\nc. If a defendant is committed by the court to a substance use disorder treatment facility, the administrator of the facility shall report to the court when it is determined that the defendant has received the maximum benefit of treatment at the facility and the defendant shall be released from the facility. The time for which the defendant is committed for treatment shall be credited against the defendant’s sentence.\n\nd. The court may prescribe the length of time for the evaluation and treatment or the court may request that the community college or licensed substance use disorder program conducting the course for drinking drivers which the defendant is ordered to attend or the treatment program to which the defendant is committed immediately report to the court when the defendant has received maximum benefit from the course for drinking drivers or treatment program or has recovered from the defendant’s addiction, dependency, or tendency to chronically use alcohol or drugs.\n\ne. Upon successfully completing a course for drinking drivers or an ordered substance use disorder treatment program, a court may place the defendant on probation for six months and as a condition of probation, the defendant shall attend a program providing posttreatment services relating to substance use disorder as approved by the court.\n\nf. A defendant committed under this section who does not possess sufficient income or estate to make payment of the costs of the treatment in whole or in part shall be considered a state patient and the costs of treatment shall be paid as provided in section 125.44.\n\ng. A defendant who fails to carry out the order of the court shall be confined in the county jail for twenty days in addition to any other imprisonment ordered by the court or may be ordered to perform unpaid community service work, and shall be placed on probation for one year with a violation of this probation punishable as contempt of court.\n\nh. In addition to any other condition of probation, the defendant shall attend a program providing substance use disorder prevention services or posttreatment services related to substance use disorder as ordered by the court. The defendant shall report to the defendant’s probation officer as ordered concerning proof of attendance at the treatment program or posttreatment program ordered by the court. Failure to attend or complete the program shall be considered a violation of probation and is punishable as contempt of court.\n\n13. a. Upon a second or subsequent offense in violation of section 462A.14, the court upon hearing may commit the defendant for inpatient treatment of alcoholism or drug addiction or dependency to any hospital, institution, or community correctional facility in this state providing such treatment. The time for which the defendant is committed for treatment shall be credited against the defendant’s sentence.\n\nb. The court may prescribe the length of time for the evaluation and treatment or the court may request that the hospital to which the defendant is committed immediately report to the court when the defendant has received maximum benefit from the program of the hospital or institution or has recovered from the defendant’s addiction, dependency, or tendency to chronically abuse alcohol or drugs.\n\nc. A defendant committed under this section who does not possess sufficient income or estate to make payment of the costs of the treatment in whole or in part shall be considered a state patient and the costs of treatment shall be paid as provided in section 125.44.\n\n[C97, §2513; S13, §2513; C24, 27, 31, §1695; C35, §1703-e5; C39, §1703.05; C46, 50, 54, 58, §106.5, 106.28; C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §106.14; 82 Acts, ch 1028, §18]\n\nC93, §462A.14\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1099, §2; 2000 Acts, ch 1232, §74; 2007 Acts, ch 10, §176; 2011 Acts, ch 24, §2; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1167 – 1171\n\nReferred to in §462A.2, 462A.14A, 462A.14B, 462A.14C, 462A.14D, 462A.14E, 462A.14F, 462A.34B, 811.1, 907.3, 915.80\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph a, subparagraph (4) amended\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph b, subparagraph (4) amended\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph c, subparagraph (4) amended\n\nSubsection 2, paragraphs d and e amended\n\nSubsection 12 amended",

A person who operates a motorboat or sailboat on the navigable waters in this state under circumstances which give reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been operating a motorboat or sailboat in violation of section 462A.14 is deemed to have given consent to the withdrawal of specimens of the person’s blood, breath, or urine and to a chemical test or tests of the specimens for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of controlled substances or other drugs, subject to this section.\n\n2. a. If a peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that any of the following has occurred, the peace officer may request that the motorboat or sailboat operator provide a sample of the operator’s breath for a preliminary screening test using a device approved by the commissioner of public safety for that purpose:\n\n(1) The motorboat or sailboat operator may be violating or has violated section 462A.14.\n\n(2) The motorboat or sailboat has been involved in an accident resulting in injury or death.\n\n(3) The motorboat or sailboat operator is or has been operating carelessly or recklessly, in violation of section 462A.12.\n\nb. The results of this preliminary screening test may be used for the purpose of deciding whether an arrest should be made or whether to request a chemical test authorized in this chapter, but shall not be used in any court action except to prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person pursuant to this section.\n\n3. The withdrawal of the body substances and the test or tests shall be administered at the written request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the person was operating a motorboat or sailboat in violation of section 462A.14, and if any of the following conditions exist:\n\na. A peace officer has lawfully placed the person under arrest for violation of section 462A.14.\n\nb. The motorboat or sailboat has been involved in an occurrence resulting in personal injury or death.\n\nc. The person has refused to take a preliminary breath screening test provided by this chapter.\n\nd. The preliminary breath screening test was administered and it indicated an alcohol concentration equal to or in excess of the level prohibited by section 462A.14.\n\ne. The preliminary breath screening test was administered and it indicated an alcohol concentration of less than the level prohibited under section 462A.14, and the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was under the influence of a controlled substance, a drug other than alcohol or a combination of alcohol and another drug.\n\n4. a. The peace officer shall determine which of the three substances, breath, blood, or urine, shall be tested.\n\nb. If the peace officer fails to offer a test within two hours after the preliminary screening test is administered or refused, or the arrest is made, whichever occurs first, a test is not required, and there shall be no suspension of motorboat or sailboat operation privileges.\n\nc. Refusal to submit to a chemical test of urine or breath is deemed a refusal to submit, and the peace officer shall inform the person that the person’s refusal will result in the suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motorboat or sailboat.\n\nd. Refusal to submit to a chemical test of blood is not deemed a refusal to submit, but in that case, the peace officer shall then determine which one of the other two substances shall be tested and shall offer the test.\n\ne. Notwithstanding paragraphs “a” through “d”, if the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was under the influence of a drug other than alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and another drug, a urine test may be required even after a blood or breath test has been administered.\n\nf. A person who is dead, unconscious, or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of consent or refusal is deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by this section, and the test may be given if a licensed physician certifies in advance of the test that the person is dead, unconscious, or otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of consent or refusal.\n\ng. A person who has been requested to submit to a chemical test shall be advised by a peace officer of the following:\n\n(1) A refusal to submit to the test is punishable by a mandatory civil penalty of five hundred to two thousand dollars, and suspension of motorboat or sailboat operating privileges for at least a year. In addition, if the person is also convicted of operating a motorboat or sailboat while intoxicated, the person shall be subject to additional penalties.\n\n(2) If the person submits to the test and the results indicate an alcohol concentration equal to or in excess of the level prohibited under section 462A.14 and the person is convicted, the person’s motorboat or sailboat operating privileges will be suspended for at least one year and up to six years, depending upon how many previous convictions the person has under this chapter, and whether or not the person has caused serious injury or death, in addition to any sentence and fine imposed for a violation of section 462A.14.\n\n5. Refusal to submit to a test under this section does not prohibit the withdrawal of a specimen for chemical testing if a motorboat or sailboat has been involved in an accident resulting in death or serious bodily injury, if the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the operator of the motorboat or sailboat was violating section 462A.14 at the time of the accident, and the peace officer has obtained, in compliance with chapter 808 or according to the procedure in section 462A.14D, a search warrant permitting the withdrawal of a specimen for chemical testing. The act of any person knowingly resisting or obstructing the withdrawal of a specimen pursuant to a search warrant issued under this section constitutes a contempt punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or by both such fine and imprisonment, and further constitutes a refusal to submit, punishable under this section.\n\n6. Only a licensed physician, licensed physician assistant as defined in section 148C.1, medical technologist, or registered nurse, acting at the request of a peace officer, may withdraw a specimen of blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or the presence of a controlled substance or other drugs. However, any peace officer, using devices and methods approved by the commissioner of public safety, may take a specimen of a person’s breath or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or the presence of drugs. Only new equipment kept under strictly sanitary and sterile conditions shall be used for drawing blood. Medical personnel who use reasonable care and accepted medical practices in withdrawing blood specimens are immune from liability for their actions in complying with requests made of them pursuant to this section.\n\n7. The person may have an independent chemical test or tests administered at the person’s own expense in addition to any administered at the direction of a peace officer. The failure or inability of the person to obtain an independent chemical test or tests does not preclude the admission of evidence of the results of the test or tests administered at the direction of the peace officer. Upon the request of the person who is tested, the results of the test or tests administered at the direction of the peace officer shall be made available to the person.\n\n8. In any prosecution under section 462A.14, evidence of the results of analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine is admissible upon proof of a proper foundation. The alcohol concentration established by the results of an analysis of a specimen of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine withdrawn within two hours after the defendant was operating or was otherwise in physical control of a motorboat or sailboat is presumed to be the alcohol concentration at the time of operation or being in physical control of the motorboat or sailboat. If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test, proof of refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was operating a motorboat or sailboat in violation of section 462A.14. This section does not limit the introduction of any competent evidence bearing on the question of whether a person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or a controlled substance or other drug, including the results of chemical tests of specimens of blood, breath, or urine obtained more than two hours after the person was operating a motorboat or sailboat.\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1099, §3; 2007 Acts, ch 28, §8\n\nReferred to in §462A.2, 462A.14, 462A.14B, 462A.14C, 462A.14D",

Refusal to consent to a test under section 462A.14A does not prohibit the withdrawal of a specimen for chemical testing pursuant to a search warrant issued in the investigation of a suspected violation of section 462A.14 if all of the following grounds exist:\n\na. An accident has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely to cause death.\n\nb. There are reasonable grounds to believe that one or more of the persons whose operation of a motorboat or sailboat may have been the proximate cause of the accident was violating section 462A.14 at the time of the accident.\n\n2. Search warrants may be issued under this section in full compliance with chapter 808 or search warrants may be issued under subsection 3.\n\n3. Notwithstanding section 808.3, the issuance of a search warrant under this section may be based upon sworn oral testimony communicated by telephone if the magistrate who is asked to issue the warrant is satisfied that the circumstances make it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit. The following shall then apply:\n\na. When a caller applies for the issuance of a warrant under this section and the magistrate becomes aware of the purpose of the call, the magistrate shall place under oath the person applying for the warrant.\n\nb. The person applying for the warrant shall prepare a duplicate warrant and read the duplicate warrant, verbatim, to the magistrate who shall enter, verbatim, what is read to the magistrate on a form that will be considered the original warrant. The magistrate may direct that the warrant be modified.\n\nc. The oral application testimony shall set forth facts and information tending to establish the existence of the grounds for the warrant and shall describe with a reasonable degree of specificity the person or persons whose operation of a motorboat or sailboat is believed to have been the proximate cause of the accident and from whom a specimen is to be withdrawn and the location where the withdrawal of the specimen or specimens is to take place.\n\nd. If a voice recording device is available, the magistrate may record by means of that device all of the call after the magistrate becomes aware of the purpose of the call. Otherwise, the magistrate shall cause a stenographic or longhand memorandum to be made of the oral testimony of the person applying for the warrant.\n\ne. If the magistrate is satisfied from the oral testimony that the grounds for the warrant exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, the magistrate shall order the issuance of the warrant by directing the person applying for the warrant to sign the magistrate’s name on the duplicate warrant. The magistrate shall immediately sign the original warrant and enter on its face the exact time when the issuance was ordered.\n\nf. The person who executes the warrant shall enter the time of execution on the face of the duplicate warrant.\n\ng. The magistrate shall cause any record of the call made by means of a voice recording device to be transcribed, shall certify the accuracy of the transcript, and shall file the transcript and the original record with the clerk. If a stenographic or longhand memorandum was made of the oral testimony of the person who applied for the warrant, the magistrate shall file a signed copy with the clerk.\n\nh. The clerk of court shall maintain the original and duplicate warrants along with the record of the telephone call and any transcript or memorandum made of the call in a confidential file until a charge, if any, is filed.\n\n4. a. Search warrants issued under this section shall authorize and direct peace officers to secure the withdrawal of blood specimens by medical personnel under section 462A.14A. Reasonable care shall be exercised to ensure the health and safety of the persons from whom specimens are withdrawn in execution of the warrants.\n\nb. If a person from whom a specimen is to be withdrawn objects to the withdrawal of blood, the warrant may be executed as follows:\n\n(1) If the person is capable of giving a specimen of breath, and a direct breath testing instrument is readily available, the warrant may be executed by the withdrawal of a specimen of breath for chemical testing, unless the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was under the influence of a controlled substance, a drug other than alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and another drug.\n\n(2) If the testimony in support of the warrant sets forth facts and information that the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was under the influence of a controlled substance, a drug other than alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and another drug, a urine sample shall be collected in lieu of a blood sample, if the person is capable of giving a urine sample and the sample can be collected without the need to physically compel the execution of the warrant.\n\n5. The act of any person knowingly resisting or obstructing the withdrawal of a specimen pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 462A.14D constitutes contempt punishable as provided in that section and further constitutes a refusal to submit. Also, if the withdrawal of a specimen is so resisted or obstructed, section 462A.14A applies.\n\n6. Nonsubstantive variances between the contents of the original and duplicate warrants shall not cause a warrant issued under subsection 3 to be considered invalid.\n\n7.
