The funds may be used to provide private landowners with cost-sharing assistance for habitat improvement practices on projects that are not eligible for federal programs or where federal funding for such projects is not adequate. The department may utilize the funds to provide marketing and outreach efforts to landowners in order to maximize landowners’ use of federal conservation programs. The department may coordinate such marketing and outreach efforts with soil and water conservation districts and other partners.\n\nc.

      "text": "483A.8 Deer hunting license and tag.\n\n1. A resident hunting deer who is required to have a hunting license must purchase a resident hunting license that includes the wildlife habitat fee, in addition to the deer hunting license. In addition, a resident who purchases a deer hunting license shall pay a one dollar fee that shall be used and is appropriated for the purpose of deer herd population management, including assisting with the cost of processing deer donated to the help us stop hunger program administered by the commission.\n\n2. a. The deer hunting license shall be accompanied by a tag designed to be used only once. When a deer is taken, the deer shall be tagged and the tag shall be dated. The tag shall be attached to the carcass of a deer taken within fifteen minutes of the time the deer carcass is located after being taken, or before the carcass is moved to be transported by any means from the place where the deer was taken, whichever occurs first. For each antlered deer taken, the tag shall be affixed to the deer’s antlers.\n\nb. For purposes of the tagging requirements in this subsection, a deer carcass may be moved away from an obstacle, entanglement, waterway, or any other area, including but not limited to a roadway, if tagging the carcass at that location would be a safety hazard to the hunter or a third person, before the tag is attached to the carcass. However, the carcass shall not be moved from the immediate vicinity of where the deer was taken, shall be moved only so far as is necessary to avoid the obstacle, entanglement, waterway, or other safety hazard, and shall be tagged immediately upon being so moved and before being moved to be transported.\n\n3. a. A nonresident hunting deer is required to purchase a nonresident annual hunting license that includes the wildlife habitat fee and a nonresident deer hunting license. In addition, a nonresident who purchases a deer hunting license shall pay a one dollar fee that shall be used and is appropriated for the purpose of deer herd population management, including assisting with the cost of processing deer donated to the help us stop hunger program administered by the commission.\n\nb. A nonresident who purchases an antlered or any sex deer hunting license pursuant to rules adopted pursuant to section 483A.1, is required to purchase an antlerless deer only deer hunting license at the same time, pursuant to rules adopted pursuant to section 483A.1.\n\nc. The commission shall annually limit to six thousand the number of nonresidents allowed to have antlered or any sex deer hunting licenses. Of the six thousand nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting licenses issued, not more than thirty-five percent of the licenses shall be bow season licenses. After the six thousand antlered or any sex nonresident deer hunting licenses have been issued, all additional licenses shall be issued for antlerless deer only. The commission shall annually determine the number of nonresident antlerless deer only deer hunting licenses that will be available for issuance.\n\nd. The commission shall allocate all nonresident deer hunting licenses issued among the zones based on the populations of deer. However, a nonresident applicant may request one or more hunting zones, in order of preference, in which the applicant wishes to hunt. If the request cannot be fulfilled, the applicable fees shall be returned to the applicant. A nonresident applying for a deer hunting license must exhibit proof of having successfully completed a hunter education program as provided in section 483A.27 or its equivalent as determined by the department before the license is issued.\n\ne. The commission shall assign one preference point to a nonresident whose application for a nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting license is denied due to limitations on the number of nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting licenses available for issuance that year. An additional preference point shall be assigned to that person each subsequent year the person’s license application is denied for that reason. A nonresident may purchase additional preference points pursuant to rules adopted pursuant to section 483A.1. The first nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting license drawing each year shall be made from the pool of applicants with the most preference points and continue to pools of applicants with successively fewer preference points until all available nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting licenses have been issued. If a nonresident applicant receives an antlered or any sex deer hunting license, all of the applicant’s assigned preference points at that time shall be removed.\n\n4. The commission may provide, by rule, for the issuance of an additional antlerless deer hunting license to a person who has been issued an antlerless deer hunting license. The rules shall specify the number of additional antlerless deer hunting licenses which may be issued, and the season and zone in which the license is valid. The fee for an additional antlerless deer hunting license shall be an amount established by rules adopted pursuant to section 483A.1 for residents.\n\n5. A nonresident owning land in this state may apply for a nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting license, and the provisions of subsection 3 shall apply. However, if a nonresident owning land in this state is unsuccessful in obtaining one of the nonresident antlered or any sex deer hunting licenses, the landowner shall be given preference for one of the antlerless deer only nonresident deer hunting licenses available pursuant to subsection 3. A nonresident owning land in this state shall pay the fee for a nonresident antlerless only deer hunting license and the license shall be valid to hunt on the nonresident’s land only. If one or more parcels of land have multiple nonresident owners, only one of the nonresident owners is eligible for a nonresident antlerless only deer hunting license. If a nonresident jointly owns land in this state with a resident, the nonresident shall not be given preference for a nonresident antlerless only deer hunting license. The department may require proof of land ownership from a nonresident landowner applying for a nonresident antlerless only deer hunting license.\n\n6. The commission shall provide by rule for the annual issuance to a nonresident of a nonresident antlerless deer hunting license that is valid for use only during the period beginning on December 24 and ending at sunset on January 2 of the following year and costs an amount established by rules adopted pursuant to section 483A.1. A nonresident hunting deer with a license issued under this subsection shall be otherwise qualified to hunt deer in this state and shall purchase a nonresident annual hunting license that includes the wildlife habitat fee, and pay the one dollar fee for the purpose of deer herd population management as provided in subsection 3. Pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall make available for issuance only the remaining nonresident antlerless deer hunting licenses allocated under subsection 3 that have not yet been issued for the current year’s nonresident antlerless deer hunting seasons.\n\n7. A person who is issued a youth deer hunting license may use the deer hunting license and tag during any established deer hunting season using the method of take authorized by rule for each season being hunted. If the tag is filled during one of the seasons, the license will not be valid in subsequent seasons.\n\n8. The commission shall adopt a rule permitting a resident to use a crossbow for taking deer during the late season that is designated for taking deer by muzzleloading rifle or muzzleloading pistol.\n\n9. There shall be a January antlerless deer only hunting season in a county whenever that county has unsold antlerless deer licenses available in its county quota as set by the commission by rule. The commission shall establish the season dates. Licenses shall be available for sale beginning the day after the close of the late muzzleloader season until either the county quota allotment has been sold or until the end of the season, whichever occurs first. A January antlerless deer only license issued under this subsection is valid only in the county identified on the license. A rifle with a barrel length of at least sixteen inches and firing centerfire ammunition propelling an expanding-type bullet with a maximum diameter of no less than two hundred twenty-three thousandths of one inch and no larger than five hundred thousandths of one inch and with a published or calculated muzzle energy of five hundred foot pounds or higher is the approved method of take for this season.\n\n[C79, 81, §110.8]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1240, §4; 89 Acts, ch 237, §3; 90 Acts, ch 1003, §2\n\nC93, §483A.8\n\n94 Acts, ch 1111, §2; 98 Acts, ch 1199, §10, 27; 98 Acts, ch 1203, §5 – 7; 98 Acts, ch 1223, §28 – 30; 2001 Acts, ch 134, §5; 2001 Acts, ch 148, §6, 7, 9; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §64; 2003 Acts, ch 85, §1; 2005 Acts, ch 139, §4; 2005 Acts, ch 179, §132; 2007 Acts, ch 129, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1158, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 144, §38; 2009 Acts, ch 179, §216, 217; 2011 Acts, ch 103, §1; 2012 Acts, ch 1096, §10 – 12, 23; 2014 Acts, ch 1100, §1; 2015 Acts, ch 26, §2; 2017 Acts, ch 48, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1159, §9, 17, 18, 28; 2022 Acts, ch 1137, §4\n\nReferred to in §483A.24, 805.8B(3)(c)\n\nFor applicable scheduled fine, see §805.8B, subsection 3, paragraph c\n\nSpecial licenses, see §483A.8B, 483A.8C, 483A.24",

The county attorney or attorney general may file with the clerk of the district court for the county in which the property was seized a notice of condemnation which shall include a description of the property claimed to be condemned by the state, the grounds upon which the state claims that the property has been condemned, the date and place of seizure, and the name of the person from whom the property was seized.\n\nb. The notice shall be filed not later than six months after the property was seized. Failure to file within the time limit terminates the state’s right to claim a condemnation of the property.\n\nc. The state shall give notice of condemnation to the person from whom the property was seized and any person identified as an owner or lien holder, by certified mail, personal service, or publication.\n\n3. a. The person from whom the property was seized may make application for its return in the office of the clerk of the district court for the county in which the property was seized. The application shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt of the notice of condemnation or the person is convicted of the violation for which the property was seized, whichever occurs later. Failure to file the application within this time period terminates the interest of the person and the ownership of the property shall be transferred to the state, except that a person who is not convicted of the violation for which the property was seized is not required to file an application and is entitled to the return of the property in accordance with section 483A.32.\n\nb. The application for return of condemnable property shall be written and shall state the specific item or items sought, the nature and the source of the claimant’s interest in the property, and the grounds upon which the claimant seeks to avoid condemnation. The ownership of property is not sufficient grounds for its return. The written application shall be specific and the claimant shall be limited at the judicial hearing to proof of the grounds set forth in the application for return. The fact that the property is inadmissible as evidence or that it may be suppressed is not grounds for its return. If specific grounds for return are not provided in the application for return, or the grounds are insufficient as a matter of law, the court may enter judgment on the pleadings without further hearing.\n\n4. If an application for return of condemnable property is timely and of sufficient grounds, the claim shall be set for hearing. The hearing shall be held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the claim is filed or the person is convicted for the violation for which the property was seized as a public nuisance, whichever occurs later. The proceeding shall be conducted by a magistrate or a district associate judge. All claims to the same property shall be heard in one proceeding unless it is shown that the proceeding would result in prejudice to one or more of the parties.\n\n5. a. Upon a finding by the court that the property is condemnable, the court shall enter an order transferring title of the property to the state, and placed at the disposal of the director, who may use or sell the property, depositing the proceeds of the sale in the state fish and game protection fund.\n\nb. Upon a finding by the court that the property should not be condemned, the property shall be returned to the person from whom it was seized. If the property is necessary for use as evidence in a criminal proceeding, the property shall not be returned until its use as evidence is no longer required.\n\nc. On or before December 31, 2018, and on or before December 1 each year thereafter, the department shall report to the general assembly’s standing committees on government oversight regarding the amount of the proceeds deposited to the state fish and game protection fund pursuant to this subsection. The report shall also contain all information recorded pursuant to paragraph “d”.\n\nd. A seizing public agency that has custody of any property that is seized pursuant to a provision of this subchapter shall adopt and comply with a written internal control policy that does all of the following:\n\n(1) Provides for keeping detailed records as to the amount of property acquired by the agency and the date property was acquired.\n\n(2) Provides for keeping detailed records of the disposition of the property, which shall include the manner in which the property was disposed, the date of disposition, and detailed financial records concerning any property sold. The records shall not identify or enable identification of the individual officer who seized any item of property or the name of any person or entity who received any item of property.\n\ne. The records kept under the internal control policy shall be open to public inspection during the agency’s regular business hours. The policy adopted under this section is a public record open for inspection under chapter 22.\n\n6. a. An employee of the seizing public agency or a member of the immediate family of the employee shall not purchase a fish, fur, bird, animal, mussel, clam, or frog seized pursuant to section 481A.12, a device, contrivance, or material condemned pursuant to section 483A.32, or a weapon seized pursuant to section 483A.32 and disposed of pursuant to this section or section 809.21. For purposes of this subsection, “member of the immediate family” means a spouse, child, stepchild, brother, brother-in-law, stepbrother, sister, sister-in-law, stepsister, parent, parent-in-law, or stepparent of an employee of the seizing public agency who resides in the same household in the same principal residence of the employee of the seizing public agency.\n\nb. The department shall provide a form on which a person purchasing property seized pursuant to section 481A.12 or 483A.32 shall declare that the person is not an employee of the seizing public agency or a member of the immediate family of an employee of the seizing public agency.\n\n7.

However, the commission shall not have a total principal amount of bonds outstanding at any time in excess of eight million dollars. The bonds shall be deemed to be investment securities and negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of chapter 554, the uniform commercial code.\n\n2. Bonds issued by the commission are payable solely and only from the revenues credited to the wildlife habitat bond fund. Taxes or appropriations shall not be pledged for the payment of the bonds. Bonds are not an obligation of this state or any political subdivision of this state other than the commission within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitations, but are special obligations of the commission payable solely and only from the sources provided in this subchapter, and the commission shall not pledge the general credit or taxing power of this state or any political subdivision of this state or make its debts payable out of any moneys except those of the wildlife habitat bond fund.\n\n3. Bonds must be authorized by a resolution of the commission. However, a resolution authorizing the issuance of obligations may delegate to an officer of the commission the power to negotiate and fix the details of an issue of bonds or notes by an appropriate certificate of the authorized officer.\n\n4. The bond proceedings shall provide for the purpose of the bonds, principal amount and principal maturity or maturities, the interest rate or rates or the maximum interest rate, the date of the bonds and the dates of payment of interest on the bonds, their denomination, the terms and conditions upon which parity bonds may be issued, and the establishment within or without the state of a place or places of payment of principal of and interest on the bonds. The purpose of the bonds may be stated in the bond proceedings in terms describing the general purpose or purposes to be served. The commission may cause to be issued a prospectus or official statement in connection with the offering of the bonds. Bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both. Provision may be made for the registration of bonds with coupons attached as to principal alone, or as to both principal and interest, their exchange for bonds so registered, and for the conversion or reconversion into bonds with coupons attached of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for reasonable charges for registration, exchange, conversion, and reconversion. Bonds shall be sold in the manner and at the time determined by the commission. Chapter 75 and sections 73A.12 through 73A.16 do not apply to these bonds. The bonds are negotiable instruments. The bond proceedings may contain additional provisions as to:\n\na. The redemption of bonds prior to maturity at the option of the commission at the price and on the terms and conditions provided in the bond proceedings.\n\nb. Other terms of the bonds and concerning execution and delivery of the bonds.\n\nc.

Payment from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds of all legal and financial expenses incurred by the commission in the issuance, sale, delivery, and payment of the bonds.\n\nf. Other matters, alike or different, which may in any way affect the security of the bonds and the protection of the bondholders.\n\n5. The power to issue bonds includes the power to issue obligations in the form of bond anticipation notes or other forms of short-term indebtedness and to renew these notes by the issuance of new notes. The holders of notes or interest coupons of notes have a right to be paid solely from those revenues credited to the wildlife habitat bond fund which were pledged to the payment of the bonds anticipated, or from the proceeds of those bonds or renewal notes, or both, as the commission provides in the bond proceedings authorizing the notes. The notes may be additionally secured by covenants of the commission to the effect that the commission will do those acts authorized by this subchapter and necessary for the issuance of the bonds or renewal notes in appropriate amount, and either exchange the bonds or renewal notes for the notes, or apply the proceeds of the notes, to the extent necessary, to make full payment of the principal of and interest on the notes at the time contemplated, as provided in the bond proceedings. For this purpose, the commission may issue bonds or renewal notes in a principal amount and upon terms as authorized by this subchapter and as necessary to provide funds to pay when required the principal of and interest on the outstanding notes. All provisions for and references to bonds in this subchapter are applicable to notes authorized under this subsection to the extent not inconsistent with this subsection.\n\n6. The commission may authorize and issue bonds for the refunding, including funding and retirement, and advance refunding with or without payment or redemption prior to maturity, of bonds previously issued by the commission. These bonds may be issued in amounts sufficient for payment of the principal amount of the prior bonds, any redemption premiums on the prior bonds, principal maturities of bonds maturing prior to the redemption of the remaining bonds on a parity with them, interest accrued or to accrue to the maturity date or dates of redemption of the bonds, and project costs including expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with this issuance, refunding, funding, and retirement. Subject to the bond proceedings, the portion of proceeds of the sale of bonds issued under this subsection to be applied to principal of and interest on the prior bonds shall be credited to the appropriate account for the prior bonds. Bonds authorized under this subsection shall be deemed to be issued for those purposes for which the prior bonds were issued and are subject to the provisions of this subchapter pertaining to other bonds.
