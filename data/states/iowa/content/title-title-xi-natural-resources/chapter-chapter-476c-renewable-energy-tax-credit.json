A tax credit certificate shall only be transferred once. However, for purposes of this transfer provision, a decision between a producer and purchaser of renewable energy regarding who claims the tax credit issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be considered a transfer and must be set forth in the application for the tax credit pursuant to section 476C.4. Within thirty days of transfer, the transferee must submit the transferred tax credit certificate to the department along with a statement containing the transferee’s name, tax identification number, and address, and the denomination that each new certificate is to carry and any other information required by the department. Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax credit certificate and the transferee’s statement, the department shall issue one or more replacement tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement tax credit certificate must contain the information required under section 476C.4, subsection 3, and must have the same effective taxable year and the same expiration date that appeared in the transferred tax credit certificate. Tax credit certificate amounts of less than the minimum amount established by rule shall not be transferable. A tax credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this chapter until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the transferee as the proper holder has been issued. The replacement tax credit certificate may reflect a different type of tax than the type of tax noted on the original tax credit certificate.\n\nb. The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit transferred against taxes imposed under chapter 422, subchapters II, III, and V, and chapter 432 for any tax year the original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. The transferee may claim a refund under chapter 423 or 437A for any tax year within the time period set forth in section 423.47 or 437A.14 for which the original transferor could have claimed the refund. Any consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall not be included as income under chapter 422, subchapters II, III, and V. Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422, subchapters II, III, and V.\n\n2. To claim a renewable energy tax credit under this chapter, a taxpayer must include one or more tax credit certificates with the taxpayer’s tax return, or if used against taxes imposed under chapter 423, the taxpayer shall comply with section 423.4, subsection 4, or if used against taxes imposed under chapter 437A, the taxpayer shall comply with section 437A.17B. A tax credit certificate shall not be used or included with a return filed for a taxable year beginning prior to July 1, 2006. The tax credit certificate or certificates included with the taxpayer’s tax return shall be issued in the taxpayer’s name, expire on or after the last day of the taxable year for which the taxpayer is claiming the tax credit, and show a tax credit amount equal to or greater than the tax credit claimed on the taxpayer’s tax return. Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable year may be credited to the taxpayer’s tax liability for the following seven tax years or until the credit is depleted, whichever is earlier. If the tax credit is applied against the taxes imposed under chapter 423 or 437A, any credit in excess of the taxpayer’s tax liability is carried over and can be filed with the refund claim for the following seven tax years or until depleted, whichever is earlier. However, the certificate shall not be used to reduce tax liability for a tax period ending after the expiration date of the certificate.\n\n3. The department shall develop a system for the registration of the renewable energy tax credit certificates issued or transferred under this chapter and a system that permits verification that any tax credit claimed on a tax return is valid and that transfers of the tax credit certificates are made in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
