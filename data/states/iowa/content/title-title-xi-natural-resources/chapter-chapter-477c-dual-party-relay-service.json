      "text": "477C.1 Dual party relay service — purpose.\n\nThe general assembly finds that the provision of a statewide dual party relay service will further the public interest and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of Iowa through an increase in the usefulness and availability of the telephone system. Many persons who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or have speech disorders are not able to utilize the telephone system without this type of service. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to enable the orderly development, operation, promotion, and funding of a statewide dual party relay service.\n\n91 Acts, ch 194, §1; 93 Acts, ch 75, §6; 96 Acts, ch 1129, §96; 2020 Acts, ch 1102, §28",
