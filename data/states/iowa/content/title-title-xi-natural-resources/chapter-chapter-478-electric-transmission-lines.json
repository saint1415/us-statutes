A person shall not construct, erect, maintain, or operate a transmission line, wire, or cable that is capable of operating at an electric voltage of sixty-nine kilovolts or more along, over, or across any public highway or grounds outside of cities for the transmission, distribution, or sale of electric current without first procuring from the utilities board a franchise granting authority as provided in this chapter.\n\n2. A franchise shall not be required for electric lines constructed entirely within the boundaries of property owned by a person primarily engaged in the transmission or distribution of electric power or entirely within the boundaries of property owned by the end user of the electric power.\n\n3. If the transmission line, wire, or cable is capable of operating only at an electric voltage of less than sixty-nine kilovolts, no franchise is required. However, the utilities board shall retain jurisdiction over all such lines, wires, or cables.\n\n4. A person who seeks to construct, erect, maintain, or operate a transmission line, wire, or cable that will operate at an electric voltage of less than sixty-nine kilovolts outside of cities and that cannot secure the necessary voluntary easements to do so may petition the board pursuant to section 478.3, subsection 1, for a franchise granting authority for such construction, erection, maintenance, or operation, and for the use of the right of eminent domain.\n\n5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an existing transmission line, wire, or cable is operating at thirty-four and one-half kilovolts, it may be franchised, rebuilt, and upgraded to be capable of operation at sixty-nine kilovolts using an abbreviated franchise process if the upgraded line will meet required safety standards, will be on substantially the same right-of-way, and will have substantially the same effect on the underlying properties. The abbreviated franchise process shall not require published notice or a public informational meeting. The board may adopt rules defining relevant terms, setting forth the steps of the abbreviated process, and specifying the requirements for the petition and landowner notification. The petitioner shall provide written notice concerning the anticipated construction to the last known address of the owners of record of the property where construction will occur and to the parties residing on such property. The franchise may be granted if the board finds the upgraded line is necessary to serve a public use and represents a reasonable relationship to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public interest. The franchise shall not become effective until the petitioner has paid, or agreed to pay, all costs and expenses of the franchise proceeding specified in section 478.4.\n\n[S13, §1527-c, 2120-n; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §8309; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, §489.1; C77, 79, 81, §478.1]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1101, §2; 94 Acts, ch 1136, §1; 97 Acts, ch 113, §1; 2002 Acts, ch 1048, §1, 5; 2009 Acts, ch 66, §1, 2; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §2688\n\nReferred to in §478.31\n\nAuthorization in cities, §364.2\n\nSubsection 1 amended",

As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Electric transmission line” means a high-voltage electric transmission line with a capacity of one hundred kilovolts or more and any associated electric transmission facility, including any substation or other equipment.\n\nb. “Electric transmission owner” means an individual or entity who, as of July 1, 2020, owns and maintains an electric transmission line that is required for rate-regulated electric utilities, municipal electric utilities, and rural electric cooperatives in this state to provide electric service to the public for compensation.\n\nc. “Incumbent electric transmission owner” means any of the following:\n\n(1) A public utility or a municipally owned utility that owns, operates, and maintains an electric transmission line in this state.\n\n(2) An electric cooperative corporation or association or municipally owned utility that owns an electric transmission facility in this state and has turned over the functional control of such facility to a federally approved authority.\n\n(3) An “electric transmission owner” as defined in paragraph “b”.\n\nd. “Landowner” means the same as defined in section 478.2.\n\ne. “Municipally owned utility” means a “city utility” as defined in section 362.2, or an “electric power agency” as defined in section 390.9 which is comprised solely of cities or solely of cities and other political subdivisions.\n\n2. An incumbent electric transmission owner has the right to construct, own, and maintain an electric transmission line that has been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority transmission plan and which connects to an electric transmission facility owned by the incumbent electric transmission owner. Where a proposed electric transmission line would connect to electric transmission facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission owners, each incumbent electric transmission owner whose facility connects to the electric transmission line has the right to construct, own, and maintain the electric transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that would connect to electric transmission facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission owners, then the other incumbent electric transmission owner or owners that own an electric transmission facility to which the electric transmission line connects has the right to construct, own, and maintain the electric transmission line individually.\n\n3. If an electric transmission line has been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority transmission plan, and the electric transmission line is not subject to a right of first refusal in accordance with the tariff of a federally registered planning authority, then within ninety days of approval for construction, an incumbent electric transmission owner, or owners if there is more than one owner, that owns a connecting electric transmission facility shall give written notice to the board regarding whether the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners intend to construct, own, and maintain the electric transmission line. If the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners give notice of intent to construct the electric transmission line, the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners shall follow the applicable franchise requirements pursuant to this chapter. If the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners give notice declining to construct the electric transmission line, the board may determine whether another person may construct the electric transmission line.\n\n4. For projects where an election to construct an electric transmission line has been made under this section, all of the following cost accountability measures shall apply:\n\na. Within thirty days after the issuance of a franchise pursuant to this chapter for the electric transmission line, the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners shall provide to the board an estimate of the cost to construct the electric transmission line.\n\nb. Until construction of the electric transmission line is complete, the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners shall provide a quarterly report to the board, which shall include an updated estimate of the cost to construct the electric transmission line and an explanation of changes in the cost estimate from the prior cost estimate.\n\n5. This section shall not modify the authority of the board under this chapter, the rights of landowners under this chapter, or the requirements, rights, and obligations relating to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric transmission lines pursuant to this chapter.\n\n6. This section shall not apply to an electric transmission line to be placed underground that has not been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority transmission plan.\n\n7.

The person, company, or corporation shall first file with the board a verified petition setting forth the requirements of section 478.3, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” through “h”, with the further allegation that the petitioner is the nearest electric utility to the proposed point of service.\n\n2. The petition shall also state that the filing thereof constitutes an application for a temporary construction permit and shall also have endorsed thereon the approval of the appropriate highway authority or railroad concerned if such line is to be constructed over, across, or along a public highway or railroad.\n\n3. Upon receipt of the petition, the utilities board shall consider same and may grant a temporary construction permit in whole or in part or upon such terms, conditions, and restrictions, and with such modifications as to location as may seem to it just and proper. A finding of public use shall not be made at the time of the issuance of the permit, but shall be made, if substantiated by petitioner, at the subsequent consideration of the propriety of granting a franchise for the line subject to the permit. The signature of one utilities board member on the permit shall be sufficient. The issuance of the permit shall constitute temporary authority for the permit holder to construct the line for which the permit is granted.\n\n4. Upon the granting of such temporary construction permit, the utilities board shall cause the publication of notice required by section 478.5 and all other requirements shall be complied with as in the manner provided for the granting of a franchise. If a hearing is required, then the petitioner shall make a sufficient and proper showing thereat before a franchise will be issued for the line. Any franchise issued will be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter.\n\n5. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 4, if the utilities board shall determine that a franchise should not be granted, or that further restrictions, conditions, or modifications are required, or if the petitioner shall fail to make a sufficient and proper showing of the necessity for the granting of a franchise within six months of the granting of the temporary construction permit, the permit issued hereunder shall become null and void and the permit holder may be required to take such action deemed necessary by the board to remove, modify, or relocate the construction undertaken by virtue of the temporary permit issued hereunder.\n\n[C66, 71, 73, 75, §489.31; C77, 79, 81, §478.31]\n\n2015 Acts, ch 30, §156",
