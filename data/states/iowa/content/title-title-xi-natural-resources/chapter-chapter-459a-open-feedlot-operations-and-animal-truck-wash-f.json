Prior to constructing a settled open feedlot effluent basin or an unformed animal truck wash effluent structure, the site for the basin or structure shall be investigated for a drainage tile line by the owner of the open feedlot operation or animal truck wash facility. The investigation shall be made by digging a core trench to a depth of at least six feet deep from ground level at the projected center of the berm of the basin or unformed structure. If a drainage tile line is discovered, one of the following solutions shall be implemented:\n\n(1) The drainage tile line shall be rerouted around the perimeter of the basin or unformed animal truck wash effluent structure at a distance of at least twenty-five feet horizontally separated from the outside edge of the berm of the basin or unformed structure. For an area of the basin or unformed structure where there is not a berm, the drainage tile line shall be rerouted at least fifty feet horizontally separated from the edge of the basin or unformed structure.\n\n(2) The drainage tile line shall be replaced with a nonperforated tile line under the floor of the basin or unformed animal truck wash effluent structure. The nonperforated tile line shall be continuous and without connecting joints. There must be a minimum of three feet between the nonperforated tile line and the floor of the basin or unformed structure.\n\nb. A written record of the investigation shall be submitted as part of the construction certification required under section 459A.207.\n\n2. a. The settled open feedlot effluent basin or unformed animal truck wash effluent structure shall be constructed with a minimum separation of two feet between the top of the liner of the basin or unformed structure and the seasonal high-water table.\n\nb. If a drainage tile line around the perimeter of the settled open feedlot effluent basin or unformed animal truck wash effluent structure is installed a minimum of two feet below the top of the basin’s or unformed structure’s liner to artificially lower the seasonal high-water table, the top of the liner may be a maximum of four feet below the seasonal high-water table. The seasonal high-water table may be artificially lowered by gravity flow tile lines or other similar system. However, the following shall apply:\n\n(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2), an open feedlot operation or animal truck wash facility shall not use a nongravity mechanical system that uses pumping equipment.\n\n(2) If the open feedlot operation was constructed before July 1, 2005, the operation may continue to use its existing nongravity mechanical system that uses pumping equipment or it may construct a new nongravity mechanical system that uses pumping equipment. However, an open feedlot operation that expands the area of its open feedlot on or after April 1, 2011, shall not use a nongravity mechanical system that uses pumping equipment.\n\n3. Drainage tile lines may be installed to artificially lower the seasonal high-water table at a settled open feedlot effluent basin or an unformed animal truck wash effluent structure, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\na. A device to allow monitoring of the water in the drainage tile lines and a device to allow shutoff of the flow in the drainage tile lines are installed, if the drainage tile lines do not have a surface outlet accessible on the property where the basin or unformed structure is located.\n\nb. Drainage tile lines are installed horizontally at least twenty-five feet away from the basin or unformed structure. Drainage tile lines shall be placed in a vertical trench and encased in granular material which extends upward to the level of the seasonal high-water table.\n\n4. A settled open feedlot effluent basin or an unformed animal truck wash effluent structure shall be constructed with at least four feet between the bottom of the basin or unformed structure and a bedrock formation.\n\n5. A settled open feedlot effluent basin or an unformed animal truck wash effluent structure constructed on a floodplain or within a floodway of a river or stream shall comply with rules adopted by the commission.\n\n6. The liner of a settled open feedlot effluent basin or unformed animal truck wash effluent structure shall comply with all of the following:\n\na. The liner shall comply with any of the following permeability standards:\n\n(1) The liner shall be constructed to have a percolation rate that shall not exceed one-sixteenth inch per day at the design depth of the basin as determined by percolation tests conducted by the professional engineer. If a clay soil liner is used, the liner shall be constructed with a minimum thickness of twelve inches or the minimum thickness necessary to comply with the percolation rate in this section, whichever is greater.\n\n(2) The liner shall be constructed at optimum moisture content not less than ninety-five percent of the maximum density as determined by a standard five-point proctor test performed at the site of the open feedlot operation by a professional engineer. If a clay soil liner is used, the liner shall be constructed with a minimum thickness of twelve inches.\n\nb. If a synthetic liner is used, the liner shall be installed to comply with the percolation rate required in this section.\n\n7. The owner of an open feedlot operation using a settled open feedlot effluent basin or animal truck wash facility using an unformed animal truck wash effluent structure shall inspect the berms of the basin or unformed structure at least semiannually for evidence of erosion. If the inspection reveals erosion which may impact the basin’s or unformed structure’s structural stability or the integrity of the basin’s or unformed structure’s liner, the owner shall repair the berms.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 136, §12; 2015 Acts, ch 92, §32 – 36; 2015 Acts, ch 138, §42, 43, 63 – 68, 161, 162\n\nReferred to in §459A.103, 459A.303",

All settleable solids from open feedlot effluent shall be removed prior to discharge into a water of the state.\n\na. The settleable solids shall be removed by use of a solids settling facility. The construction of a solids settling facility is not required where existing site conditions provide for removal of settleable solids prior to discharge into a water of the state.\n\nb. The removal of settleable solids shall be deemed to have occurred when the velocity of flow of the open feedlot effluent has been reduced to less than point five feet per second for a minimum of five minutes. A solids settling facility shall have sufficient capacity to store settled solids between periods of land application and to provide required flow-velocity reduction for open feedlot effluent flow volumes resulting from a precipitation event of less intensity than a ten-year, one-hour frequency event. A solids settling facility which receives open feedlot effluent shall provide a minimum of one square foot of surface area for each eight cubic feet of open feedlot effluent per hour resulting from a ten-year, one-hour frequency precipitation event.\n\n2. Notwithstanding subsection 1, an open feedlot operation that is a concentrated animal feeding operation shall comply with applicable NPDES permit requirements as provided in the federal Water Pollution Control Act, pursuant to rules that shall be adopted by the commission. Any rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be no more stringent than requirements under the federal Act.\n\n3. If the open feedlot operation is designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with the requirements of an open feedlot effluent control system as provided in rules adopted by the commission, the operation shall be deemed to be in compliance with this section, unless a discharge from the operation causes a violation of state water quality standards as provided in chapter 455B, subchapter III.\n\n4. The following shall apply to an open feedlot operation which has an animal unit capacity of one thousand animal units or more:\n\na. (1) The open feedlot operation shall not discharge open feedlot effluent from an open feedlot operation structure into any waters of the United States, unless the discharge is pursuant to an NPDES permit.\n\n(2) The open feedlot operation shall not be required to be issued an NPDES permit if the operation does not discharge open feedlot effluent into any waters of the United States.\n\nb. The control of open feedlot effluent originating from the open feedlot operation may be accomplished by the use of a solids settling facility, settled open feedlot effluent basin, alternative technology system, or any other open feedlot effluent control structure or practice approved by the department. The department may require the diversion of surface drainage prior to contact with an open feedlot operation structure.
