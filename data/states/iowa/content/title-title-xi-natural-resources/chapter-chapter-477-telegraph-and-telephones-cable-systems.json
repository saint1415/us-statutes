Notwithstanding section 477.7, when services are deregulated by the board under section 476.1D, a telegraph or telephone company, in any contract, agreement, or by means of public notice, may reasonably limit its liability under section 477.7 in the course of providing the deregulated communications services to its customers, except for acts of willful misconduct.
