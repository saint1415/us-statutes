Upon expiration of a franchise, a person may choose to renegotiate a franchise agreement with a municipality or may choose to obtain a certificate of franchise authority under this chapter. An application for a certificate of franchise authority pursuant to this subsection may be filed within sixty days prior to the expiration of a municipal franchise agreement. A certificate of franchise authority obtained pursuant to an application filed prior to the expiration of a municipal franchise agreement shall take effect upon the expiration date of the municipal franchise agreement.\n\nc.

If a competitive cable service provider or a competitive video service provider applies for a certificate of franchise authority to operate within a municipality, the incumbent cable provider may, at its discretion, apply for a certificate of franchise authority for that same municipality. Such application shall be automatically granted on the same day as a competitive cable service provider or competitive video service provider files a thirty days’ notice of offering service as required pursuant to subsection 4. The franchise agreement with the municipality is terminated on the date the board issues the certificate of franchise authority to an incumbent cable provider. The terms and conditions of the certificate of franchise authority shall be the same as the terms and conditions of a competitive cable service provider or a competitive video service provider pursuant to this chapter and shall replace the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement previously granted by the municipality.\n\n2007 Acts, ch 201, §3, 15; 2008 Acts, ch 1062, §2; 2010 Acts, ch 1126, §1, 3\n\nReferred to in §477A.3, 477A.7, 714H.4",
