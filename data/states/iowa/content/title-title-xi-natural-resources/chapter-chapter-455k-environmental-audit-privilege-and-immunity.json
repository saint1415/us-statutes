Material included in an environmental audit report generated during an environmental audit conducted after July 1, 1998, is privileged and confidential and is not discoverable or admissible as evidence in any civil or administrative proceeding, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The environmental audit report shall be labeled “ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT REPORT: PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT”. Failure to label each document within the report does not constitute a waiver of the environmental audit privilege or create a presumption that the privilege does or does not apply.\n\n2. A person shall not be compelled to testify in regard to or produce a document included in an environmental audit report in any of the following circumstances:\n\na. If the testimony or document discloses any component listed in section 455K.2, subsection 3, that was made as part of the preparation of an environmental audit report and that is addressed in a privileged part of an environmental audit report.\n\nb. If the person is any of the following:\n\n(1) A person who conducted any portion of the environmental audit but did not personally observe the physical events of an environmental violation.\n\n(2) A person to whom the results of the environmental audit report are disclosed under section 455K.4, subsection 2.\n\n(3) A custodian of the environmental audit report.\n\n3. A person who conducts or participates in the preparation of an environmental audit report and who has observed physical events of an environmental violation may testify about those events but shall not be compelled to testify about or produce documents related to the preparation of or any privileged part of an environmental audit or any component listed in section 455K.2, subsection 3.\n\n4. An employee of a state agency or other governmental employee shall not request, review, or otherwise use an environmental audit report during an agency inspection of a regulated facility or operation, or an activity of a regulated facility or operation.\n\n5.

Disclosure of an environmental audit report or any other information generated by an environmental audit does not waive the privilege established in section 455K.3 if the disclosure meets any of the following criteria:\n\na. The disclosure is made to address or correct a matter raised by the environmental audit and the disclosure is made to any of the following:\n\n(1) A person employed by the owner or operator, including temporary and contract employees.\n\n(2) A legal representative of the owner or operator.\n\n(3) An officer or director of the regulated facility or operation or a partner of the owner or operator.\n\n(4) An independent contractor retained by the owner or operator.\n\nb.

The portion of the environmental audit report shows clear and convincing evidence of substantial actual personal injury, which information is not otherwise available.\n\ne. The portion of the environmental audit report shows a clear and present danger to the public health or the environment.\n\n2.

If information is required to be made available to the public by operation of a specific state or federal law, rule, or permit condition, the governmental authority shall notify the person claiming the privilege of the potential for public disclosure prior to obtaining such information under subsection 1 or 2.\n\n4. If privileged information is disclosed under subsection 2 or 3, on the motion of a party, a court or the presiding officer in an administrative hearing shall suppress evidence offered in any civil or administrative proceeding that arises or is derived from review, disclosure, or use of information obtained under this section if the review, disclosure, or use is not authorized under section 455K.6.

      "text": "455K.8 Voluntary disclosure of environmental violation — immunity.\n\n1. An owner or operator is eligible for immunity under this section from the time the department receives official notification from the owner or operator of a scheduled environmental audit. An owner or operator is immune from any administrative or civil penalty associated with the information disclosed if the owner or operator makes a prompt voluntary disclosure to the department regarding an environmental violation which is discovered through the environmental audit. The owner or operator creates a rebuttable presumption that the disclosure is voluntary by meeting the criteria provided in subsection 2 at the time of disclosure. To rebut the presumption that a disclosure is voluntary, the department or other party has the burden of proving that the disclosure was not voluntary. Immunity is not provided if the violations of state or federal environmental law, rule, or permit condition are intentional or if the violations of state or federal law, rule, or permit condition resulted in substantial actual injury or imminent and substantial risk of injury to persons, property, or the environment.\n\n2. The disclosure of information is voluntary if all of the following circumstances exist:\n\na. The disclosure arises out of an environmental audit and relates to privileged information as provided in section 455K.3.\n\nb. The person making the disclosure uses reasonable efforts to pursue compliance and to correct the noncompliance within a reasonable period of time after completion of the environmental audit in accordance with a remediation schedule submitted to and approved by the department. If evidence shows that the noncompliance is due to the failure to obtain a permit, reasonable effort may be demonstrated by the submittal of a complete permit application within a reasonable time. Disclosure of information required to be reported by state or federal law, rule, or permit condition is not considered to be voluntary disclosure and the immunity provisions in this section are not applicable.\n\nc. Environmental violations are identified in an environmental audit report and disclosed to the department before there is notice of a citizen suit or a legal complaint by a third party.\n\nd. Environmental violations are identified in an environmental audit report and disclosed to the department before the environmental violations are reported by any person not involved in conducting the environmental audit or to whom the environmental audit report was disclosed.\n\n3. If an owner or operator has not provided the department with notification of a scheduled environmental audit prior to performing the audit, a disclosure of information is voluntary if the environmental violations are identified in an environmental audit report and disclosed by certified mail to the proper regulatory agency that has jurisdiction over the disclosed violation prior to the agency’s commencement of an investigation.\n\n4. If a person is required to make a disclosure relating to a specific issue under a specific permit condition or under an order issued by the department, the disclosure is not voluntary with respect to that issue.\n\n5. Except as provided in this section, this section does not impair the authority of the proper regulatory agency to require a technical or remedial action or to order injunctive relief.\n\n6. Upon application to the department, the time period within which the disclosed violation is corrected under subsection 2 may be extended if it is not practical to correct the noncompliance within the reasonable period of time initially approved by the department. The department shall not unreasonably withhold the grant of an extension. If the department denies an extension, the department shall provide the requesting party with a written explanation of the reasons for the denial. A request for de novo review of the department’s decision may be made to the appropriate court.\n\n7. Immunity provided under this section from administrative or civil penalties does not apply under any of the following circumstances:\n\na. If an owner or operator of the facility or operation has been found in a civil or administrative proceeding to have committed serious violations in this state that constitute a pattern of continuous or repeated violations of environmental laws, administrative rules, and permit conditions and that were due to separate and distinct events giving rise to the violations within the three-year period prior to the date of disclosure, or if under section 459.604 an owner or operator of a facility or operation is classified as a habitual violator.\n\nb. If a violation of an environmental law, administrative rule, permit condition, settlement agreement, or order on consent, final order, or judicial order results in a substantial economic benefit which gives the violator a clear advantage over its business competitors.\n\n8. In cases where the conditions of a voluntary disclosure are not met but a good faith effort was made to voluntarily disclose and resolve a violation detected in an environmental audit, the state regulatory authorities shall consider the nature and extent of any good faith effort in deciding the appropriate enforcement response and shall consider reducing any administrative or civil penalties based on mitigating factors showing that one or more of the conditions for voluntary disclosure have been met.\n\n9. The immunity provided by this section does not abrogate the responsibility of a person as provided by applicable law to report a violation, to correct the violation, conduct necessary remediation, or respond to third-party actions. This chapter shall not be construed to confer immunity from liability in any private civil action except those actions brought pursuant to section 455B.111.\n\n10. Information required by rule to be submitted to the department as part of a disclosure made pursuant to this section is not privileged information.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1109, §8",
