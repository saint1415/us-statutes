In determining whether a service or facility is or becomes subject to effective competition, the board shall consider, among other factors, whether a comparable service or facility is available from a supplier other than the telephone utility in the geographic market being considered by the board and whether market forces in that market are sufficient to assure just and reasonable rates without regulation.\n\nb.

A public utility subject to rate regulation shall not make effective a new or changed rate, charge, schedule, or regulation until the rate, charge, schedule, or regulation has been approved by the board, except as provided in subsections 8 and 9.\n\n2. Written notice of increase. All public utilities, except those exempted from rate regulation by section 476.1 and telecommunications service providers registered pursuant to section 476.95A, shall give written notice of a proposed increase of any rate or charge to all affected customers served by the public utility no more than thirty days prior to the time the application for the increase is filed with the board. Public utilities exempted from rate regulation by section 476.1, except telecommunications service providers registered pursuant to section 476.95A, shall give written notice of a proposed increase of any rate or charge to all affected customers served by the public utility at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the increase. If the public utility is subject to rate regulation, the written notice to affected customers shall include an estimate of the total bill impact on a typical customer in each affected customer class, provide a general explanation of the board’s rate increase review process, and state that the customer has a right to file a written objection to the rate increase and that the affected customers may request the board to hold a public hearing to determine if the rate increase should be allowed. The written notice to each affected customer of the public utility shall be served in the manner in which the customer elects to receive bills and other communications from the public utility.\n\n3. Facts and arguments submitted. At the time a public utility subject to rate regulation files with the board an application for any new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations, the public utility also shall submit factual evidence and written argument offered in support of the filing. If the filing is an application for a general rate increase, the utility shall also file affidavits containing testimonial evidence to be offered in support of the filing, although this requirement does not apply if the public utility is a rural electric cooperative.\n\n4. Hearing set. After the filing of an application for new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations by a public utility subject to rate regulation, the board, prior to the expiration of thirty days after the filing date, shall docket the case as a formal proceeding and set the case for hearing unless the new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations are approved by the board. However, if an application presents no material issue of fact subject to dispute, and the board determines that the application violates a relevant statute, or is not in substantial compliance with a board rule lawfully adopted pursuant to chapter 17A, the application may be rejected by the board without prejudice and without a hearing, provided that the board issues a written order setting forth all of its reasons for rejecting the application. In the case of a gas public utility having less than two thousand customers, the board shall docket a case as a formal proceeding and set the case for hearing as provided in section 476.1C. In the case of a rural electric cooperative, the board may docket the case as a formal proceeding and set the case for hearing prior to the proposed effective date of the tariff. The board shall give notice of formal proceedings as it deems appropriate. The docketing of a case as a formal proceeding suspends the effective date of the new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations until the rates, charges, schedules, or regulations are approved by the board, except as provided in subsection 9.\n\n5. Utility hearing expenses reported. When a case has been docketed as a formal proceeding under subsection 4, the public utility, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall file with the board a report outlining the utility’s expected expenses for litigating the case through the time period allowed by the board in rendering a decision. At the conclusion of the utility’s presentation of comments, testimony, exhibits, or briefs the utility shall submit to the board a listing of the utility’s actual litigation expenses in the proceeding. As part of the findings of the board under subsection 6, the board shall allow recovery of costs of the litigation expenses over a reasonable period of time to the extent the board deems the expenses reasonable and just.\n\n6. Finding by board. If, after hearing and decision on all issues presented for determination in the rate proceeding, the board finds the proposed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations of the utility to be unlawful, the board shall by order authorize and direct the utility to file new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations which, when approved by the board and placed in effect, will satisfy the requirements of this chapter. The rates, charges, schedules, or regulations so approved are lawful and effective upon their approval.\n\n7. Limitation on filings. A public utility shall not make a subsequent filing of an application for a new or changed rate, charge, schedule, or regulation which relates to services for which a rate filing is pending within twelve months following the date the prior application was filed or until the board has issued a final order on the prior application, whichever date is earlier, unless the public utility applies to the board for authority and receives authority to make a subsequent filing at an earlier date.\n\n8. Automatic adjustments.\n\na. This chapter does not prohibit a public utility from making provision for the automatic adjustment of rates and charges for public utility service provided that a schedule showing the automatic adjustment of rates and charges is first filed with and approved by the board.\n\nb. A public utility may automatically adjust rates and charges to recover costs related to transmission incurred by or charged to the public utility consistent with a tariff or agreement that is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission, provided that a schedule showing the automatic adjustment of rates and charges is first filed with and approved by the board. The board shall adopt rules regarding the reporting of transmission expenses and transmission-related activity pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n9. Temporary authority.\n\na. A public utility may choose to place in effect temporary rates, charges, schedules, or regulations without board review on or after ten days following the filing date under this section. If the utility chooses to place such rates, charges, schedules, or regulations in effect, the utility shall file with the board a bond or other corporate undertaking approved by the board conditioned upon the refund in a manner prescribed by the board of amounts collected in excess of the amounts which would have been collected under rates, charges, schedules, or regulations finally approved by the board. At the conclusion of the proceeding if the board determines that the temporary rates, charges, schedules, or regulations placed in effect under this paragraph were not based on previously established regulatory principles, the board shall consider ordering refunds based upon the overpayments made by each individual customer class, rate zone, or customer group. If the board has not rendered a final decision with respect to suspended rates, charges, schedules, or regulations upon the expiration of ten months after the filing date, plus the length of any delay that necessarily results either from the failure of the public utility to exercise due diligence in connection with the proceedings or from intervening judicial proceedings, plus the length of any extension permitted by section 476.33, subsection 3, then such temporary rates, charges, schedules, or regulations placed into effect on a temporary basis shall be deemed finally approved by the board and the utility may place them into effect on a permanent basis.\n\nb. If the board finds that an extension of the ten-month period is necessary to permit the accumulation of necessary data with respect to the operation of a newly constructed electric generating facility that has a capacity of one hundred megawatts or more of electricity and that is proposed to be included in the rate base for the first time, the board may extend the ten-month period up to a maximum extension of six months, but only with respect to that portion of the suspended rates, charges, schedules, or regulations that are necessarily connected with the inclusion of the generating facility in the rate base. If a utility is proposing to include in its rate base for the first time a newly constructed electric generating facility that has a capacity of one hundred megawatts or more of electricity, the filing date of new or changed rates, charges, schedules, or regulations shall, for purposes of computing the time limitations stated above, be the date as determined by the board that the new plant went into service, but only with respect to that portion of the suspended rates, charges, schedules, or regulations that are necessarily connected with the inclusion of the generating facility in the rate base.\n\nc. The board shall determine the rate of interest to be paid by a public utility to persons receiving refunds. The interest rate to be applied to refunds of moneys collected subject to refund under this subsection is two percent per annum plus the average quarterly interest rate at commercial banks for twenty-four-month loans for personal expenditures, as determined by the board, compounded annually. The board shall consider federal reserve statistical release G.19 or its equivalent when determining interest to be paid under this subsection.\n\n10. Refunds passed on to customers. If pursuant to federal law or rule a rate-regulated public utility furnishing gas to customers in the state receives a refund or credit for past gas purchases, the savings shall be passed on to the customers in a manner approved by the board. Similarly, if pursuant to federal law or rule a rate-regulated public utility furnishing gas to customers in the state receives a rate for future gas purchases which is lower than the price included in the public utility’s approved rate application, the savings shall be passed on to the customers in a manner approved by the board.\n\n11. Natural gas supply and cost review.\n\na. The board shall periodically conduct a proceeding for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of a rate-regulated public utility’s natural gas procurement and contracting practices. The natural gas supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\nb. Under procedures established by the board, each rate-regulated public utility furnishing gas shall periodically file a complete natural gas procurement plan describing the expected sources and volumes of its gas supply and changes in the cost of gas anticipated over a future twelve-month period specified by the board. The utilities shall file information as the board deems appropriate.\n\nc. During the natural gas supply and cost review, the board shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the gas procurement plan. If a utility is not taking all reasonable actions to minimize its purchase gas costs, consistent with assuring an adequate long-term supply of natural gas, the board shall not allow the utility to recover from its customers purchase gas costs in excess of those costs that would be incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.\n\n12. Electric energy supply and cost review. The board shall periodically conduct a proceeding for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of a rate-regulated public utility’s procurement and contracting practices related to the acquisition of fuel for use in generating electricity. The evaluation may review the reasonableness and prudence of actions taken by a rate-regulated public utility to comply with the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549. The proceeding shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 17A. Under procedures established by the board, the utility shall file information as the board deems appropriate. If a utility is not taking all reasonable actions to minimize its fuel and allowance transaction costs, the board shall not allow the utility to recover from its customers fuel and allowance transaction costs in excess of those costs that would be or would have been incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.\n\n13. Energy efficiency plans. Electric and gas public utilities shall offer energy efficiency programs to their customers through energy efficiency plans. An energy efficiency plan as a whole shall be cost-effective. In determining the cost-effectiveness of an energy efficiency plan, the board shall apply the societal test, total resource cost test, utility cost test, rate-payer impact test, and participant test. Energy efficiency programs for qualified low-income persons and for tree planting programs, educational programs, and assessments of consumers’ needs for information to make effective choices regarding energy use and energy efficiency need not be cost-effective and shall not be considered in determining cost-effectiveness of plans as a whole. The energy efficiency programs in the plans may be provided by the utility or by a contractor or agent of the utility. Programs offered pursuant to this subsection by gas and electric utilities that are required to be rate-regulated shall require board approval.\n\n14. Water costs for fire protection in certain cities.\n\na. Application. A city furnished water by a public utility subject to rate regulation may apply to the board for inclusion of all or a part of the costs of fire hydrants or other improvements, maintenance, and operations for the purpose of providing adequate water production, storage, and distribution for public fire protection in the rates or charges assessed to consumers covered by the applicant’s fire protection service. The application shall be made in a form and manner approved by or as directed by the board. The applicant shall provide such additional information as the board may require to consider the application.\n\nb. Review. The board shall review the application, and may in its discretion consider additional evidence, beyond that supplied in the application or provided by the applicant in response to a request for additional information pursuant to paragraph “a”, including but not limited to soliciting oral or written testimony from other interested parties.\n\nc. Notice. Written notice of a proposed rate increase shall be provided by the public utility pursuant to subsection 2, except that notice shall be provided within ninety days of the date of application. Costs of the notice shall be paid for by the applicant.\n\nd. Conditions for approval. As a condition to approving an application to include water-related fire protection costs in the utility’s rates or charges, the board shall make an affirmative determination that the following conditions will be met:\n\n(1) That the service area currently charged for fire protection, either directly or indirectly, is substantially the same service area containing those persons who will pay for water-related fire protection through inclusion of such costs within the utility’s rates or charges.\n\n(2) That the inclusion of such costs within the utility’s rates or charges will not cause substantial inequities among the utility’s customers.\n\n(3) That all or a portion of the costs sought to be included in the utility’s rates or charges by the applicant are reasonable in the circumstances, and limited to the purposes specified in paragraph “a”.\n\n(4) That written notice has been provided pursuant to paragraph “c” and that the costs of the notice have been paid by the applicant.\n\ne. Inclusion within rates or charges. If the board affirmatively determines that the conditions of paragraph “d” are or will be satisfied, the board shall include the reasonable costs in the rates or charges assessed to consumers covered by the applicant’s fire protection service.\n\nf. Written order. The board shall issue a written order within six months of the date of application. The written order shall include a recitation of the facts found pursuant to consideration of the application.\n\n15. Energy efficiency implementation, cost review, and cost recovery.\n\na. (1) (a) Electric utilities required to be rate-regulated under this chapter shall file five-year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans with the board. Gas utilities required to be rate-regulated under this chapter shall file five-year energy efficiency plans with the board. An energy efficiency plan and budget or a demand response plan and budget shall include a range of energy efficiency or demand response programs, tailored to the needs of all customer classes, including residential, commercial, and industrial customers, for energy efficiency opportunities. The plans shall include programs for qualified low-income persons including a cooperative program with any community action agency within the utility’s service area to implement countywide or communitywide energy efficiency programs for qualified low-income persons. Rate-regulated gas and electric utilities shall utilize Iowa agencies and Iowa contractors to the maximum extent cost-effective in their energy efficiency plans or demand response plans filed with the board.\n\n(b) The board shall allow a customer of an electric utility that is required to be rate-regulated to request an exemption from participation in any five-year energy efficiency plan offered by an electric utility if the energy efficiency plan and demand response plan, at the time of approval by the board, have a cumulative rate-payer impact test result of less than one. Upon receipt of a request for exemption submitted by a customer, the electric utility shall grant the exemption and, beginning January 1 of the following year, the customer shall no longer be assessed the costs of the plan and shall be prohibited from participating in any program included in such plan until the exemption no longer applies, as determined by the board.\n\n(2) Gas and electric utilities required to be rate-regulated under this chapter may request an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan modification during the course of a five-year plan. A modification may be requested due to changes in funding as a result of public utility customers requesting exemptions from the plan or for any other reason identified by the gas or electric utility. The board shall take action on a modification request made by a gas or electric utility within ninety days after the modification request is filed. If the board fails to take action within ninety days after a modification request is filed, the modification request shall be deemed approved.\n\n(3) The board shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A establishing reasonable processes and procedures for utility customers from any customer class to request exemptions from energy efficiency plans that meet the requirements of subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (b). The rules adopted by the board shall only apply to electric utilities that are required to be rate-regulated.\n\nb. A gas and electric utility required to be rate-regulated under this chapter shall assess potential energy and capacity savings available from actual and projected customer usage by applying commercially available technology and improved operating practices to energy-using equipment and buildings. The utility shall submit the assessment to the board. Upon receipt of the assessment, the board shall consult with the economic development authority to develop specific capacity and energy savings performance standards for each utility. The utility shall submit an energy efficiency plan which shall include economically achievable programs designed to attain these energy and capacity performance standards. The board shall periodically report the energy efficiency results including energy savings of each utility to the general assembly.\n\nc. (1) The board shall conduct contested case proceedings for review of energy efficiency plans, demand response plans, and budgets filed by gas and electric utilities required to be rate-regulated under this chapter.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the goals developed pursuant to paragraph “b”, the board shall not require or allow a gas utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan that results in projected cumulative average annual costs that exceed one and one-half percent of the gas utility’s expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue from retail customers in the state, shall not require or allow an electric utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan that results in projected cumulative average annual costs that exceed two percent of the electric utility’s expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue from retail customers in the state, and shall not require or allow an electric utility to adopt a demand response plan that results in projected cumulative average annual costs that exceed two percent of the electric utility’s expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue from retail customers in the state. For purposes of determining the two percent threshold amount, the board shall exclude from an electric utility’s expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue the revenues expected from customers that have received exemptions from energy efficiency plans pursuant to paragraph “a”. This subparagraph shall apply to energy efficiency plans and demand response plans that are effective on or after January 1, 2019.\n\n(3) The board may approve, reject, or modify the plans and budgets. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17A.19, subsection 5, in an application for judicial review of the board’s decision concerning a utility’s plan or budget, the reviewing court shall not order a stay.\n\n(4) The board shall approve, reject, or modify a plan filed pursuant to this subsection no later than March 31, 2019. If the board fails to approve, reject, or modify a plan filed by a gas or electric utility on or before such date, any plan filed by the gas or electric utility that was approved by the board prior to May 4, 2018, shall be terminated. The board shall not require or allow a gas or electric utility to implement an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan that does not meet the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(5) Whenever a request to modify an approved plan or budget is filed subsequently by a gas or electric utility required to be rate-regulated under this chapter, the board shall promptly initiate a formal proceeding if the board determines that any reasonable ground exists for investigating the request. The formal proceeding may be initiated at any time by the board on its own motion. Implementation of board-approved plans or budgets shall be considered continuous in nature and shall be subject to investigation at any time by the board or the office of the consumer advocate.\n\nd. Notice to customers of a contested case proceeding for review of energy efficiency plans, demand response plans, and budgets shall be in a manner prescribed by the board.\n\ne. (1) A gas or electric utility required to be rate-regulated under this chapter may recover, through an automatic adjustment mechanism filed pursuant to subsection 8, over a period not to exceed the term of the plan, the costs of an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan approved by the board in a contested case proceeding conducted pursuant to paragraph “c”. Customers that have been granted exemptions from energy efficiency plans pursuant to paragraph “a”, shall not be charged for recovery of energy efficiency costs beginning January 1 of the year following the year in which the customer was granted the exemption.\n\n(2) The board shall periodically conduct a contested case proceeding to evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the utility’s implementation of an approved energy efficiency or demand response plan and budget. If a utility is not taking all reasonable actions to cost-effectively implement an approved plan, the board shall not allow the utility to recover from customers costs in excess of those costs that would be incurred under reasonable and prudent implementation and shall not allow the utility to recover future costs at a level other than what the board determines to be reasonable and prudent. If the result of a contested case proceeding is a judgment against a utility, that utility’s future level of cost recovery shall be reduced by the amount by which the programs were found to be imprudently conducted. Beginning January 1, 2019, a gas or electric utility shall represent energy efficiency and demand response in customer billings as a separate cost or expense.\n\nf. A rate-regulated utility required to submit an energy efficiency plan under this subsection shall, upon the request of a state agency or political subdivision to which it provides service, provide advice and assistance regarding measures which the state agency or political subdivision might take in achieving improved energy efficiency results. The cooperation shall include assistance in accessing financial assistance for energy efficiency measures.\n\n16. Filing of forecasts. The board shall periodically require each rate-regulated gas or electric public utility to file a forecast of future gas requirements or electric generating needs and the board shall evaluate the forecast. The forecast shall include but is not limited to a forecast of the requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and its anticipated means of addressing the forecasted gas requirements or electric generating needs.\n\n17. Allocation of replacement tax costs.\n\na. The costs of the replacement tax imposed pursuant to chapter 437A or 437B shall be reflected in the charges of utilities subject to rate regulation, in lieu of the utilities’ costs of property taxes. The imposition of the replacement taxes pursuant to chapter 437A is not intended to initiate any change in the rates and charges for the sale of electricity, the sale of natural gas, or the transportation of natural gas that is subject to regulation by the board and in effect on January 1, 1999. The implementation and initial imposition of the replacement taxes pursuant to chapter 437B is not intended to result in an increase in the rates and charges for the sale of water that is subject to regulation by the board and in effect on January 1, 2013.\n\nb. The cost of the replacement taxes imposed by chapter 437A or 437B shall be allocated among and within customer classes in a manner that will replicate the tax cost burden of the current property tax on individual customers to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nc. Upon the restructuring of the electric industry in this state so that individual consumers are given the right to choose their electric suppliers, replacement tax costs shall be assigned to the service corresponding to the individual generation, transmission, and delivery taxes. In all other respects, the allocation of the replacement tax costs among and within the customer classes shall remain the same to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nd. Notwithstanding this subsection, the board may determine the amount of replacement tax properly included in retail rates subject to its jurisdiction. The board may determine whether the base rates or some other form of rate is most appropriate for recovery of the costs of the replacement tax, subject to the requirement that utility rates be reasonable and just. The board may also determine the appropriate allocation of the tax. Any significant modification to rate design relating to the replacement tax shall be made in a manner consistent with this subsection unless made in a contested case proceeding where the impact of such modification on competition and consumer costs is considered.\n\n18. Recovery of management costs. A public utility which is assessed management costs by a local government pursuant to chapter 480A is entitled to recover those costs. If the public utility serves customers within the boundaries of the local government imposing the management costs, such costs shall be recovered exclusively from those customers.\n\n19. Electric power generating facility emissions.\n\na. It is the intent of the general assembly that the state, through a collaborative effort involving state agencies and affected generation owners, provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric energy policies with respect to regulated emissions from rate-regulated electric power generating facilities in the state that are fueled by coal. Each rate-regulated public utility that is an owner of one or more electric power generating facilities fueled by coal and located in this state may develop a multiyear plan and budget or update an existing plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its facilities in a reasonably cost-effective manner as provided in this subsection.\n\n(1) A rate-regulated public utility in this state that is an owner of one or more electric power generating facilities fueled by coal may, in its sole discretion, file an update to a multiyear plan. The update may seek advanced review and approval of cost recovery for pollution and emissions control projects useful for managing the environmental regulatory requirements for pollutants or other emissions from such facilities in a reasonably cost-effective manner.\n\n(2) Copies of the plan and budget, as well as any subsequent updates, shall be served on the department of natural resources. The board shall consider the plan or update in a contested case proceeding pursuant to chapter 17A. The department of natural resources and the consumer advocate shall participate as parties to the proceeding.\n\n(3) A rate-regulated public utility electing to seek advanced review of an emissions control project shall submit an application for advanced review before the anticipated start of construction or installation of the project. If an electric power generating facility is owned by two or more rate-regulated public utilities, the operator of the electric power generating facility may file the application on behalf of all rate-regulated public utility owners.\n\n(4) The department of natural resources shall state whether the plan or update meets applicable state environmental requirements for regulated emissions. If the plan or update does not meet these requirements, the department shall recommend amendments that outline actions necessary to bring the plan or update into compliance with the environmental requirements.\n\nb. The board shall not approve a plan or update that does not meet applicable state environmental requirements and federal ambient air quality standards for regulated emissions from electric power generating facilities located in the state.\n\nc. The board shall review the plan or update and the associated budget, and shall approve the plan or update and the associated budget if the plan or update and the associated budget are reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective compliance with applicable state environmental requirements and federal ambient air quality standards. In reaching its decision, the board shall consider whether the plan or update and the associated budget reasonably balance costs, environmental requirements, economic development potential, and the reliability of the electric generation and transmission system.\n\nd. The board shall issue an order approving or rejecting a plan, update, or budget within one hundred eighty days after the public utility’s filing is deemed complete; however, upon good cause shown, the board may extend the time for issuing the order as follows:\n\n(1) The board may grant an extension of thirty days.\n\n(2) The board may grant more than one extension, but each extension must rely upon a separate showing of good cause.\n\n(3) A subsequent extension must not be granted any earlier than five days prior to the expiration of the original one-hundred-eighty-day period, or the current extension.\n\ne. The reasonable costs incurred by a rate-regulated public utility in preparing and filing the plan, update, or budget and in participating in the proceedings before the board and the reasonable costs associated with implementing the plan, update, or budget shall be included in its regulated retail rates.\n\nf. It is the intent of the general assembly that the board, in an environmental plan, update, or associated budget filed under this section by a rate-regulated public utility, may limit investments or expenditures that are proposed to be undertaken prior to the time that the environmental benefit to be produced by the investment or expenditure would be required by state or federal law.\n\n20. Preapproval of cost recovery for natural gas extensions — rules. The board may adopt rules which provide for a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas extensions.\n\n21. Federal tax reduction — customer benefits. Customers of gas and electric utilities subject to rate regulation by the board shall receive the full benefits of the utilities’ reduced federal corporate income taxes as provided in the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub.

In order to carry out the duties imposed upon it by law, the board may, at its discretion, allocate and charge directly the expenses attributable to its duties to the person bringing a proceeding before the board, to persons participating in matters before the board, or to persons subject to inspection by the board. The board shall ascertain the certified expenses incurred and directly chargeable by the consumer advocate division of the department of justice in the performance of its duties. The board and the consumer advocate separately may decide not to charge expenses to persons who, without expanding the scope of the proceeding or matter, intervene in good faith in a board proceeding initiated by a person subject to the board’s jurisdiction, the consumer advocate, or the board on its own motion. For assessments in any proceedings or matters before the board, the board and the consumer advocate separately may consider the financial resources of the person, the impact of assessment on participation by intervenors, the nature of the proceeding or matter, and the contribution of a person’s participation to the public interest. The board may present a bill for expenses under this subsection to the person, either at the conclusion of a proceeding or matter, or from time to time during its progress. Presentation of a bill for expenses under this subsection constitutes notice of direct assessment and request for payment in accordance with this section.\n\nb. The board shall ascertain the total of the board’s expenses incurred during each fiscal year in the performance of its duties under law. The board shall add to the total of the board’s expenses the certified expenses of the consumer advocate as provided under section 475A.6. The board shall deduct all amounts charged directly to any person from the total expenses of the board and the consumer advocate. The board may assess the amount remaining after the deduction to all persons providing service over which the board has jurisdiction in proportion to the respective gross operating revenues of such persons from intrastate operations during the last calendar year over which the board has jurisdiction. For purposes of determining gross operating revenues under this section, the board shall not include gross receipts received by a cooperative corporation or association for wholesale transactions with members of the cooperative corporation or association, provided that the members are subject to assessment by the board based upon the members’ gross operating revenues, or provided that such a member is an association whose members are subject to assessment by the board based upon the members’ gross operating revenues. If any portion of the remainder can be identified with a specific type of utility service, the board shall assess those expenses only to the entities providing that type of service over which the board has jurisdiction. The board may make the remainder assessments under this paragraph to some or all persons providing service over which the board has jurisdiction, based upon estimates of the expenditures for the fiscal year for the utilities board and the consumer advocate. Not more than ninety days following the close of the fiscal year, the utilities board shall conform the amount of the prior fiscal year’s assessments to the requirements of this paragraph. For gas and electric public utilities exempted from rate regulation pursuant to this chapter, and for providers of telecommunications service required to register with the board pursuant to section 476.95A that are exempted from rate regulation pursuant to this chapter, the remainder assessments under this paragraph shall be computed at one-half the rate used in computing the assessment for other persons.\n\n2. a. A person subject to a charge or assessment shall pay the board the amount charged or assessed against the person within thirty days from the time the board provides notice to the person of the amount due, unless the person files an objection in writing with the board setting out the grounds upon which the person claims that such charge or assessment is excessive, unreasonable, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid. Upon receipt of an objection, the board shall set the matter for hearing and issue its order in accordance with its findings in the proceeding.\n\nb. The order shall be subject to review in the manner provided in this chapter. All amounts collected by the board pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited with the treasurer of state and credited to the commerce revolving fund created in section 546.12. Such amounts shall be spent in accordance with the provisions of chapter 8.\n\n3. Whenever the board shall deem it necessary in order to carry out the duties imposed upon it in connection with rate regulation under section 476.6, investigations under section 476.3, or review proceedings under section 476.31, the board may employ additional temporary or permanent staff, or may contract with persons who are not state employees for engineering, accounting, or other professional services, or both. The costs of these additional employees and contract services shall be paid by the public utility whose rates are being reviewed in the same manner as other expenses are paid under this section. Beginning on July 1, 1991, there is appropriated out of any funds in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary to enable the board to hire additional staff and contract for services under this section. The board shall increase quarterly assessments specified in subsection 1, paragraph “b”, by amounts necessary to enable the board to hire additional staff and contract for services under this section. The authority to hire additional temporary or permanent staff that is granted to the board by this section shall not be subject to limitation by any administrative or executive order or decision that restricts the number of state employees or the filling of employee vacancies, and shall not be subject to limitation by any law of this state that restricts the number of state employees or the filling of employee vacancies unless that law is made applicable to this section by express reference to this section. Before the board expends or encumbers an amount in excess of the funds budgeted for rate regulation and before the board increases quarterly assessments pursuant to this subsection, the director of the department of management shall approve the expenditure or encumbrance. Before approval is given, the director of the department of management shall determine that the expenses exceed the funds budgeted by the general assembly to the board for rate regulation and that the board does not have other funds from which the expenses can be paid. Upon approval of the director of the department of management the board may expend and encumber funds for the excess expenses, and increase quarterly assessments to raise the additional funds. The board and the office of consumer advocate may add additional personnel or contract for additional assistance to review and evaluate energy efficiency plans and the implementation of energy efficiency programs including, but not limited to, professionally trained engineers, accountants, attorneys, skilled examiners and inspectors, and secretaries and clerks. The board and the office of consumer advocate may also contract for additional assistance in the evaluation and implementation of issues relating to telecommunication competition. The board and the office of the consumer advocate may expend additional sums beyond those sums appropriated. However, the authority to add additional personnel or contract for additional assistance must first be approved by the department of management. The additional sums for energy efficiency shall be provided to the board and the office of the consumer advocate by the utilities subject to the energy efficiency requirements in this chapter. Telephone companies shall pay any additional sums needed for assistance with telecommunication competition issues. The assessments shall be in addition to and separate from the quarterly assessment.\n\n4. a. Fees paid to the utilities board shall be deposited in the commerce revolving fund created in section 546.12. These funds shall be used for the payment, upon appropriation by the general assembly, of the expenses of the utilities board and the consumer advocate division of the department of justice.\n\nb. The administrator and consumer advocate shall account for receipts and disbursements according to the separate duties imposed upon the utilities board and the consumer advocate division by the laws of this state and each separate duty shall be fiscally self-sustaining.\n\nc. All fees and other moneys collected under this section and sections 478.4, 479.16, and 479A.9 shall be deposited into the commerce revolving fund created in section 546.12 and expenses required to be paid under this section shall be paid from funds appropriated for those purposes.\n\n[C66, 71, 73, 75, §490A.10; C77, 79, 81, §476.10; 81 Acts, ch 156, §7, ch 158, §1]\n\n83 Acts, ch 127, §28; 86 Acts, ch 1246, §613, 614; 89 Acts, ch 103, §1; 89 Acts, ch 296, §72; 89 Acts, ch 321, §30; 90 Acts, ch 1247, §11; 90 Acts, ch 1252, §29; 91 Acts, ch 260, §1236, 1237; 93 Acts, ch 131, §20, 21; 94 Acts, ch 1107, §80; 95 Acts, ch 199, §3; 2001 Acts, ch 9, §1, 3; 2009 Acts, ch 181, §45 – 47; 2018 Acts, ch 1160, §12; 2021 Acts, ch 75, §2; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §2674\n\nReferred to in §12.91, 475A.6, 476.1A, 476.1B, 476.1C, 476.10B, 476.53, 476.87, 476.95, 476.95B, 477A.3, 477C.3, 478.4, 479.14, 479.16, 479A.7, 479A.9\n\nSection amended",

The board shall establish rules requiring that the written notice contain additional information as it deems necessary and appropriate.\n\n3. a. The board shall adopt rules which shall be uniform with respect to rate-regulated public utilities furnishing gas or electricity relating to disconnection of service. The board shall adopt rules with respect to electric and gas utilities subject to sections 476.1A and 476.1B that prescribe the procedures and notice requirements for the disconnection of service consistent with the rules for rate-regulated public utilities, but such rules shall not regulate the rates of such utilities. This subsection applies to rate-regulated utilities, utilities subject to regulation under sections 476.1A and 476.1B, and to unincorporated villages which own their own distribution systems.

Municipally owned utilities and utilities subject to section 476.1A shall not be subject to the board’s rules in regard to deposits, rates and charges for the disconnection or reinstatement of service, and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and repayment of past due debt. Municipally owned utilities and utilities subject to section 476.1A shall be subject to the board’s rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the disconnection of services.\n\n(1) The deposit for a residential or commercial customer for a place which has previously received service shall not be greater than the highest billing of service for one month for the place in the previous twelve-month period.\n\n(2) The deposit for a residential or a commercial customer for a place which has not previously received service or for an industrial customer shall be the customer’s projected one month’s usage for the place to be serviced as determined by the public utility according to rules established by the board.\n\nb.

Any municipal corporation, after being authorized by a vote of the people, or any electric utility may file a petition with the board requesting a certificate of authority to furnish electric service to the existing point of delivery of any customer already receiving electric service from another electric utility. If, after notice by the board to the electric utility currently serving the customer, objection to the petition is not filed and investigation is not deemed necessary, the board shall issue a certificate within thirty days of the filing of the petition. When an objection is filed, if the board, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that service to the customer by the petitioner is in the public interest, including consideration of any unnecessary duplication of facilities, it shall grant this certificate in whole or in part, upon such terms, conditions, and restrictions as may be justified. Whether or not an objection is filed, any certificate issued shall require that the petitioner pay to the electric utility presently serving the customer, the reasonable price for facilities serving the customer. This price determination by the board shall include due consideration of the cost of the facilities being acquired; any necessary generating capacity and transmission capacity dedicated to the customer, including, but not limited to, electric power generating facilities and alternate energy production facilities not yet in service but for which the board has issued an order pursuant to section 476.53, and electric power generating facility emissions plan budgets approved by the board pursuant to section 476.6, subsection 19; depreciation; loss of revenue; and the cost of facilities necessary to reintegrate the system of the utility after detaching the portion sold.\n\n2. An electric utility shall not construct or extend facilities or furnish electric service to a prospective customer not presently being served, unless its existing service facilities are nearer the proposed point of delivery than the service facilities of any other utility. However, an electric utility may extend electric service and transmission lines if the electric utility closest to the delivery point consents to this extension in writing and a copy of the agreement is filed with the board or, if the board, after notice and opportunity for hearing and after giving due consideration to the prevention of unnecessary duplication of facilities, finds that service from an electric utility, other than the closest utility, is in the public interest. This subsection shall not apply if the prospective customers are within an exclusive service area assigned to an electric utility as provided in this subchapter.\n\n3.

In order to effect that public interest, the board may establish service areas within which specified electric utilities shall provide electric service to customers on an exclusive basis. Except for good cause expressed through formal public statement, the board shall establish these exclusive service areas on or before July 1, 1979. These exclusive service area boundaries shall be established by the board upon the following basis:\n\n1. The service area boundaries shall be in a line approximately equidistant between the electric distribution lines of adjacent electric utilities as they existed on January 1, 1976, and as shown by the maps filed in accordance with this subchapter. However, those boundaries may be modified by the board to promote the public interest, to preserve existing service areas and electric utilities’ rights to serve existing customers, and to prevent unnecessary duplication of facilities, to take account of natural and physical barriers which would make electric service beyond these barriers uneconomic and impractical and those boundaries shall be modified by the board to take account of the contracts between electric utilities which have been approved by the board pursuant to subsection 2 of this section. When an electric utility’s exclusive service area is established by the board to include existing customers presently served by the facilities of another electric utility, unless a voluntary exchange of facilities is agreed upon by the electric utilities involved and approved by the board, the board after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall require the purchase of those facilities presently serving these customers at a reasonable price to be determined by the board. The board, on its own motion or at the request of an electric utility or municipal corporation, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may modify the boundaries of an electric utility exclusive service area which it has previously established if this modification, including consideration of the factors noted in this subsection, is found to be in the public interest.\n\n2. Contracts between electric utilities to designate service areas and customers to be served by the electric utilities or for the exchange of customers between electric utilities, when approved by the board, shall be valid and enforceable and shall be incorporated into the appropriate exclusive service areas established pursuant to subsection 1 of this section. The board shall approve a contract if it finds that the contract will eliminate or avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities, will provide adequate electric service to all areas and customers affected, will promote the efficient and economical use and development of the electric systems of the contracting electric utilities, and is in the public interest.\n\n3.

The terms and conditions applicable to a crossing including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Notification required prior to the commencement of any crossing activity.\n\n(2) A requirement that the railroad and the public utility each maintain and repair the person’s own property within the railroad right-of-way, and bear responsibility for each person’s own acts and omissions; except that the public utility shall be responsible for any bodily injury or property damage that typically would be covered under a standard railroad protective liability insurance policy.\n\n(3) The amount and scope of insurance or self-insurance required to cover risks associated with a crossing.\n\n(4) A procedure to address the payment of costs associated with the relocation of public utility facilities within the railroad right-of-way necessary to accommodate railroad operations.\n\n(5) Terms and conditions for securing the payment of any damages by the public utility before it proceeds with a crossing.\n\n(6) Immediate access to a crossing for repair and maintenance of existing facilities in case of emergency.\n\n(7) Engineering standards for utility facilities crossing railroad rights-of-way.\n\n(8) Provision for expedited crossing, absent a claim of special circumstances, after payment by the public utility of the standard crossing fee, if applicable, and submission of completed engineering specifications to the railroad.\n\n(9) Other terms and conditions necessary to provide for the safe and reasonable use of a railroad right-of-way by a public utility, and consistent with rules adopted by the board, including any complaint procedures adopted by the board to enforce the rules.\n\nb. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and subject to subsection 4, a public utility that locates its facilities within the railroad right-of-way for a crossing, other than a crossing along the public roads of the state pursuant to chapter 477, shall pay the railroad a one-time standard crossing fee of seven hundred fifty dollars for each crossing. The standard crossing fee shall be in lieu of any license or any other fees or charges to reimburse the railroad for the direct expenses incurred by the railroad as a result of the crossing. The public utility shall also reimburse the railroad for any actual flagging expenses associated with a crossing in addition to the standard crossing fee.\n\n3. Powers not limited.\n\na. Notwithstanding subsection 2, rules adopted by the board shall not prevent a railroad and a public utility from otherwise negotiating the terms and conditions applicable to a crossing or the resolution of any disputes relating to such crossing.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, neither this subsection nor this section shall impair the authority of a public utility to secure crossing rights by easement pursuant to the exercise of the power of eminent domain.\n\n4. Special circumstances.\n\na. A railroad or public utility that believes special circumstances exist for a particular crossing may petition the board for relief.\n\n(1) If a petition for relief is filed, the board shall determine whether special circumstances exist that necessitate either a modification of the direct expenses to be paid, or the need for additional terms and conditions.\n\n(2) The board may make any necessary findings of fact and determinations related to the existence of special circumstances, as well as any relief to be granted.\n\n(3) A determination of the board, except for a determination on the issue of damages for the rights granted to a public utility with respect to a crossing, shall be considered final agency action subject to judicial review under chapter 17A.\n\n(4) The board shall assess the costs associated with a petition for relief equitably against the parties.\n\nb. A railroad or public utility that claims to be aggrieved by a determination of the board on the issue of damages for the rights granted to a public utility with respect to a crossing may seek judicial review as provided in subsection 5.\n\n5. Appeals.\n\na. A railroad or public utility that claims to be aggrieved by the board’s determination of damages for rights granted to a public utility may appeal the board’s determination to the district court in the same manner as provided in section 6B.18 and sections 6B.21 through 6B.23. In any appeal of the determination of damages, the public utility shall be considered the applicant, and the railroad shall be considered the condemnee. References in sections 6B.18 and 6B.21 to “compensation commission” mean the board as defined in this section, or appointees of the board.\n\nb. An appeal of any determination of the board other than the issues of damages for rights granted to a public utility shall be pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\n6. Authority to cross — emergency relief.\n\na. Pending board resolution of a claim of special circumstances raised in a petition, a public utility may, upon securing the payment of any damages, and upon submission of completed engineering specifications to the railroad, proceed with a crossing in accordance with the rules adopted by the board, unless the board, upon application for emergency relief, determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that either of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) That the proposed crossing involves a significant and imminent likelihood of danger to the public health or safety.\n\n(2) That the proposed crossing is a serious threat to the safe operations of the railroad or to the current use of the railroad right-of-way.\n\nb. If the board determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed crossing meets either condition, then the board shall immediately intervene to prevent the crossing until a factual determination is made.\n\n7. Conflicting provisions. Notwithstanding any provision of the Code to the contrary, this section shall apply in all crossings of railroad rights-of-way involving a public utility as defined in this section, and shall govern in the event of any conflict with any other provision of law.\n\n2001 Acts, ch 138, §1, 2; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §62; 2004 Acts, ch 1049, §191; 2004 Acts, ch 1175, §393; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2015 Acts, ch 115, §1 – 3\n\nReferred to in §306.46, 476.1A, 476.1B, 476.95A",

      "text": "476.49 Billing methods for distributed generation customers.\n\n1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Alternate energy production facility” means the same as defined in section 476.42.\n\nb. “Distributed generation customer” means a person other than a public utility that interconnects an eligible distributed generation facility to an electric distribution system.\n\nc. “Distributed generation facility” means an alternative energy production facility or a small hydro facility as defined in section 476.42.\n\nd. “Electric utility” means a public utility that furnishes electricity to the public for compensation that is required to be rate-regulated under this chapter.\n\ne. “Eligible distributed generation facility” means a distributed generation facility that elects a billing method pursuant to subsection 3, and to which all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The facility is located behind a customer’s electricity meter.\n\n(2) The facility is interconnected to the electric utility distribution system.\n\n(3) The facility has an aggregate nameplate capacity less than or equal to one megawatt alternating current.\n\n(4) The facility has a capability to produce no more than one hundred ten percent of the customer’s annual electricity usage.\n\n(5) The facility’s generating capacity and associated energy is intended to serve only the on-site electric requirements of the customer.\n\nf. “Inflow-outflow billing” means a billing method for an eligible distributed generation facility whereby the net metering interval is measured hourly or subhourly, and a distributed generation customer makes payment and is credited as provided in subsection 3, paragraph “b”.\n\ng. “Net billing” means a billing method for an eligible distributed generation facility whereby the net metering interval is equal to a monthly billing period, and a distributed generation customer makes payment and is credited as provided in subsection 3, paragraph “a”.\n\nh. “Net metering” means a single meter monitoring only the net amount of electricity delivered to and exported by an eligible distributed generation facility, which electricity offsets electricity that would otherwise be purchased by a distributed generation customer from the electric utility.\n\ni. “Statewide distributed generation penetration” means the aggregate nameplate capacity of all eligible distributed generation facilities of electric utilities as a percentage of the aggregate peak demand of all electric utilities.\n\n2. Publication of data. The board shall collect data on the nameplate capacity of eligible distributed generation facilities, calculate the statewide distributed generation penetration percentage, and publish the data and penetration rate on an annual basis on the board’s internet site.\n\n3. Billing methods. An electric utility shall file either a net billing or an inflow-outflow billing tariff with the board to govern the billing and crediting of eligible distributed generation facilities interconnected with the electric distribution system of an electric utility as follows:\n\na. (1) An electric utility choosing to utilize the net billing method shall file a tariff with the board whereby a distributed generation customer pays all applicable charges, including applicable rider charges approved by the board and applied to non-net metering customers, for the electricity delivered to the customer over the net metering interval. A distributed generation customer shall be credited in kilowatt-hours for energy exported to the electric utility over the net metering interval. A distributed generation customer may use the kilowatt-hour credits to offset kilowatt-hours in future billing periods. The offset shall include any applicable volumetric rider charges approved by the board and applied to non-net metering customers.\n\n(2) Any excess kilowatt-hours remaining at the end of a twelve-month period shall be cashed out at the electric utility’s avoided cost rate with the funds from the cash out divided evenly between the customer and the electric utility’s low-income home energy assistance program. The distributed generation customer shall choose either a January or April cash out date at the time of interconnection.\n\n(3) Net billing shall not be limited in any way based on a customer’s peak demand.\n\n(4) Net billing shall not include any fees or charges that are not charged to customers in the same rate class that are not net billing customers.\n\nb. (1) An electric utility choosing to utilize the inflow-outflow billing method shall file a tariff with the board whereby a distributed generation customer pays all applicable charges, including applicable rider charges approved by the board and applied to non-net metering customers, for the electricity delivered by the electric utility over the net metering interval. The distributed generation customer is credited in dollars at the outflow purchase rate for energy exported to the utility over the net metering interval. The distributed generation customer may use the dollar credits to offset any applicable volumetric charges, including applicable rider charges, billed on a kilowatt-hour basis.\n\n(2) The electric utility shall select an hourly or subhourly metering interval that balances the benefits of accurately measuring power flows in each direction with the cost of collecting, storing, and processing meter data.\n\n(3) Inflow-outflow billing shall not be limited in any way based on a customer’s peak demand.\n\n(4) Inflow-outflow billing shall not include any fees or charges that are not charged to customers in the same rate class that are not inflow-outflow customers.\n\n(5) Prior to the board’s approval of a value of solar methodology and rate, the outflow purchase rate for an eligible distributed generation facility shall be the applicable retail volumetric rate, including applicable rider charges approved by the board and applied to non-net metered customers. The outflow purchase rate for any distributed generation facility will continue to be the applicable retail volumetric rate for a term of twenty years. Any change in ownership of such eligible facility, or adoption and use by the electric utility of a value-of-solar rate pursuant to subsection 4, shall not impact the outflow purchase rate for the distributed generation facility during the twenty-year term.\n\n4. Value of solar methodology. If the board is petitioned by an electric utility after July 1, 2027, or when the statewide distributed generation penetration rate is equal to five percent, whichever is earlier, the board shall initiate a proceeding to develop a value of solar methodology and rate for eligible distributed generation facilities. The value of solar rate shall be determined through the use of a methodology that calculates the benefits and costs an eligible distributed generation facility provides to, or imposes on, the electric system. The value of solar methodology shall be applied independently to each electric utility. When the board determines the value of solar methodology, it shall determine if there is a need for separate methodologies for other distributed generation technologies or if it can account for the values of other technologies with modifications to the value of solar methodology.\n\na. In establishing the methodology, the board shall initiate a formal proceeding. The value of solar methodology shall be determined through a study conducted by an independent third party and overseen by the board. Interested parties shall have the opportunity to comment and offer testimony on any proposed value of solar methodology before it is adopted by the board.\n\nb. The benefits and costs in a value of solar methodology shall include all of the following factors as appropriate and supported by known and measurable evidence:\n\n(1) The cost of energy and fuel.\n\n(2) Generation capacity and reserves.\n\n(3) Transmission capacity and charges.\n\n(4) Distribution capacity.\n\n(5) Transmission and distribution line losses.\n\n(6) Fixed and variable costs associated with plant operations and maintenance.\n\n(7) Environmental compliance costs.\n\n(8) Integration costs.\n\n(9) Grid support services.\n\n(10) Other factors, based on known and measurable evidence of the cost or benefit of solar operations to the electric utility’s electric system.\n\nc. Upon approval of the value of solar methodology, the outflow purchase rate shall be limited to either a five percent increase or decrease from the previous outflow purchase rate. The value of solar rate shall be recomputed annually and reflected in the outflow purchase rate, limited to a five percent increase or decrease from the previous outflow purchase rate. If the utility switches from a net billing method to an inflow-outflow billing method after the value of solar methodology is approved, then the previous purchase rate shall be the applicable retail volumetric rate including all applicable rider charges approved by the board.\n\nd. The board shall consider, review, and update as appropriate the value of solar methodology at least every three years after completion of the initial methodology.\n\ne. After the board has approved a value of solar methodology and rate, the outflow purchase rate shall be set using the value of solar methodology. The outflow purchase rate for such a facility will be fixed for a term of twenty years regardless of any subsequent changes in the electric utility’s outflow purchase rate or changes in ownership of such facility.\n\n5. Forfeiture of outflow purchase credits. Any outflow purchase credits remaining at the end of an annual period shall be forfeited to the rider used by the electric utility pursuant to subsection 7. The distributed generation customer shall choose either a January or April date at the time of interconnection for the purposes of determining the annual period.\n\n6. Proposal of separate rate classes. An electric utility shall not propose treating distributed generation customers as a separate rate class in a general rate case prior to the board’s approval of a value of solar methodology or prior to July 1, 2027, whichever is earlier. If an electric utility chooses to propose a separate rate class for distributed generation customers in a future proceeding, such a proposal shall be approved or disapproved in accordance with section 476.6 and accompanying rules.\n\n7. Riders. An electric utility shall be allowed to recover the amounts credited to an eligible distributed generation customer for outflow purchases pursuant to a rider. To the extent an electric utility does not have such a rider, the board shall allow an electric utility to establish a rider to recover such amounts. For purposes of this subsection,“rider” includes a fuel or energy adjustment clause.\n\n8. Preexisting tariff. Any customer utilizing a net billing tariff approved by the board on or before the availability of inflow-outflow billing may continue to receive electric service pursuant to the preexisting tariff for the remaining duration of the contract regardless of any subsequent changes in ownership of such facility.\n\n9. Use of funds collected through alternate energy purchase programs. An electric utility may use funds collected pursuant to section 476.47 to offset any amounts that would otherwise be recovered through a rider resulting from outflow purchases of excess energy produced by an eligible distributed generation facility.\n\n10. Reasonableness of net billing and inflow-outflow billing. When the statewide net metering penetration level reaches ten percent, the board shall determine whether the net billing and inflow-outflow billing methods are still reasonable and shall make recommendations to the general assembly. Regardless of the board’s recommendations, existing facilities shall continue to be eligible for the net billing or inflow-outflow billing tariff in place at the time of installation and for twenty years of operation thereafter.\n\n2020 Acts, ch 1004, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §310",

It is the intent of the general assembly to attract the development of electric power generating and transmission facilities within the state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to encourage rate-regulated public utilities to consider altering existing electric generating facilities, where reasonable, to manage carbon emission intensity in order to facilitate the transition to a carbon-constrained environment.\n\n2. a. The general assembly’s intent with regard to the development of electric power generating and transmission facilities, or the significant alteration of an existing generating facility, as provided in subsection 1, shall be implemented in a manner that is cost-effective and compatible with the environmental policies of the state, as expressed in this Title XI.\n\nb. The general assembly’s intent with regard to the reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers, as provided in subsection 1, shall be implemented by considering the diversity of the types of fuel used to generate electricity, the availability and reliability of fuel supplies, and the impact of the volatility of fuel costs.\n\n3. a. The board shall specify in advance, by order issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles that will apply when the costs of the electric power generating facility or alternate energy production facility are included in regulated electric rates whenever a rate-regulated public utility does any of the following:\n\n(1) (a) Files an application pursuant to section 476A.3 to construct in Iowa a baseload electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than three hundred megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power generating facility, or an alternate energy production facility as defined in section 476.42, or to significantly alter an existing generating facility. For purposes of this subparagraph, a significant alteration of an existing generating facility must, in order to qualify for establishment of ratemaking principles, fall into one of the following categories:\n\n(i) Conversion of a coal fueled facility into a gas fueled facility.\n\n(ii) Addition of carbon capture and storage facilities at a coal fueled facility.\n\n(iii) Addition of gas fueled capability to a coal fueled facility, in order to convert the facility to one that will rely primarily on gas for future generation.\n\n(iv) Addition of a biomass fueled capability to a coal fueled facility.\n\n(v) Repowering of an alternate energy production facility. For purposes of this subparagraph subdivision, “repowering” shall mean either the complete dismantling and replacement of generation equipment at an existing project site, or the installation of new parts and equipment to an existing alternate energy production facility in order to increase energy production, reduce load, increase service capacity, improve project reliability, or extend the useful life of the facility.\n\n(b) With respect to a significant alteration of an existing generating facility, an original facility shall not be required to be either a baseload or a combined-cycle facility. Only the incremental investment undertaken by a utility under subparagraph division (a), subparagraph subdivision (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) shall be eligible to apply the ratemaking principles established by the order issued pursuant to paragraph “e”. Facilities for which advanced ratemaking principles are obtained pursuant to this section shall not be subject to a subsequent board review pursuant to section 476.6, subsection 19, to the extent that the investment has been considered by the board under this section. To the extent an eligible utility has been authorized to make capital investments subject to section 476.6, subsection 19, such investments shall not be eligible for ratemaking principles pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) Leases or owns in Iowa, in whole or in part, a new baseload electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than three hundred megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power generating facility, or a new alternate energy production facility as defined in section 476.42.\n\nb. In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Among the principles and mechanisms the board may consider, the board has the authority to approve ratemaking principles proposed by a rate-regulated public utility that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the ability of the public utility to seek a general increase in electric rates under section 476.6 for at least three years after the generating facility begins providing service to Iowa customers.\n\nc. In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall make the following findings:\n\n(1) The rate-regulated public utility has in effect a board-approved energy efficiency plan as required under section 476.6, subsection 15.\n\n(2) The rate-regulated public utility has demonstrated to the board that the public utility has considered other sources for long-term electric supply and that the facility or lease is reasonable when compared to other feasible alternative sources of supply.\n\nd. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined in a contested case proceeding, which proceeding may be combined with the proceeding for issuance of a certificate conducted pursuant to chapter 476A.\n\ne. The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking principles shall be issued prior to the commencement of construction or lease of the facility.\n\nf. Following issuance of the order, the rate-regulated public utility shall have the option of proceeding according to either of the following:\n\n(1) Withdrawing its application for a certificate pursuant to chapter 476A.\n\n(2) Proceeding with the construction or lease of the facility.\n\ng. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order issued pursuant to paragraph “e” shall be binding with regard to the specific electric power generating facility in any subsequent rate proceeding.\n\n4. The utilities board and the consumer advocate may employ additional temporary staff, or may contract for professional services with persons who are not state employees, as the board and the consumer advocate deem necessary to perform required functions as provided in this section, including but not limited to review of power purchase contracts, review of emission plans and budgets, and review of ratemaking principles proposed for construction or lease of a new generating facility. Beginning July 1, 2002, there is appropriated out of any funds in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary to enable the board and the consumer advocate to hire additional staff and contract for services under this section. The costs of the additional staff and services shall be assessed to the utilities pursuant to the procedure in section 476.10 and section 475A.6.\n\n83 Acts, ch 127, §36, 50\n\n; 2001 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 4, §12, 36\n\n; 2002 Acts, 2nd Ex, ch 1003, §31, 35\n\n; 2003 Acts, ch 29, §5, 6; 2003 Acts, ch 159, §2 – 4; 2004 Acts, ch 1101, §67; 2010 Acts, ch 1176, §2, 3; 2010 Acts, ch 1193, §55, 69, 80; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §113; 2015 Acts, ch 29, §61; 2015 Acts, ch 138, §46, 161, 162; 2018 Acts, ch 1135, §18; 2018 Acts, ch 1160, §15\n\nReferred to in §476.23, 476A.4, 476A.6, 476A.7",

In addition, if the utility to be acquired is a city utility, then the public utility shall not acquire the city utility until the city has first met the requirements of section 388.2A.\n\nb. If a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility that is the subject of an acquisition meets the requirements of paragraph “a”, then the acquiring public utility may apply to the board, prior to the completion of the acquisition, for advance approval of a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers of the acquired utility.\n\nc.

In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates, including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition.\n\ne.
