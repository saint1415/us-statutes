Political subdivisions of the state, school districts, area education agencies, and community colleges shall design and construct the most energy cost-effective facilities feasible and may use financing facilitated by the authority to cover the incremental costs above minimum building code energy efficiency standards of purchasing energy-efficient devices and materials unless other lower cost financing is available. As used in this section, “facility” means a structure that is heated or cooled by a mechanical or electrical system, or any system of physical operation that consumes energy to carry out a process.\n\n6. The authority shall not require the state, state agencies, political subdivisions of the state, school districts, area education agencies, and community colleges to implement a specific energy management improvement identified in an energy analysis if the entity which prepared the analysis demonstrates to the authority that the facility which is the subject of the energy management improvement is unlikely to be used or operated for the full period of the expected savings payback of all costs associated with implementing the energy management improvement, including without limitation, any fees or charges of the authority, engineering firms, financial advisors, attorneys, and other third parties, and all financing costs including interest, if financed.\n\n86 Acts, ch 1167, §3\n\nC87, §93.20\n\n87 Acts, ch 209, §2; 90 Acts, ch 1252, §12; 90 Acts, ch 1253, §120; 91 Acts, ch 253, §8\n\nC93, §473.20\n\n94 Acts, ch 1029, §30; 2001 Acts, ch 60, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1126, §27 – 29, 33; 2009 Acts, ch 108, §35, 41; 2011 Acts, ch 118, §50, 89\n\nReferred to in §279.53, 298.3, 473.19, 473.20A",
