      "text": "455D.2 Findings.\n\nThe general assembly finds that:\n\n1. Iowa’s environment is precious and no person has the right to pollute Iowa’s air, water, or soil. The environment is vulnerable and irreplaceable, and all Iowans have an ongoing responsibility to conserve, preserve, and enhance the state’s natural resources to guarantee their continued existence and use by the present and future generations.\n\n2. The land itself is the source of Iowa’s livelihood not only for the purposes of an agricultural economy, but for the establishment of manufacturing plants, business offices, and residences. While zoning establishes restrictions on the use of land for social order, a similar system has not been established to maintain environmental order below the ground. Protection of the environment includes not only visible but invisible threats as well.\n\n3. The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of waste disposal today means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the groundwater supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for decades, if not centuries, without decomposition.\n\n4. Wastes filling Iowa’s landfills may, at best, represent a potential resource. However, without proper management, wastes are hazards to the environment and life itself.\n\n5. The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to sanitary landfills and increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public.\n\n89 Acts, ch 272, §2",

      "text": "455D.3 Goals for waste stream reduction — procedures — reductions and increases in fees.\n\n1. Waste reduction goals.\n\na. The goal of the state is to reduce the amount of materials in the waste stream, existing as of July 1, 1988, by an intermediate goal of twenty-five percent, and by a final goal of at least fifty percent, through the practice of waste volume reduction at the source and through recycling. For the purposes of this section, “waste stream” means the disposal of solid waste as “solid waste” is defined in section 455B.301.\n\nb. Notwithstanding section 455D.1, subsection 5, facilities which employ combustion of solid waste with energy recovery and refuse-derived fuel, which are included in an approved comprehensive plan, may include these processes in the definition of recycling for the purpose of meeting the state goal if at least thirty-five percent of the fifty percent waste reduction goal is met through volume reduction at the source and recycling and reuse, as established pursuant to section 455B.301A, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”.\n\n2. Departmental monitoring.\n\na. If at any time the department determines that a planning area has met or exceeded the twenty-five percent goal, but has not met or exceeded the fifty percent goal, a planning area shall subtract sixty cents from the total amount of the tonnage fee imposed pursuant to section 455B.310. If at any time the department determines that a planning area has met or exceeded the fifty percent goal, a planning area shall subtract fifty cents from the total amount of the tonnage fee imposed pursuant to section 455B.310. The reduction in tonnage fees pursuant to this paragraph shall be taken from that portion of the tonnage fees which would have been allocated for funding alternatives to landfills pursuant to section 455E.11, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1).\n\nb. If the department determines that a planning area has failed to meet the twenty-five percent goal, the planning area shall remit fifty cents per ton to the department. The moneys shall be deposited in the groundwater protection fund created in section 455E.11, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, and credited to the solid waste account of the fund to be used for funding alternatives to landfills pursuant to section 455E.11, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1). Moneys shall continue to be remitted pursuant to this paragraph until such time as evidence of attainment of the twenty-five percent goal is documented in subsequent plans submitted to the department.\n\nc. If at any time the department determines that a planning area has met or exceeded the fifty percent goal, the planning area shall subtract fifty cents from the total amount of the tonnage fee imposed pursuant to section 455B.310. This amount shall be in addition to any amount subtracted pursuant to paragraph “a”. The reduction in tonnage fees pursuant to this paragraph shall be taken from that portion of the tonnage fees which would have been allocated to funding alternatives to landfills pursuant to section 455E.11, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1). A planning area failing to meet the fifty percent goal is not required to remit any additional tonnage fees to the department.\n\n3. Environmental management systems. A planning area designated as an environmental management system pursuant to section 455J.7 is exempt from the waste stream reduction goals of this section.\n\n89 Acts, ch 272, §3; 92 Acts, ch 1213, §2; 94 Acts, ch 1177, §4; 95 Acts, ch 80, §2; 95 Acts, ch 209, §25; 98 Acts, ch 1193, §3; 2001 Acts, ch 124, §2, 6; 2006 Acts, ch 1063, §2; 2008 Acts, ch 1109, §2; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §108; 2013 Acts, ch 12, §14, 15\n\nReferred to in §455B.306, 455B.310, 455J.5",

It is the policy of this state to encourage the development of waste volume reduction programs and education at the local government level through incentives, technical assistance, grants, and other practical measures.\n\n2. It is the policy of this state to support and encourage the development of new uses and markets for recycled goods, placing emphasis on the development, in Iowa, of businesses relating to waste reduction and recycling.\n\n3. The provision of education concerning waste volume reduction at the elementary through high school levels and through community organizations will enhance the success of local programs requiring public involvement.\n\n4. This state supports and encourages manufacturing methods which are environmentally sustainable, technologically safe, and ecologically sound. The state shall encourage manufacturing methods which enhance waste reduction by creating products with longer usage life, and by creating products which are adaptable to secondary uses, require less input material, and decrease resource consumption.\n\n5. The people of this state recognize that a variety of benefits result from a comprehensive waste reduction policy including the following environmental, economic, governmental, and public benefits:\n\na. Not producing waste in the first instance is the most certain means for avoiding the widely recognized health and environmental damage associated with waste. Although waste reduction will never eliminate all wastes, to the extent that waste reduction is achieved it results in the most certain form of direct risk reduction.\n\nb. Waste reduction may result in reduced pollution control costs for industry by stimulating and promoting beneficial technological and management reorganization within industry in place of pollution control strategies which channel capital into nonproductive pollution control expenditures.\n\nc. The government is better able to administer programs which offer a variety of benefits to industry and which reduce the overall cost of government involvement than it is to administer programs which offer few benefits to industry and require increasingly extensive, complex, and costly governmental actions.\n\nd. Public confidence in environmental policies of the government is important for the effectiveness of these policies. Waste reduction poses no adverse environmental and public health effects and does not, therefore, lead to increased public concern. Waste reduction also increases the public confidence that the government and industry are doing all that is possible to protect human health and the environment.\n\n89 Acts, ch 272, §4",

      "text": "455D.4A Recycling.\n\n1. For the purpose of this section, “recycling facility” means any facility, business, or operation that has the stated primary purpose of facilitating the recycling of materials that would otherwise be solid waste.\n\n2. Recycling of materials for the purpose of being excluded from the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, subchapter IV, part 1, must be legitimate. A material that is not legitimately recycled is discarded material and is a solid waste. In determining if recycling is legitimate, a recycling facility must establish all of the following:\n\na. The material is potentially recyclable and has a feasible means of being recycled into a valuable product.\n\nb. The material is being managed as a valuable commodity while under the facility’s control.\n\nc. The material is not being accumulated speculatively pursuant to subsection 7.\n\n3. If the department determines that a facility is not legitimately recycling material, the department may allow the facility owner or operator an opportunity to comply with the criteria in subsection 2, or may immediately deem the facility subject to the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, subchapter IV, part 1.\n\n4. The criteria in subsection 2 are intended to mitigate the risk posed by facilities that accumulate materials speculatively prior to recycling by preventing materials that are not otherwise regulated under chapter 455B, subchapter IV, part 1, from being stored indefinitely and potentially causing a public health nuisance or adverse environmental impact. In response to enforcement initiated by the department for alleged violations of this section, the burden of proof falls on the recycling facility owner or operator to establish that materials are being legitimately recycled.\n\n5. To establish that a material is potentially recyclable and has a feasible means of being recycled into a valuable product, a recycling facility owner or operator shall maintain with an end user at least one purchase contract, a letter of understanding, or other formal agreement. Such documentation must be provided to the department upon request. In addition, if the material is going to be recycled in an unusual manner, the owner or operator may use technical specifications from the end user or other documentation to prove recycling the material in such manner will result in a valuable product.\n\n6. To establish that a material is being managed as a valuable commodity while under the facility’s control, a recycling facility owner or operator shall ensure that stockpiled material is not speculatively accumulated by maintaining current inventory records and is managed in a manner consistent with comparable recyclable materials or products in an equally protective manner.\n\n7. To establish that a material is not being accumulated speculatively, the recycling facility owner or operator must document that, during a given calendar year, the amount of material that is recycled, or transferred to a different site for recycling, equals at least seventy-five percent by weight or volume of the amount of material accumulated at the beginning of the period. Materials must be placed in a storage unit with a label indicating the first date that the material began to be accumulated. If placing a label on the storage unit is not practicable, the accumulation period must be documented through an inventory log or other appropriate method.\n\n8. Failure to provide documentation upon request to the department relative to the requirements of this section is grounds for the department to immediately deem the facility not in compliance with this section.\n\n9. Scrap metal is not subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n2018 Acts, ch 1023, §7; 2019 Acts, ch 59, §139 – 141; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §150\n\nReferred to in §455B.301, 455D.1, 455D.22, 455D.23, 455D.25",

Programs established shall encourage waste generators to reduce the volume of waste generated and to recycle or properly dispose of the waste that is generated. The network shall utilize existing recycling companies when possible. The programs may utilize financial and legal incentives, education, technical assistance, regulation, and other methods as appropriate to implement the programs. The programs may involve the development of public and private sector initiatives, the development of markets and other opportunities for waste reduction and recycling, and other related efforts.\n\n2. The elements of the network shall include but are not limited to all of the following:\n\na. Promotion of efforts to increase the amount of recyclable materials used by the public.\n\nb. Promotion of efforts to recover recyclable materials from the waste stream.\n\nc. Promotion of local efforts to implement recycling collection centers located at disposal sites or other convenient local sites.\n\nd.

      "text": "455D.19 Packaging — heavy metal content.\n\n1. The general assembly finds and declares all of the following:\n\na. The management of solid waste can pose a wide range of hazards to public health and safety and to the environment.\n\nb. Packaging comprises a significant percentage of the overall solid waste stream.\n\nc. The presence of heavy metals in packaging is a concern in light of the likely presence of heavy metals in emissions or ash when packaging is incinerated or in leachate when packaging is landfilled.\n\nd. Lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern.\n\ne. It is desirable as a first step in reducing the toxicity of packaging waste to eliminate the addition of heavy metals to packaging.\n\nf. The intent of the general assembly is to achieve reduction in toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of postconsumer materials in the production of packaging and its components.\n\n2. As used in this section unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Distributor” means a person who takes title to one or more packages or packaging components purchased for promotional purposes or resale. A person involved solely in delivering or storing packages or packaging components on behalf of third parties is not a distributor.\n\nb. “Incidental presence” means the presence of a regulated metal as an unintended or undesired ingredient of a package or packaging component.\n\nc. “Intentional introduction” means an act of deliberately utilizing a regulated metal in the formulation of a package or packaging component where its continued presence is desired in the final package or packaging component to provide a specific characteristic, appearance, or quality. Intentional introduction does not include the use of a regulated metal as a processing agent or intermediate to impart certain chemical or physical changes during manufacturing, if the incidental presence of a residue of the metal in the final package or packaging component is neither desired nor deliberate, and if the final package or packaging component is in compliance with subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3). Intentional introduction also does not include the use of recycled materials as feedstock for the manufacture of new packaging materials, if the recycled materials contain amounts of a regulated metal and if the new package or packaging component is in compliance with subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3).\n\nd. “Manufacturer” means a person who produces one or more packages or packaging components.\n\ne. “Manufacturing” means physical or chemical modification of one or more materials to produce packaging or packaging components.\n\nf. “Package” means a container which provides a means of marketing, protecting, or handling a product including a unit package, intermediate package, or a shipping container. “Package” also includes but is not limited to unsealed receptacles such as carrying cases, crates, cups, pails, rigid foil and other trays, wrappers and wrapping films, bags, and tubs.\n\ng. “Packaging component” means any individual assembled part of a package including but not limited to interior and exterior blocking, bracing, cushioning, weatherproofing, exterior strapping, coatings, closures, inks, labels, tin-plated steel that meets ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international specification A-623, electro-galvanized coated steel, or hot-dipped-coated galvanized steel that meets ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international specification A-525 or A-879.\n\nh. “Regulated metal” means any metal regulated under this section.\n\ni. “Reusable entities” means packaging or packaging components having a controlled distribution and reuse subject to the exemption provided in subsection 5, paragraph “e”.\n\n3. A manufacturer or distributor shall not offer for sale or sell or offer for promotional purposes a package or packaging component, in this state, which includes, in the package itself or in any packaging component, inks, dyes, pigments, adhesives, stabilizers, or any other additives, any lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium which has been intentionally introduced as an element during manufacturing or distribution as opposed to the incidental presence of any of these elements and which exceed the concentration level established by the department. A distributor shall only be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to section 455D.25, subsection 2, for the knowing violation of this section. Knowledge by the distributor of the violation shall be presumed beginning sixty days from the receipt of notification from the department by certified mail.\n\n4. a. The concentration levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium present in a package or packaging component shall not exceed the following:\n\n(1) Six hundred parts per million by weight by July 1, 1992.\n\n(2) Two hundred fifty parts per million by weight by July 1, 1993.\n\n(3) One hundred parts per million by weight by July 1, 1994.\n\nb. Concentration levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium shall be determined using ASTM (American society for testing and materials) international test methods, as revised, or United States environmental protection agency test methods for evaluating solid waste, S-W 846, as revised.\n\n5. The following packaging and packaging components are exempt from the requirements of this section:\n\na. Packaging or packaging components with a code indicating a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 1990, and packaging or packaging components used by the alcoholic beverage industry or the wine industry prior to July 1, 1992.\n\nb. Packages or packaging components to which lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium have been added in the manufacturing, forming, printing, or distribution process in order to comply with health or safety requirements of federal law or for which there is no feasible alternative if the manufacturer of a package or packaging component petitions the department for an exemption from the provisions of this paragraph for a particular package or packaging component. The department may grant a two-year exemption, if warranted by the circumstances, and an exemption may, upon meeting either criterion of this paragraph, be renewed for two years. For purposes of this paragraph, a use for which there is no feasible alternative is one in which the regulated substance is essential to the protection, safe handling, or function of the package’s contents.\n\nc. Packages and packaging components that would not exceed the maximum contaminant levels established but for the addition of recycled materials.\n\nd. (1) Packages or packaging components that are reused, but exceed contaminant levels set forth in subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n(a) The product being conveyed by the package, including any packaging component, is regulated under federal or state health or safety requirements.\n\n(b) Transportation of the packaged product is regulated under federal or state transportation requirements.\n\n(c) The disposal of the packages or packaging components is performed according to federal or state radioactive or hazardous waste disposal requirements.\n\n(2) The department may grant a two-year exemption if warranted by the circumstances and an exemption may, upon meeting the criteria of this paragraph, be renewed for additional two-year periods.\n\ne. (1) Packages or packaging components which qualify as reusable entities that exceed the contaminant levels set forth in subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), if the manufacturers or distributors of such packages or packaging components petition the department for an exemption and receive approval from the department according to the following standards based upon a satisfactory demonstration that the environmental benefit of the controlled distribution and reuse is significantly greater than if the same package is manufactured in compliance with the contaminant levels set forth in subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3). The department may grant a two-year exemption, if warranted by the circumstances, and an exemption may, upon meeting the four criteria listed in subparagraph (2), subparagraph divisions (a) through (d), be renewed for additional two-year periods.\n\n(2) In order to receive an exemption, the application must ensure that reusable entities are used, transported, and disposed of in a manner consistent with the following criteria:\n\n(a) A means of identifying in a permanent and visible manner those reusable entities containing regulated metals for which an exemption is sought.\n\n(b) A method of regulatory and financial accountability so that a specified percentage of the reusable entities manufactured and distributed to another person are not discarded by that person after use, but are returned to the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s designee.\n\n(c) A system of inventory and record maintenance to account for the reusable entities placed in, and removed from, service.\n\n(d) A means of transforming returned entities, that are no longer reusable, into recycled materials for manufacturing or into manufacturing wastes which are subject to existing federal or state laws or regulations governing manufacturing wastes to ensure that these wastes do not enter the commercial or municipal waste stream.\n\n(3) The application for an exemption must document the measures to be taken by the applicant as set out in subparagraph (2), subparagraph divisions (a) through (d).\n\n6. a. A manufacturer or distributor of packaging or packaging components shall make available to purchasers, to the department, and to the general public upon request, certificates of compliance which state that the manufacturer’s or distributor’s packaging or packaging components comply with, or are exempt from, the requirements of this section.\n\nb. If the manufacturer or distributor of the package or packaging component reformulates or creates a new package or packaging component, the manufacturer or distributor shall provide an amended or new certificate of compliance for the reformulated or new package or packaging component.\n\n7.
