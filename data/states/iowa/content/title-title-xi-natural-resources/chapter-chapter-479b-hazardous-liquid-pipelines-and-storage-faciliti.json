Upon the request of the petitioning county, the board shall schedule a hearing to consider the merits of the petition. Rules adopted under this section shall not apply to land located within city boundaries unless the land is used for agricultural purposes. Rules adopted under this section shall address, but are not limited to, all of the following subject matters:\n\na. Topsoil separation and replacement.\n\nb. Temporary and permanent repair to drain tile.\n\nc. Removal of rocks and debris from the right-of-way.\n\nd. Restoration of areas of soil compaction.\n\ne.

A county board of supervisors may contract for the services of a licensed professional engineer for the purposes of the inspection. The reasonable costs of the inspection shall be paid by the pipeline company.\n\n3.

The costs of the corrective action shall be borne by the contractor operating for the pipeline company.\n\n4. An inspector shall adequately inspect underground improvements altered during construction of the pipeline. An inspection shall be conducted at the time of the replacement or repair of the underground improvements. An inspector shall be present on the site at all times at each phase and separate activity of the opening of the trench, the restoration of underground improvements, and backfilling. The pipeline company and its contractor shall keep an inspector continually informed of the work schedule and any schedule changes. If proper notice is given, construction shall not be delayed due to an inspector’s failure to be present on the site.\n\n5. If the pipeline company or its contractor does not comply with the requirements of this section, with the land restoration plan or line location, or with an independent agreement on land restoration executed in accordance with subsection 10, the county board of supervisors may petition the board for an order requiring corrective action to be taken.

Petitioners for a permit for pipeline construction shall file with the petition a written land restoration plan showing how the requirements of this section, and of rules adopted pursuant to this section, will be met. The company shall provide copies of the plan to all landowners of property that will be disturbed by the construction.\n\n10. This section does not preclude the application of provisions for protecting or restoring property that are different than those prescribed in this section, in rules adopted under this section, or in the land restoration plan, if the alternative provisions are contained in agreements independently executed by the pipeline company and the landowner, and if the alternative provisions are not inconsistent with state law or with rules adopted by the board. Independent agreements on land restoration or line location between the landowner and pipeline company shall be in writing and a copy provided to the county inspector.\n\n11. For the purposes of this section, “construction” includes the removal of a previously constructed pipeline.\n\n12.

The application shall contain all of the following information:\n\na. The name and address of the applicant and a description of the land on which the damage is claimed to have occurred.\n\nb.
