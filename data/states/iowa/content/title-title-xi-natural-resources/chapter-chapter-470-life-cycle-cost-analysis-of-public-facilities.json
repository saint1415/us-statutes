On or after May 26, 2016, a public agency responsible for the construction or renovation of a facility or the construction of an addition shall, in a design begun after that date, include as a design criterion the requirement that a life cycle cost analysis be conducted for the facility. The objectives of the life cycle cost analysis are to optimize energy efficiency at an acceptable life cycle cost.
