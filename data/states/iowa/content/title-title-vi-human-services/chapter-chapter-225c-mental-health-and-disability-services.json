      "text": "225C.1 Findings and purpose.\n\n1. The general assembly finds that services to persons with mental illness, an intellectual disability, developmental disabilities, or brain injury are provided in many parts of the state by highly autonomous community-based service providers working cooperatively with state and county officials. However, the general assembly recognizes that heavy reliance on property tax funding for mental health and intellectual disability services has enabled many counties to exceed minimum state standards for the services resulting in an uneven level of services around the state. Consequently, greater efforts should be made to ensure close coordination and continuity of care for those persons receiving publicly supported disability services in Iowa. It is the purpose of this chapter to continue and to strengthen the services to persons with disabilities now available in the state of Iowa, to make disability services conveniently available to all persons in this state upon a reasonably uniform financial basis, and to assure the continued high quality of these services.\n\n2. It is the intent of the general assembly that the service system for persons with disabilities emphasize the ability of persons with disabilities to exercise their own choices about the amounts and types of services received; that all levels of the service system seek to empower persons with disabilities to accept responsibility, exercise choices, and take risks; that disability services are individualized, provided to produce results, flexible, and cost-effective; and that disability services be provided in a manner which supports the ability of persons with disabilities to live, learn, work, and recreate in communities of their choice.\n\n[81 Acts, ch 78, §1, 20]\n\n94 Acts, ch 1170, §10; 2006 Acts, ch 1115, §2; 2012 Acts, ch 1019, §60\n\nReferred to in §225C.6B, 426B.5",

The amount of reductions to quarterly payments and amounts paid to the department under this paragraph shall be transferred and credited to the region incentive fund under subsection 8.\n\n8. a. A region incentive fund is created in the mental health and disability services regional service fund under subsection 1. The incentive fund shall consist of the moneys appropriated or credited to the incentive fund by law, including amounts credited to the incentive fund under subsection 7. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in the incentive fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any other fund but shall remain in the incentive fund for use in subsequent fiscal years. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, there is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the incentive fund the following amounts to be used for the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2021, three million dollars.\n\n(2) (a) For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025, an amount equal to the incentive fund growth factor multiplied by the ending balance of the incentive fund at the conclusion of the fiscal year ending June 30 immediately preceding the application deadline under paragraph “b” for the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made.\n\n(b) For purposes of this subparagraph, the “incentive fund growth factor” for each fiscal year is the percent increase, if any, in the amount of sales tax revenue deposited into the general fund of the state under section 423.2A, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, less the transfers required under section 423.2A, subsection 2, between the fiscal year beginning three years prior to the applicable fiscal year and the fiscal year beginning two years prior to the applicable year, minus one and one-half percent, and the incentive fund growth factor for any fiscal year shall not exceed three and one-half percent.\n\nb. To receive funding from the incentive fund, a regional administrator must submit to the department sufficient data to demonstrate that the region has met the standards outlined in the region’s performance-based contract. The purpose of the incentive fund shall be to provide appropriate financial incentives for outcomes met from services provided by the regional administrator’s mental health and disability services region. The department shall make its final decisions on or before December 15 regarding acceptance or rejection of the submissions for incentive funds applications for assistance and the total amount accepted shall be considered obligated.\n\nc. In addition to incentive submission requirements under paragraphs “d”, “e”, and “g”, basic eligibility for incentive funds requires that a mental health and disability services region meet all of the following conditions:\n\n(1) The mental health and disability services region is in compliance with the regional service system management plan requirements of section 225C.60.\n\n(2) (a) In the fiscal year that commenced two years prior to the fiscal year of application for incentive funds, the ending balance, under generally accepted accounting principles, of the mental health and disability services region’s combined services funds was equal to or less than the ending balance threshold under subparagraph division (b) for the fiscal year for which assistance is requested.\n\n(b) For purposes of this subparagraph (2), “ending balance threshold” means the following:\n\n(i) For applications for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2021, forty percent of the actual expenditures of the mental health and disability services region for the fiscal year that commenced two years prior to the fiscal year of application for assistance.\n\n(ii) For applications for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022, twenty percent of the actual expenditures of the mental health and disability services region for the fiscal year that commenced two years prior to the fiscal year of application for assistance.\n\n(iii) For applications for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2023, five percent of the actual expenditures of the mental health and disability services region for the fiscal year that commenced two years prior to the fiscal year of application for assistance.\n\nd. The department shall review the fiscal year-end financial records for all mental health and disability services regions that are granted incentive funds. If the department determines a mental health and disability services region’s actual need for incentive funds was less than the amount of incentive funds granted to the mental health and disability services region, the mental health and disability services region shall refund the difference between the amount of assistance granted and the actual need. The mental health and disability services region shall submit the refund within thirty days of receiving notice from the department. Refunds shall be credited to the incentive fund.\n\ne. The department shall determine application requirements to ensure prudent use of the incentive fund. The department may accept or reject an application for incentive funds in whole or in part. The decision of the department is final.\n\nf. The total amount of incentive funds approved shall be limited to the amount available in the incentive fund for a fiscal year. Any unobligated balance in the incentive fund at the close of a fiscal year shall remain in the incentive fund for distribution in the succeeding fiscal year.\n\ng. Incentive funds shall only be made available to address one or more of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) To reimburse regions for reductions in available funding for core services as the result of the reduction and elimination of the levy under section 331.424A, Code 2021, if the region has an operating deficit. The department shall prioritize approval of incentive funds for the circumstances specified in this subparagraph.\n\n(2) To incentivize quality core services that meet or exceed the defined outcomes in the performance-based contract.\n\n(3) To support regional efforts to fund non-core services that support the defined outcomes of core services in the performance-based contract.\n\n(4) To support non-core services to maintain an individual in a community setting or that would create a risk that the individuals needing services and supports would be placed in more restrictive, higher-cost settings.\n\nh. Subject to the amount available and obligated from the incentive fund for a fiscal year, the department shall annually calculate the amount of moneys due to eligible mental health and disability services regions in accordance with the department’s decisions and that amount is appropriated from the incentive fund to the department for payment of the moneys due. The department shall distribute incentive funds payable to the mental health and disability services regions for the amounts due on or before January 1.\n\ni. On or before March 1 and September 1 of each fiscal year, the department shall provide the governor’s office and the general assembly with a report of the financial condition of the incentive fund. The report shall include but is not limited to an itemization of the funding source’s balances, types and amount of revenues credited, and payees and payment amounts for the expenditures made from the funding source during the reporting period.\n\nj. If the department has made its decisions but has determined that there are otherwise qualifying requests for incentive funds that are beyond the amount available in the incentive fund for a fiscal year, the department shall compile a list of such requests and the supporting information for the requests. The list and information shall be submitted to the commission, the children’s behavioral health system state board, and the general assembly.\n\n9.

For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “County of residence” means the county in this state in which, at the time a person applies for or receives services, the person is living and has established an ongoing presence with the declared, good faith intention of living in the county for a permanent or indefinite period of time. The county of residence of a person who is a homeless person is the county where the homeless person usually sleeps. A person maintains residency in the county or state in which the person last resided while the person is present in another county or this state receiving services in a hospital, a correctional facility, a halfway house for community-based corrections or substance use disorder treatment, a nursing facility, an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, or a residential care facility, or for the purpose of attending a college or university.\n\nb. “Homeless person” means the same as defined in section 48A.2.\n\nc. “Mental health professional” means the same as defined in section 228.1.\n\nd. “Person” means a person who is a United States citizen or a qualified alien as defined in 8 U.S.C. §1641.\n\n2. If a person appeals a decision regarding a service authorization or other services-related decision made by a regional administrator that cannot be resolved informally, the appeal shall be heard in a contested case proceeding by a state administrative law judge. The administrative law judge’s decision shall be considered final agency action under chapter 17A.\n\n3. If a service authorization or other services-related decision made by a regional administrator concerning a person varies from the type and amount of service identified to be necessary for the person in a clinical determination made by a mental health professional and the mental health professional believes that failure to provide the type and amount of service identified could cause an immediate danger to the person’s health or safety, the person may request an expedited review of the regional administrator’s decision to be made by the department. An expedited review held in accordance with this subsection is subject to the following procedures:\n\na. The request for the expedited review shall be filed within five business days of receiving the notice of decision by the regional administrator. The request must be in writing, plainly state the request for an expedited review in the caption and body of the request, and be supported by written documentation from the mental health professional who made the clinical determination stating how the notice of decision on services could cause an immediate danger to the person’s health or safety.\n\nb. The expedited review shall be performed by a designee of the director who is a mental health professional and is free of any conflict of interest to perform the expedited review. The expedited review shall be performed within two business days of the time the request is filed. If the reviewer determines the information submitted in connection with the request is inadequate to perform the review, the reviewer shall request the submission of additional information and the review shall be performed within two business days of the time that adequate information is submitted. The regional administrator and the person, with the assistance of the mental health professional who made the clinical determination, shall each provide a brief statement of facts, conclusions, and reasons for the decision made. Supporting clinical information shall also be attached. All information related to the proceedings and any related filings shall be considered to be mental health information subject to chapter 228.\n\nc. The director’s designee shall issue an order, including a brief statement of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and policy reasons for the order, to justify the decision made concerning the expedited review. If the decision concurs with the contention that there is an immediate danger to the person’s health or safety, the order shall identify the type and amount of service which shall be provided for the person. The director’s designee shall give such notice as is practicable to persons who are required to comply with the order. The order is effective when issued.\n\nd. The decision of the director’s designee shall be considered a final agency action and is subject to judicial review in accordance with section 17A.19. The record for judicial review consists of any documents regarding the matter that were considered or prepared by the director’s designee. The director’s designee shall maintain these documents as the official record of the decision. If the matter is appealed to the district court, the record shall be filed as confidential.\n\n4. The responsibilities of the county under law regarding mental health and disability services shall be performed on behalf of the county by the regional administrator. The mental health and disability services region is responsible for paying the public costs of the mental health and disability services that are not covered by the medical assistance program under chapter 249A and are provided in accordance with the region’s approved service management plan to persons who are residents of the region.\n\n5. a.

If the county or region asserts that the person has residency in another county or region, the county or region shall notify the other county or region within one hundred twenty days of receiving the billing for services.\n\nc. The county or region that received the notification, as applicable, shall respond to the party that provided the notification within forty-five days of receiving the notification. If the parties cannot agree to a settlement as to the person’s residency status within ninety days of the date of notification, on motion of any of the parties, the matter shall be referred to the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing for a contested case hearing under chapter 17A before an administrative law judge assigned in accordance with section 10A.801 to determine the person’s residency status.\n\nd. (1) The administrative law judge’s determination of the person’s residency status shall be considered final agency action, notwithstanding contrary provisions of section 17A.15. The party that does not prevail in the determination or subsequent judicial review is liable for costs associated with the proceeding, including reimbursement of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing’s actual costs associated with the administrative proceeding. Judicial review of the determination may be sought in accordance with section 17A.19.\n\n(2) If following the determination of a person’s residency status in accordance with this subsection, additional evidence becomes available that merits a change in that determination, the parties affected may change the determination by mutual agreement. Otherwise, a party may move that the matter be reconsidered by the county or region, or by the administrative law judge.\n\ne. (1) Unless a petition is filed for judicial review, the administrative law judge’s determination of the person’s residency status shall result in one of the following:\n\n(a) If a county or region is determined to be the person’s residence, the county or region shall pay the amounts due and shall reimburse any other amounts paid for services provided by the other county or region on the person’s behalf prior to the determination.\n\n(b) If it is determined that the person is not a resident of this state neither the region in which the services were provided nor the state shall be liable for payment of amounts due for services provided to the person prior to the determination.\n\n(2) The payment or reimbursement shall be remitted within forty-five days of the date the determination was issued. After the forty-five-day period, a penalty of not greater than one percent per month may be added to the amount due.\n\n6. a.

If a county, region, or the department, as applicable, disputes a billing for service costs listed in paragraph “a”, the dispute shall be resolved as provided in this subsection. The county or region shall notify the department of the county’s or region’s assertion within ninety days of receiving the billing. However, for services provided on or after July 1, 2011, for which a county has received the billing as of July 1, 2012, the county shall notify the department of the county’s assertion on or before October 1, 2012. If the department disputes such a billing of a regional administrator, the department shall notify the affected counties or regions of the department’s assertion.\n\nc. The department, county, or region that received the notification, as applicable, shall respond to the party that provided the notification within forty-five days of receiving the notification.

Otherwise, a party may move that the matter be reconsidered by the department, county, or region, or by the administrative law judge.\n\ne. (1) Unless a petition is filed for judicial review, the administrative law judge’s decision regarding a disputed billing shall result in one of the following:\n\n(a) If a county or region is determined to be responsible for the disputed amounts, the county or region shall pay the amounts due and shall reimburse any other amounts paid for services provided by the other county or region or the department on the person’s behalf prior to the decision.\n\n(b) If it is determined that the state is responsible for the disputed amounts, the state shall pay the amounts due and shall reimburse the county or region, as applicable, for any payment made on behalf of the person prior to the decision.\n\n(2) The payment or reimbursement shall be remitted within forty-five days of the date the decision was issued.
