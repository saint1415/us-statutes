The superintendent shall separately compute by program the average daily patient charge for a mental health institute for services provided in the following fiscal year, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, by totaling the expenditures of the program for the immediately preceding calendar year, by adjusting the expenditures by a percentage not to exceed the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for the immediately preceding calendar year, and by dividing the adjusted expenditures by the total inpatient days of service provided in the program during the immediately preceding calendar year. However, the superintendent shall not include the following in the computation of the average daily patient charge:\n\n(1) The costs of food, lodging, and other maintenance provided to persons not patients of the state mental health institute.\n\n(2) The costs of certain direct medical services identified in administrative rule, which may include but need not be limited to x-ray, laboratory, and dental services.\n\n(3) The costs of outpatient and state placement services.\n\n(4) The costs of the psychiatric residency program.\n\n(5) The costs of the chaplain intern program.\n\nb.

The superintendent shall certify to the department the billings to the regional administrator of the person’s county of residence for services provided to the person and chargeable to the county of residence during the preceding calendar quarter. The county of residence billings shall be based on the average daily patient charge and other service charges computed pursuant to subsection 1, and the number of inpatient days and other service units chargeable to the regional administrator of the person’s county of residence. However, a county of residence billing shall be decreased by an amount equal to reimbursement by a third party payor or estimation of such reimbursement from a claim submitted by the superintendent to the third party payor for the preceding calendar quarter. When the actual third party payor reimbursement is greater or less than estimated, the difference shall be reflected in the billing in the calendar quarter the actual third party payor reimbursement is determined.\n\nb.

The department shall certify to the regional administrator by February 1 the actual per-patient-per-day costs, as computed pursuant to subsection 3, and the actual costs owed by each regional administrator itemized for each county in the region for the immediately preceding calendar year for patients chargeable to the regional administrator. If the actual costs owed by the regional administrator are greater than the charges billed to the regional administrator pursuant to subsection 2, the department shall bill the regional administrator for the difference itemized for each county in the region with the billing for the quarter ending June 30. If the actual costs owed by the regional administrator are less than the charges billed to the regional administrator pursuant to subsection 2, the department shall credit the regional administrator for the difference itemized for each county in the region starting with the billing for the quarter ending June 30.\n\n5. An individual statement shall be prepared for a patient on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the patient leaves the mental health institute, and a general statement shall be prepared at least quarterly for each regional administrator itemized for each county in the region to which charges are made under this section.

The statement prepared for each regional administrator shall be certified by the department.\n\n6. All or any reasonable portion of the charges incurred for services provided to a patient, to the most recent date for which the charges have been computed, may be paid at any time by the patient or by any other person on the patient’s behalf. Any payment made by the patient or other person, and any federal financial assistance received pursuant to Tit. XVIII or XIX of the federal Social Security Act for services rendered to a patient, shall be credited against the patient’s account and, if the charges paid as described in this subsection have previously been billed to a regional administrator on behalf of the person’s county of residence, reflected in the mental health institute’s next general statement to that regional administrator.\n\n7. A superintendent of a mental health institute may request that the director enter into a contract with a person for the mental health institute to provide consultation or treatment services or for fulfilling other purposes which are consistent with the purposes stated in section 226.1. The contract provisions shall include charges which reflect the actual cost of providing the services or fulfilling the other purposes. Any income from a contract authorized under this subsection may be retained by the mental health institute to defray the costs of providing the services. Except for a contract voluntarily entered into by a county under this subsection, the costs or income associated with a contract authorized under this subsection shall not be considered in computing charges and per diem costs in accordance with the provisions of subsections 1 through 6.\n\n8.
