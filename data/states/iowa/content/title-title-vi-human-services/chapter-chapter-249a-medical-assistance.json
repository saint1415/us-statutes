Without limiting the generality of the foregoing delegation of authority, the director is hereby specifically empowered and directed to:\n\n1. Determine the greatest amount, duration, and scope of assistance which may be provided, and the broadest range of eligible individuals to whom assistance may effectively be provided, under this chapter within the limitations of available funds. In so doing, the director shall at least every six months evaluate the scope of the program currently being provided under this chapter, project the probable cost of continuing a like program, and compare the probable cost with the remaining balance of the state appropriation made for payment of assistance under this chapter during the current appropriation period. After each evaluation of the scope of the program, the director shall report to the general assembly through the legislative council or in another manner as the general assembly may by resolution direct.\n\n2. Reserved.\n\n3. Have authority to provide for payment under this chapter of assistance rendered to any applicant prior to the date the application is filed.\n\n4. Have authority to contract with any corporation authorized to engage in this state in insuring groups or individuals for all or part of the cost of medical, hospital, or other health care or with any corporation maintaining and operating a medical, hospital, or health service prepayment plan under the provisions of chapter 514 or with any health maintenance organization authorized to operate in this state, for any or all of the benefits to which any recipients are entitled under this chapter to be provided by such corporation or health maintenance organization on a prepaid individual or group basis.\n\n5. May, to the extent possible, contract with a private organization or organizations whereby such organization will handle the processing of and the payment of claims for services rendered under the provisions of this chapter and under such rules and regulations as shall be promulgated by such department. The state department may give due consideration to the advantages of contracting with any organization which may be serving in Iowa as “intermediary” or “carrier” under Tit. XVIII of the federal Social Security Act, as amended.\n\n6. Shall cooperate with any agency of the state or federal government in any manner as may be necessary to qualify for federal aid and assistance for medical assistance in conformity with the provisions of chapter 249, this chapter, and Tit.

Shall provide for the professional freedom of those licensed practitioners who determine the need for or provide medical care and services, and shall provide freedom of choice to recipients to select the provider of care and services, except when the recipient is eligible for participation in a health maintenance organization or prepaid health plan which limits provider selection and which is approved by the department.\n\na. However, this shall not limit the freedom of choice to recipients to select providers in instances where such provider services are eligible for reimbursement under the medical assistance program but are not provided under the health maintenance organization or under the prepaid health plan, or where the recipient has an already established program of specialized medical care with a particular provider. The department may also restrict the recipient’s selection of providers to control the individual recipient’s overuse of care and services, provided the department can document this overuse. The department shall promulgate rules for determining the overuse of services, including rights of appeal by the recipient.\n\nb. Advanced registered nurse practitioners licensed pursuant to chapter 152 and physician assistants licensed pursuant to chapter 148C shall be regarded as approved providers of health care services, including primary care, for purposes of managed care or prepaid services contracts under the medical assistance program.

The promotion of efficient and cost-effective delivery of medical and health services.\n\nb. Compliance with federal law and regulations.\n\nc. The level of state and federal appropriations for medical assistance.\n\nd. Reimbursement at a level as near as possible to actual costs and charges after priority is given to the considerations in paragraphs “a”, “b”, and “c”.\n\n10. a. Allow supplementation of the combination of client participation and payment made through the medical assistance program for those items and services identified in\n\n42 C.F.R. §483.10(c)(8)(ii)\n\n, by the resident of a nursing facility or the resident’s family. Supplementation under this subsection may include supplementation for provision of a private room not otherwise covered under the medical assistance program unless either of the following applies:\n\n(1) The private room is therapeutically required pursuant to\n\n42 C.F.R. §483.10(c)(8)(ii)\n\n(2) No room other than the private room is available.\n\nb. The rules adopted to administer this subsection shall require all of the following if a nursing facility provides for supplementation for provision of a private room:\n\n(1) The nursing facility shall inform all current and prospective residents and residents’ legal representatives of the following:\n\n(a) If the resident desires a private room, the resident or resident’s family may provide supplementation by directly paying the facility the amount of supplementation. Supplementation by a resident’s family shall not be treated as income of the resident for purposes of medical assistance program eligibility or client participation.\n\n(b) The nursing facility’s policy if a resident residing in a private room converts from private pay to payment under the medical assistance program, but the resident or resident’s family is not willing or able to pay supplementation for the private room.\n\n(c) A description and identification of the private rooms for which supplementation is available.\n\n(d) The process for an individual to take legal responsibility for providing supplementation, including identification of the individual and the extent of the legal responsibility.\n\n(2) For a resident for whom the nursing facility receives supplementation, the nursing facility shall indicate in the resident’s record all of the following:\n\n(a) A description and identification of the private room for which the nursing facility is receiving supplementation.\n\n(b) The identity of the individual making the supplemental payments.\n\n(c) The private pay charge for the private room for which the nursing facility is receiving supplementation.\n\n(d) The total charge to the resident for the private room for which the nursing facility is receiving supplementation, the portion of the total charge reimbursed under the medical assistance program, and the portion of the total charge reimbursed through supplementation.\n\n(3) If the nursing facility only provides one type of room or all private rooms, the nursing facility shall not be eligible to request supplementation.\n\n(4) A nursing facility may base the supplementation amount on the difference between the amount paid for a room covered under the medical assistance program and the private pay rate for the private room identified for supplementation. However, the total payment for the private room from all sources shall not be greater than the aggregate average private room rate for the type of rooms covered under the medical assistance program for which the resident would be eligible.\n\n(5) Supplementation pursuant to this subsection shall not be required as a precondition of admission, expedited admission, or continued stay in a facility.\n\n(6) Supplementation shall not be applicable if the facility’s occupancy rate is less than fifty percent.\n\n(7) The nursing facility shall ensure that all appropriate care is provided to all residents notwithstanding the applicability or availability of supplementation.\n\n(8) A private room for which supplementation is required shall be retained for the resident consistent with existing bed-hold policies.\n\nc. (1) A nursing facility that utilizes the supplementation option and receives supplementation under this subsection during any calendar year shall report to the department annually, by January 15, the following information for the preceding calendar year:\n\n(a) The total number of nursing facility beds available at the nursing facility, the number of such beds available in private rooms, and the number of such beds available in other types of rooms.\n\n(b) The average occupancy rate of the facility on a monthly basis.\n\n(c) The total number of residents for which supplementation was utilized.\n\n(d) The average private pay charge for a private room in the nursing facility.\n\n(e) For each resident for whom supplementation was utilized, the total charge to the resident for the private room, the portion of the total charge reimbursed under the Medicaid program, and the total charge reimbursed through supplementation.\n\n(2) The department shall compile the information received and shall submit the compilation to the general assembly, annually by May 1.\n\n11. Shall provide an opportunity for a fair hearing before the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing to an individual whose claim for medical assistance under this chapter is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness. Upon completion of a hearing, the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing shall issue a decision which is subject to review by the department. Judicial review of the decisions of the department may be sought in accordance with chapter 17A. If a petition for judicial review is filed, the department shall furnish the petitioner with a copy of the application and all supporting papers, a transcript of the testimony taken at the hearing, if any, and a copy of its decision.\n\n12. In determining the medical assistance eligibility of a pregnant woman, infant, or child under the federal Social Security Act, §1902(l), resources which are used as tools of the trade shall not be considered.\n\n13. In implementing subsection 9, relating to reimbursement for medical and health services under this chapter, when a selected out-of-state acute care hospital facility is involved, a contractual arrangement may be developed with the out-of-state facility that is in accordance with the requirements of Tit. XVIII and XIX of the federal Social Security Act. The contractual arrangement is not subject to other reimbursement standards, policies, and rate setting procedures required under this chapter.\n\n14. A medical assistance copayment shall only be applied to those services and products specified in administrative rules of the department in effect on February 1, 1991, which under federal medical assistance requirements, are provided at the option of the state.\n\n15.

Assistance may be furnished under this chapter to an otherwise eligible recipient who is a resident of a health care facility licensed under chapter 135C and certified as an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability.\n\n2. If a county reimbursed the department for medical assistance provided under this section, Code 2011, and the amount of medical assistance is subsequently repaid through a medical assistance income trust or a medical assistance special needs trust as defined in section 633C.1, the department shall reimburse the county on a proportionate basis. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.\n\n3. a. Effective July 1, 1995, the state shall be responsible for all of the nonfederal share of the costs of intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability services provided under medical assistance to minors. Notwithstanding contrary provisions of section 222.73, Code 2011, effective July 1, 1995, a county is not required to reimburse the department and shall not be billed for the nonfederal share of the costs of such services provided to minors.\n\nb. The state shall be responsible for all of the nonfederal share of medical assistance home and community-based services waivers for persons with an intellectual disability services provided to minors, and a county is not required to reimburse the department and shall not be billed for the nonfederal share of the costs of the services.\n\nc. The state shall be responsible for all of the nonfederal share of the costs of intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability services provided under medical assistance attributable to the assessment for intermediate care facilities for individuals with an intellectual disability imposed pursuant to section 249A.21. A county is not required to reimburse the department and shall not be billed for the nonfederal share of the costs of such services attributable to the assessment.\n\n4. a. The mental health and disability services commission shall recommend to the department the actions necessary to assist in the transition of individuals being served in an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, who are appropriate for the transition, to services funded under a medical assistance home and community-based services waiver for persons with an intellectual disability in a manner which maximizes the use of existing public and private facilities. The actions may include but are not limited to submitting any of the following or a combination of any of the following as a request for a revision of the medical assistance home and community-based services waiver for persons with an intellectual disability:\n\n(1) Allow for the transition of intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability licensed under chapter 135C, to services funded under the medical assistance home and community-based services waiver for persons with an intellectual disability. The request shall be for inclusion of additional persons under the waiver associated with the transition.\n\n(2) Allow for reimbursement under the waiver for day program or other service costs.\n\n(3) Allow for exception provisions in which an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability which does not meet size and other facility-related requirements under the waiver in effect on June 30, 1996, may convert to a waiver service for a set period of time such as five years. Following the set period of time, the facility would be subject to the waiver requirements applicable to services which were not operating under the exception provisions.\n\nb. In implementing the provisions of this subsection, the mental health and disability services commission shall consult with other states. The waiver revision request or other action necessary to assist in the transition of service provision from intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability to alternative programs shall be implemented by the department in a manner that can appropriately meet the needs of individuals at an overall lower cost to counties, the federal government, and the state. In addition, the department shall take into consideration significant federal changes to the medical assistance program in formulating the department’s actions under this subsection. The department shall consult with the mental health and disability services commission in adopting rules for oversight of facilities converted pursuant to this subsection. A transition approach described in paragraph “a” may be modified as necessary to obtain federal waiver approval.\n\n5. a. The provisions of the home and community-based services waiver for persons with an intellectual disability shall include adult day care, prevocational, and transportation services. Transportation shall be included as a separately payable service.\n\nb. The department shall seek federal approval to amend the home and community-based services waiver for persons with an intellectual disability to include day habilitation services. Inclusion of day habilitation services in the waiver shall take effect upon receipt of federal approval.\n\n6. When paying the necessary and legal expenses for intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability services, the cost requirements of section 222.60 shall be considered fulfilled when payment is made in accordance with the medical assistance payment rates established by the department for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability, and the state shall not be obligated for any amount in excess of the rates.\n\n7. If services associated with the intellectual disability can be covered under a medical assistance home and community-based services waiver or other medical assistance program provision, the nonfederal share of the medical assistance program costs for such coverage shall be paid from the appropriation made for the medical assistance program.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §249A.12]\n\n83 Acts, ch 123, §96, 209; 84 Acts, ch 1297, §6; 94 Acts, ch 1120, §2; 94 Acts, ch 1163, §1; 95 Acts, ch 68, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1129, §113; 96 Acts, ch 1183, §30, 31; 2002 Acts, ch 1146, §5, 6; 2003 Acts, ch 62, §4, 8; 2003 Acts, ch 118, §1; 2004 Acts, ch 1086, §45 – 47; 2004 Acts, ch 1090, §15, 16; 2005 Acts, ch 38, §55; 2005 Acts, ch 175, §109 – 111; 2006 Acts, ch 1066, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1115, §15; 2007 Acts, ch 22, §56; 2010 Acts, ch 1031, §384 – 387, 389; 2012 Acts, ch 1019, §99 – 103; 2012 Acts, ch 1133, §58; 2012 Acts, ch 1138, §57; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §49, 50; 2016 Acts, ch 1139, §51; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §801\n\nReferred to in §28M.1, 331.402\n\nSubsection 5, paragraph b amended",

Medical assistance paid to, or on behalf of, a recipient or paid to a provider of services is not recoverable, except as provided in subsection 2, unless the assistance was incorrectly paid. Assistance incorrectly paid is recoverable from the provider, or from the recipient, while living, as a debt due the state and, upon the recipient’s death, as a claim classified with taxes having preference under the laws of this state.\n\n2. The provision of medical assistance to an individual who is fifty-five years of age or older, or who is a resident of a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, or mental health institute, who cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and return to the individual’s home, creates a debt due the department from the individual’s estate for all medical assistance provided on the individual’s behalf, upon the individual’s death.\n\na. The department shall waive the collection of the debt created under this subsection from the estate of a recipient of medical assistance to the extent that collection of the debt would result in either of the following:\n\n(1) Reduction in the amount received from the recipient’s estate by a surviving spouse, or by a surviving child who was under age twenty-one, blind, or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the individual’s death.\n\n(2) Otherwise work an undue hardship as determined on the basis of criteria established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396p(b)(3).\n\nb. If the collection of all or part of a debt is waived pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “a”, to the extent the medical assistance recipient’s estate was received by the following persons, the amount waived shall be a debt due from one of the following, as applicable:\n\n(1) The estate of the medical assistance recipient’s surviving spouse or child who is blind or has a disability, upon the death of such spouse or child.\n\n(2) A surviving child who was under twenty-one years of age at the time of the medical assistance recipient’s death, upon the child reaching the age of twenty-one or from the estate of the child if the child dies prior to reaching the age of twenty-one.\n\n(3) The estate of the recipient of the undue hardship waiver, at the time of death of the hardship waiver recipient, or from the hardship waiver recipient when the hardship no longer exists.\n\nc. For purposes of this section, the estate of a medical assistance recipient, surviving spouse, or surviving child includes any real property, personal property, or other asset in which the recipient, spouse, or child had any legal title or interest at the time of the recipient’s, spouse’s, or child’s death, to the extent of such interests, including but not limited to interests in jointly held property, retained life estates, and interests in trusts.\n\nd. For purposes of collection of a debt created by this subsection, all assets included in the estate of a medical assistance recipient, surviving spouse, or surviving child pursuant to paragraph “c” are subject to probate.\n\ne. Interest shall accrue on a debt due under this subsection, at the rate provided pursuant to section 535.3, beginning six months after the death of a medical assistance recipient, surviving spouse, or surviving child.\n\nf. (1) If a debt is due under this subsection from the estate of a recipient, the administrator of the nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, or mental health institute in which the recipient resided at the time of the recipient’s death, and the personal representative of the recipient, if applicable, shall report the death to the department within ten days of the death of the recipient.\n\n(2) If a personal representative or executor of an estate makes a distribution either in whole or in part of the property of an estate to the heirs, next of kin, distributees, legatees, or devisees without having executed the obligations pursuant to section 633.425, the personal representative or executor may be held personally liable for the amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the recipient, to the full value of any property belonging to the estate which may have been in the custody or control of the personal representative or executor.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this paragraph, “executor” means executor as defined in section 633.3, and “personal representative” means a person who filed a medical assistance application on behalf of the recipient or who manages the financial affairs of the recipient.\n\n3. a. Following the death of an individual who is a designated beneficiary of an account established under a participation agreement pursuant to chapter 12I, all of the following shall apply to the extent permitted pursuant to chapter 12I and under federal law including section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code:\n\n(1) The department shall not seek recovery of any account balance remaining in the designated beneficiary’s account for medical assistance paid to or on behalf of the designated beneficiary on or after the date the participation agreement was entered into and the account established for the designated beneficiary.\n\n(2) The department shall not file a claim for payment under section 529A(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(3) Any account balance remaining in the designated beneficiary’s account may be transferred to an account for another eligible individual specified by the designated beneficiary, or if another eligible beneficiary is not so designated, then the account balance shall be transferred to the estate of the designated beneficiary or to the successor as defined in section 633.356.\n\nb. For the purposes of this section, “designated beneficiary”, “Internal Revenue Code”, and “participation agreement” mean the same as defined in section 12I.1.\n\nc.

      "text": "249A.54 Responsibility for payment on behalf of Medicaid-eligible persons — liability of other parties.\n\n1. It is the intent of the general assembly that a Medicaid payor be the payor of last resort for medical services furnished to recipients. All other sources of payment for medical services are primary relative to medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor. If benefits of a third party are discovered or become available after medical assistance has been provided by the Medicaid payor, it is the intent of the general assembly that the Medicaid payor be repaid in full and prior to any other person, program, or entity. The Medicaid payor shall be repaid in full from and to the extent of any third-party benefits, regardless of whether a recipient is made whole or other creditors are paid.\n\n2. For the purposes of this section:\n\na. “Collateral” means all of the following:\n\n(1) Any and all causes of action, suits, claims, counterclaims, and demands that accrue to the recipient or to the recipient’s agent, related to any covered injury or illness, or medical services that necessitated that the Medicaid payor provide medical assistance to the recipient.\n\n(2) All judgments, settlements, and settlement agreements rendered or entered into and related to such causes of action, suits, claims, counterclaims, demands, or judgments.\n\n(3) Proceeds.\n\nb. “Covered injury or illness” means any sickness, injury, disease, disability, deformity, abnormality disease, necessary medical care, pregnancy, or death for which a third party is, may be, could be, should be, or has been liable, and for which the Medicaid payor is, or may be, obligated to provide, or has provided, medical assistance.\n\nc. “Medicaid payor” means the department or any person, entity, or organization that is legally responsible by contract, statute, or agreement to pay claims for medical assistance including but not limited to managed care organizations and other entities that contract with the state to provide medical assistance under chapter 249A.\n\nd. “Medical service” means medical or medically related institutional or noninstitutional care, or a medical or medically related institutional or noninstitutional good, item, or service covered by Medicaid.\n\ne. “Payment” as it relates to third-party benefits, means performance of a duty, promise, or obligation, or discharge of a debt or liability, by the delivery, provision, or transfer of third-party benefits for medical services. “To pay” means to make payment.\n\nf. “Proceeds” means whatever is received upon the sale, exchange, collection, or other disposition of the collateral or proceeds from the collateral and includes insurance payable because of loss or damage to the collateral or proceeds. “Cash proceeds” include money, checks, and deposit accounts and similar proceeds. All other proceeds are “noncash proceeds”.\n\ng. “Recipient” means a person who has applied for medical assistance or who has received medical assistance.\n\nh. “Recipient’s agent” includes a recipient’s legal guardian, legal representative, or any other person acting on behalf of the recipient.\n\ni. “Third party” means an individual, entity, or program, excluding Medicaid, that is or may be liable to pay all or a part of the expenditures for medical assistance provided by a Medicaid payor to the recipient. A third party includes but is not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) A third-party administrator.\n\n(2) A pharmacy benefits manager.\n\n(3) A health insurer.\n\n(4) A self-insured plan.\n\n(5) A group health plan, as defined in section 607(1) of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\n(6) A service benefit plan.\n\n(7) A managed care organization.\n\n(8) Liability insurance including self-insurance.\n\n(9) No-fault insurance.\n\n(10) Workers’ compensation laws or plans.\n\n(11) Other parties that by law, contract, or agreement are legally responsible for payment of a claim for medical services.\n\nj. “Third-party benefits” mean any benefits that are or may be available to a recipient from a third party and that provide or pay for medical services. “Third-party benefits” may be created by law, contract, court award, judgment, settlement, agreement, or any arrangement between a third party and any person or entity, recipient, or otherwise. “Third-party benefits” include but are not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) Benefits from collateral or proceeds.\n\n(2) Health insurance benefits.\n\n(3) Health maintenance organization benefits.\n\n(4) Benefits from preferred provider arrangements and prepaid health clinics.\n\n(5) Benefits from liability insurance, uninsured and underinsured motorist insurance, or personal injury protection coverage.\n\n(6) Medical benefits under workers’ compensation.\n\n(7) Benefits from any obligation under law or equity to provide medical support.\n\n3. Third-party benefits for medical services shall be primary to medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor.\n\n4. a. A Medicaid payor has all of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities identified under this section. Each Medicaid payor is a Medicaid payor to the extent of the medical assistance provided by that Medicaid payor. Therefore, Medicaid payors may exercise their Medicaid payor’s rights under this section concurrently.\n\nb. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, if the department determines that a Medicaid payor has not taken reasonable steps within a reasonable time to recover third-party benefits, the department may exercise all of the rights of the Medicaid payor under this section to the exclusion of the Medicaid payor. If the department determines the department will exercise such rights, the department shall give notice to third parties and to the Medicaid payor.\n\n5. A Medicaid payor may assign the Medicaid payor’s rights under this section, including but not limited to an assignment to another Medicaid payor, a provider, or a contractor.\n\n6. After the Medicaid payor has provided medical assistance under the Medicaid program, the Medicaid payor shall seek reimbursement for third-party benefits to the extent of the Medicaid payor’s legal liability and for the full amount of the third-party benefits, but not in excess of the amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor.\n\n7. On or before the thirtieth day following discovery by a recipient of potential third-party benefits, a recipient or the recipient’s agent, as applicable, shall inform the Medicaid payor of any rights the recipient has to third-party benefits and of the name and address of any person that is or may be liable to provide third-party benefits.\n\n8. When the Medicaid payor provides or becomes liable for medical assistance, the Medicaid payor has the following rights which shall be construed together to provide the greatest recovery of third-party benefits:\n\na. The Medicaid payor is automatically subrogated to any rights that a recipient or a recipient’s agent or legally liable relative has to any third-party benefit for the full amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor. Recovery pursuant to these subrogation rights shall not be reduced, prorated, or applied to only a portion of a judgment, award, or settlement, but shall provide full recovery to the Medicaid payor from any and all third-party benefits. Equities of a recipient or a recipient’s agent, creditor, or health care provider shall not defeat, reduce, or prorate recovery by the Medicaid payor as to the Medicaid payor’s subrogation rights granted under this paragraph.\n\nb. By applying for, accepting, or accepting the benefit of medical assistance, a recipient or a recipient’s agent or legally liable relative automatically assigns to the Medicaid payor any right, title, and interest such person has to any third-party benefit, excluding any Medicare benefit to the extent required to be excluded by federal law.\n\n(1) The assignment granted under this paragraph is absolute and vests legal and equitable title to any such right in the Medicaid payor, but not in excess of the amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor.\n\n(2) The Medicaid payor is a bona fide assignee for value in the assigned right, title, or interest and takes vested legal and equitable title free and clear of latent equities in a third party. Equities of a recipient or a recipient’s agent, creditor, or health care provider shall not defeat or reduce recovery by the Medicaid payor as to the assignment granted under this paragraph.\n\nc. The Medicaid payor is entitled to and has an automatic lien upon the collateral for the full amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor to or on behalf of the recipient for medical services furnished as a result of any covered injury or illness for which a third party is or may be liable.\n\n(1) The lien attaches automatically when a recipient first receives medical services for which the Medicaid payor may be obligated to provide medical assistance.\n\n(2) The filing of the notice of lien with the clerk of the district court in the county in which the recipient’s eligibility is established pursuant to this section shall be notice of the lien to all persons. Notice is effective as of the date of filing of the notice of lien.\n\n(3) If the Medicaid payor has actual knowledge that the recipient is represented by an attorney, the Medicaid payor shall provide the attorney with a copy of the notice of lien. However, this provision of a copy of the notice of lien to the recipient’s attorney does not abrogate the attachment, perfection, and notice satisfaction requirements specified under subparagraphs (1) and (2).\n\n(4) Only one claim of lien need be filed to provide notice and shall provide sufficient notice as to any additional or after-paid amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor for any specific covered injury or illness. The Medicaid payor may, in the Medicaid payor’s discretion, file additional, amended, or substitute notices of lien at any time after the initial filing until the Medicaid payor has been repaid the full amount of medical assistance provided by Medicaid or otherwise has released the liable parties and recipient.\n\n(5) A release or satisfaction of any cause of action, suit, claim, counterclaim, demand, judgment, settlement, or settlement agreement shall not be effective as against a lien created under this paragraph, unless the Medicaid payor joins in the release or satisfaction or executes a release of the lien. An acceptance of a release or satisfaction of any cause of action, suit, claim, counterclaim, demand, or judgment and any settlement of any of the foregoing in the absence of a release or satisfaction of a lien created under this paragraph shall prima facie constitute an impairment of the lien, and the Medicaid payor is entitled to recover damages on account of such impairment. In an action on account of impairment of a lien, the Medicaid payor may recover from the person accepting the release or satisfaction or the person making the settlement the full amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor.\n\n(6) The lack of a properly filed claim of lien shall not affect the Medicaid payor’s assignment or subrogation rights provided in this subsection nor affect the existence of the lien, but shall only affect the effective date of notice.\n\n(7) The lien created by this paragraph is a first lien and superior to the liens and charges of any provider of a recipient’s medical services. If the lien is recorded, the lien shall exist for a period of seven years after the date of recording. If the lien is not recorded, the lien shall exist for a period of seven years after the date of attachment. If recorded, the lien may be extended for one additional period of seven years by rerecording the claim of lien within the ninety-day period preceding the expiration of the lien.\n\n9. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Medicaid payor shall recover the full amount of all medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor on behalf of the recipient to the full extent of third-party benefits. The Medicaid payor may collect recovered benefits directly from any of the following:\n\na. A third party.\n\nb. The recipient.\n\nc. The provider of a recipient’s medical services if third-party benefits have been recovered by the provider. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a provider shall not be required to refund or pay to the Medicaid payor any amount in excess of the actual third-party benefits received by the provider from a third party for medical services provided to the recipient.\n\nd. Any person who has received the third-party benefits.\n\n10. a. A recipient and the recipient’s agent shall cooperate in the Medicaid payor’s recovery of the recipient’s third-party benefits and in establishing paternity and support of a recipient child born out of wedlock. Such cooperation shall include but is not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) Appearing at an office designated by the Medicaid payor to provide relevant information or evidence.\n\n(2) Appearing as a witness at a court proceeding or other legal or administrative proceeding.\n\n(3) Providing information or attesting to lack of information under penalty of perjury.\n\n(4) Paying to the Medicaid payor any third-party benefit received.\n\n(5) Taking any additional steps to assist in establishing paternity or securing third-party benefits, or both.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, the Medicaid payor has the discretion to waive, in writing, the requirement of cooperation for good cause shown and as required by federal law.\n\nc. The department may deny or terminate eligibility for any recipient who refuses to cooperate as required under this subsection unless the department has waived cooperation as provided under this subsection.\n\n11. On or before the thirtieth day following the initiation of a formal or informal recovery, other than by filing a lawsuit, a recipient’s attorney shall provide written notice of the activity or action to the Medicaid payor.\n\n12. A recipient is deemed to have authorized the Medicaid payor to obtain and release medical information and other records with respect to the recipient’s medical services for the sole purpose of obtaining reimbursement for medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor.\n\n13. a. To enforce the Medicaid payor’s rights under this section, the Medicaid payor may, as a matter of right, institute, intervene in, or join in any legal or administrative proceeding in the Medicaid payor’s own name, and in any or a combination of any, of the following capacities:\n\n(1) Individually.\n\n(2) As a subrogee of the recipient.\n\n(3) As an assignee of the recipient.\n\n(4) As a lienholder of the collateral.\n\nb. An action by the Medicaid payor to recover damages in an action in tort under this subsection, which action is derivative of the rights of the recipient, shall not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nc. A Medicaid payor, other than the department, shall obtain the written consent of the department before the Medicaid payor files a derivative legal action on behalf of a recipient.\n\nd. When a Medicaid payor brings a derivative legal action on behalf of a recipient, the Medicaid payor shall provide written notice no later than thirty days after filing the action to the recipient, the recipient’s agent, and, if the Medicaid payor has actual knowledge that the recipient is represented by an attorney, to the attorney of the recipient, as applicable.\n\ne. If the recipient or a recipient’s agent brings an action against a third party, on or before the thirtieth day following the filing of the action, the recipient, the recipient’s agent, or the attorney of the recipient or the recipient’s agent, as applicable, shall provide written notice to the Medicaid payor of the action, including the name of the court in which the action is brought, the case number of the action, and a copy of the pleadings. The recipient, the recipient’s agent, or the attorney of the recipient or the recipient’s agent, as applicable, shall provide written notice of intent to dismiss the action at least twenty-one days before the voluntary dismissal of an action against a third party. Notice to the Medicaid payor shall be sent as specified by rule.\n\n14. On or before the thirtieth day before the recipient finalizes a judgment, award, settlement, or any other recovery where the Medicaid payor has the right to recovery, the recipient, the recipient’s agent, or the attorney of the recipient or recipient’s agent, as applicable, shall give the Medicaid payor notice of the judgment, award, settlement, or recovery. The judgment, award, settlement, or recovery shall not be finalized unless such notice is provided and the Medicaid payor has had a reasonable opportunity to recover under the Medicaid payor’s rights to subrogation, assignment, and lien. If the Medicaid payor is not given notice, the recipient, the recipient’s agent, and the recipient’s or recipient’s agent’s attorney are jointly and severally liable to reimburse the Medicaid payor for the recovery received to the extent of medical assistance paid by the Medicaid payor. The notice required under this subsection means written notice sent via certified mail to the address listed on the department’s internet site for a Medicaid payor’s third-party liability contact. The notice requirement is only satisfied for the specific Medicaid payor upon receipt by the specific Medicaid payor’s third-party liability contact of such written notice sent via certified mail.\n\n15. a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the entire amount of any settlement of the recipient’s action or claim involving third-party benefits, with or without suit, is subject to the Medicaid payor’s claim for reimbursement of the amount of medical assistance provided and any lien pursuant to the claim.\n\nb. Insurance and other third-party benefits shall not contain any term or provision which purports to limit or exclude payment or the provision of benefits for an individual if the individual is eligible for, or a recipient of, medical assistance, and any such term or provision shall be void as against public policy.\n\n16. In an action in tort against a third party in which the recipient is a party and which results in a judgment, award, or settlement from a third party, the amount recovered shall be distributed as follows:\n\na. After deduction of reasonable attorney fees, reasonably necessary legal expenses, and filing fees, there is a rebuttable presumption that all Medicaid payors shall collectively receive two-thirds of the remaining amount recovered or the total amount of medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payors, whichever is less. A party may rebut this presumption in accordance with subsection 17.\n\nb. The remaining recovered amount shall be paid to the recipient.\n\nc. If the recovered amount available for the repayment of medical assistance is insufficient to satisfy the competing claims of the Medicaid payors, each Medicaid payor shall be entitled to the Medicaid payor’s respective pro rata share of the recovered amount that is available.\n\n17. a. A recipient or a recipient’s agent who has notice or who has actual knowledge of the Medicaid payor’s rights to third-party benefits under this section and who receives any third-party benefit or proceeds for a covered injury or illness shall on or before the sixtieth day after receipt of the proceeds pay the Medicaid payor the full amount of the third-party benefits, but not more than the total medical assistance provided by the Medicaid payor, or shall place the full amount of the third-party benefits in an interest-bearing trust account for the benefit of the Medicaid payor pending a determination of the Medicaid payor’s rights to the benefits under this subsection.\n\nb. If federal law limits the Medicaid payor to reimbursement from the recovered damages for medical expenses, a recipient may contest the amount designated as recovered damages for medical expenses payable to the Medicaid payor pursuant to the formula specified in subsection 16. In order to successfully rebut the formula specified in subsection 16, the recipient shall prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the portion of the total recovery which should be allocated as medical expenses, including future medical expenses, is less than the amount calculated by the Medicaid payor pursuant to the formula specified in subsection 16. Alternatively, to successfully rebut the formula specified in subsection 16, the recipient shall prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Medicaid provided a lesser amount of medical assistance than that asserted by the Medicaid payor. A settlement agreement that designates the amount of recovered damages for medical expenses is not clear and convincing evidence and is not sufficient to establish the recipient’s burden of proof, unless the Medicaid payor is a party to the settlement agreement.\n\nc. If the recipient or the recipient’s agent filed a legal action to recover against the third party, the court in which such action was filed shall resolve any dispute concerning the amount owed to the Medicaid payor, and shall retain jurisdiction of the case to resolve the amount of the lien after the dismissal of the action.\n\nd. If the recipient or the recipient’s agent did not file a legal action, to resolve any dispute concerning the amount owed to the Medicaid payor, the recipient or the recipient’s agent shall file a petition for declaratory judgment as permitted under\n\nrule of civil procedure 1.1101\n\non or before the one hundred twenty-first day after the date of payment of funds to the Medicaid payor or the date of placing the full amount of the third-party benefits in a trust account. Venue for all declaratory actions under this subsection shall lie in Polk county.\n\ne. If a Medicaid payor and the recipient or the recipient’s agent disagree as to whether a medical claim is related to a covered injury or illness, the Medicaid payor and the recipient or the recipient’s agent shall attempt to work cooperatively to resolve the disagreement before seeking resolution by the court.\n\nf. Each party shall pay the party’s own attorney fees and costs for any legal action conducted under this subsection.\n\n18. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, when medical assistance is provided for a minor, any statute of limitation or repose applicable to an action or claim of a legally responsible relative for the minor’s medical expenses is extended in favor of the legally responsible relative so that the legally responsible relative shall have one year from and after the attainment of the minor’s majority within which to file a complaint, make a claim, or commence an action.\n\n19. In recovering any payments in accordance with this section, the Medicaid payor may make appropriate settlements.\n\n20. If a recipient or a recipient’s agent submits via notice a request that the Medicaid payor provide an itemization of medical assistance paid for any covered injury or illness, the Medicaid payor shall provide the itemization on or before the sixty-fifth day following the day on which the Medicaid payor received the request. Failure to provide the itemization within the specified time shall not bar a Medicaid payor’s recovery, unless the itemization response is delinquent for more than one hundred twenty days without justifiable cause. A Medicaid payor shall not be under any obligation to provide a final itemization until a reasonable period of time after the processing of payment in relation to the recipient’s receipt of final medical services. A Medicaid payor shall not be under any obligation to respond to more than one itemization request in any one-hundred-twenty-day period. The notice required under this subsection means written notice sent via certified mail to the address listed on the department’s internet site for a Medicaid payor’s third-party liability contact. The notice requirement is only satisfied for the specific Medicaid payor upon receipt by the specific Medicaid payor’s third-party liability contact of such written notice sent via certified mail.\n\n21. The department may adopt rules to administer this section and applicable federal requirements.\n\n[C79, 81, §249A.6]\n\n83 Acts, ch 120, §1; 83 Acts, ch 153, §15; 89 Acts, ch 111, §1; 93 Acts, ch 180, §50; 94 Acts, ch 1023, §89; 2008 Acts, ch 1014, §2; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §244; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §96; 2013 Acts, ch 24, §14\n\nC2014, §249A.54\n\n2023 Acts, ch 158, §2\n\nReferred to in §249A.37\n\nSection stricken and rewritten",
