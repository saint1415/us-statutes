The clerk shall file foreign protective orders that are not certified or authenticated, if supported by an affidavit of a person with personal knowledge, subject to the penalties for perjury.

Proof that a foreign protective order failed to meet all of the factors listed in paragraph “b” shall be an affirmative defense in any action seeking enforcement of the order.\n\n4. A peace officer shall treat a foreign protective order as a valid legal document and shall make an arrest for a violation of the foreign protective order in the same manner that a peace officer would make an arrest for a violation of a protective order issued within this state.\n\na. The fact that a foreign protective order has not been filed with the clerk of court or otherwise placed in a registry shall not be grounds to refuse to enforce the terms of the order unless it is apparent to the officer that the order is invalid on its face.\n\nb.
