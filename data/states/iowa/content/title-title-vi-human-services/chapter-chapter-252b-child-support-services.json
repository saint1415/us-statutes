The director, within the limitations of the amount appropriated for child support services, or moneys transferred for this purpose from the family investment program account created in section 239B.11, may establish new positions and add employees to child support services if the director determines that both the current and additional employees together can reasonably be expected to maintain or increase net state revenue at or beyond the budgeted level for the fiscal year.\n\n2. a. The director may establish new positions and add state employees to child support services or contract for delivery of services if the director determines the employees are necessary to replace county-funded positions eliminated due to termination, reduction, or nonrenewal of a chapter 28E contract. However, the director must also determine that the resulting increase in the state share of child support services incentives exceeds the cost of the positions or contract, the positions or contract are necessary to ensure continued federal funding of child support services, or the new positions or contract can reasonably be expected to recover at least twice the amount of money necessary to pay the salaries and support for the new positions or the contract will generate at least two hundred percent of the cost of the contract.\n\nb.
