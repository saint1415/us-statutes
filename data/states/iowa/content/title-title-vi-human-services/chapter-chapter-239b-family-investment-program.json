At a minimum, a family shall meet all of the following conditions of eligibility:\n\n1. Application. An application for the program is made to the department. The application shall be in writing or reduced to writing in the manner and upon the form prescribed by the department. The application shall be made by the specified relative with whom the child resides or will reside, and shall contain the information required on the application form. One application may be made for several children of the same family if the children reside or will reside with the same specified relative.\n\n2. Income and resources.

In determining a family’s income and resources, the department shall consider the income and resources of the child, the child’s parent, the child’s stepparent living with the child, or any other specified relative with whom the child resides or will reside available to the family unless specifically exempted as provided in section 239B.7 or by rule or unless otherwise provided by federal law. A family’s failure to meet the income or resource guidelines shall result in denial of the family’s eligibility for the program.\n\n3. Unemployment.\n\na. A determination of eligibility for a family with an unemployed parent shall not include consideration of either parent’s number of hours of employment. Both parents must enter into and participate in a family investment agreement and participate in JOBS program activities unless good cause not to participate is established in accordance with rules.\n\nb. Any of the following reasons for refusing employment or training are not good cause:\n\n(1) Unsuitable or unpleasant work or training, if the parent is able to perform the work or training without unusual danger to the parent’s health.\n\n(2) The amount of wages or compensation, unless the wages for employment are below the amount customary for the same work in the community.\n\n4. Written statement — family investment agreement.\n\na. The department may require an applicant family to commit to the initial actions the applicant family will take to achieve self-sufficiency as contained in a signed, written statement. An applicant family which fails to commit to the actions as contained in the written statement shall be denied eligibility for the family investment program.

      "text": "239B.9 Limited benefit plan.\n\n1. General provisions.\n\na. If a participant responsible for signing and fulfilling the terms of a family investment agreement, as defined by the director in accordance with section 239B.8, chooses not to sign or fulfill the terms of the agreement, the participant’s family, or the individual participant shall enter into a limited benefit plan. Initial actions in a written statement under section 239B.2, subsection 4, which were committed to by a participant during the application period and which commitment remains in effect, shall be considered to be a term of the participant’s family investment agreement. A limited benefit plan shall apply for the period of time specified in this section. The first month of the limited benefit plan is the first month after the month in which timely and adequate notice of the limited benefit plan is given to the participant as defined by the director. The elements of a limited benefit plan shall be specified in the department’s rules.\n\nb. For purposes of this lettered paragraph, “significant contact with or action in regard to the JOBS program” means the individual participant communicates to the JOBS program worker the desire to engage in JOBS program activities, signs a new or updated family investment agreement, and takes any other action required by the department in accordance with rules adopted for this purpose. A limited benefit plan applied in error shall not be considered to have been applied. A limited benefit plan is applicable to the individual participant choosing the limited benefit plan and to the individual participant’s family members to which the plan is applicable under subsection 2. A limited benefit plan shall either be a first limited benefit plan or a subsequent limited benefit plan. A limited benefit plan shall be applied as follows:\n\n(1) A first limited benefit plan shall provide for continuing ineligibility for assistance until the individual participant completes significant contact with or action in regard to the JOBS program.\n\n(2) A limited benefit plan subsequent to a first limited benefit plan chosen by the same individual participant shall provide for a specified period of ineligibility of six months or less beginning with the effective date of the limited benefit plan and continuing indefinitely following the specified period until the individual participant completes significant contact with or action in regard to the JOBS program. The department shall adopt rules defining the circumstances for which a particular period of ineligibility will be specified.\n\n(3) For a two-parent family in which both parents are responsible for a family investment agreement, a first or subsequent limited benefit plan shall remain applicable until both parents complete significant contact with or action in regard to the JOBS program. A limited benefit plan applied more than once to the same two-parent family shall be treated as a subsequent limited benefit plan.\n\n2. Plan applied. The department shall apply the limited benefit plan to the participants responsible for the family investment agreement and other members of the participant’s family as follows:\n\na. Parent. If the participant responsible for the family investment agreement is a parent, the limited benefit plan is applicable to the entire participant family.\n\nb. Needy relative or incapacitated stepparent. If the participant choosing a limited benefit plan is a needy relative who acts as payee when the parent is in the home but is unable to act as payee, is a needy relative who assumes the role of parent, or is a dependent child’s stepparent whose needs are included in the assistance because of incapacity, the limited benefit plan shall apply only to the individual participant choosing the plan.\n\nc. Minor parent living with adult parent or specified relative. If the participant family includes a minor parent living with the minor parent’s adult parent or specified relative who receives family investment program assistance and both individuals are responsible for developing a family investment agreement, each individual is responsible for a separate family investment agreement, and the limited benefit plan shall be applied as follows:\n\n(1) If the adult parent chooses the limited benefit plan, the requirements of the limited benefit plan shall apply to the entire participant family, even though the minor parent has not chosen the limited benefit plan. However, the minor parent may reapply for assistance as a minor parent living with self-supporting parents or living independently and continue in the family investment agreement process.\n\n(2) If the minor parent chooses the limited benefit plan, the requirements of the limited benefit plan shall apply to the minor parent and any child of the minor parent.\n\n(3) If the specified relative chooses the limited benefit plan, the requirements of the limited benefit plan shall apply only to the specified relative.\n\nd. Minor parent — only child. If the minor parent is the only child in the adult parent’s or specified relative’s home and the minor parent chooses the limited benefit plan, assistance shall not be paid to the adult parent or specified relative in this instance.\n\ne. Children who are mandatory JOBS program participants. If the participant family includes children who are mandatory JOBS program participants, the children shall not have a separate family investment agreement but shall be asked to sign the family investment agreement applicable to the family and to carry out the responsibilities of that family investment agreement. A limited benefit plan shall be applied as follows:\n\n(1) If the parent or specified relative responsible for a family investment agreement meets the responsibilities of the family investment agreement but a child who is a mandatory JOBS program participant chooses an individual limited benefit plan, the family is eligible for reduced assistance during the child’s limited benefit plan.\n\n(2) If the child who chooses a limited benefit plan under subparagraph (1) is the only child in the participant family, assistance shall not be paid to the adult parent, parents, or specified relative in this instance.\n\nf. Exempt parent. If a participant family includes a parent, parents, or specified relative who are exempt from JOBS program participation and children who are mandatory JOBS program participants, the children are responsible for completing a family investment agreement. If a child who is a mandatory JOBS program participant chooses the limited benefit plan, the limited benefit plan shall be applied in the manner provided in paragraph “e”.\n\ng. Two parents. If the participant family includes two parents, a limited benefit plan shall be applied as follows:\n\n(1) If only one parent of a child in the family is responsible for a family investment agreement and that parent chooses the limited benefit plan, the limited benefit plan cannot be ended by the voluntary participation in a family investment agreement by the exempt parent. If the parent responsible for the family investment agreement chooses a limited benefit plan, the limited benefit plan applies to the entire family.\n\n(2) If both parents of a child in the family are responsible for a family investment agreement, both parents shall sign the agreement. If either parent chooses the limited benefit plan, the limited benefit plan cannot be ended by the participation of the other parent in a family investment agreement.\n\n(3) If the parents from a two-parent family in a limited benefit plan separate, the limited benefit plan shall follow only the parent who chose the limited benefit plan and any children in the home of that parent.\n\n3. Plan chosen. A participant shall be considered to have chosen a limited benefit plan under any of the following circumstances:\n\na. A participant who does not establish an orientation appointment with the JOBS program or who fails to keep or reschedule an orientation appointment shall receive a reminder letter which informs the participant that those who do not attend orientation have elected to choose a limited benefit plan. A participant who chooses not to respond to the reminder letter within ten calendar days from the mailing date shall receive notice establishing the effective date of the limited benefit plan. If a participant is deemed to have chosen a limited benefit plan, timely and adequate notice provisions, as determined by the director, shall apply.\n\nb. A participant who chooses not to sign the family investment agreement after attending a JOBS program orientation shall enter into a limited benefit plan as described in paragraph “a”.\n\nc. A participant who has signed a family investment agreement but then chooses a limited benefit plan under circumstances defined by the director.\n\n4. Reconsideration. A participant who chooses a limited benefit plan may reconsider that choice as follows:\n\na. A participant who chooses a first limited benefit plan may reconsider at any time following the effective date of the limited benefit plan. The participant may contact the department or the appropriate JOBS program office any time to begin the reconsideration process.\n\nb. A participant who chooses a subsequent limited benefit plan may reconsider that choice at any time following the period of ineligibility specified in accordance with subsection 1.\n\n5. Well-being visit. If a participant has chosen a subsequent limited benefit plan, the department may conduct a well-being visit or contract for a well-being visit to be conducted, provided funding is available for the costs of such visits. A well-being visit shall meet all of the following criteria:\n\na. A qualified professional shall attempt to visit with the participant family with a focus upon the children’s well-being.\n\nb. The visit shall be conducted during or within four weeks of the second month of the start of the subsequent limited benefit plan.\n\nc. The visit shall serve as an extension of the family investment program and the family investment agreement philosophy of supporting families as they move toward self-sufficiency.\n\n6. Appeal. A participant has the right to appeal the establishment of the limited benefit plan only once, at the time the department issues the timely and adequate notice that establishes the limited benefit plan. However, if the reason for the appeal is based on an incorrect grant computation, an error in determining the composition of the family, or another worker error, a hearing shall be granted, regardless of the person’s limited benefit plan status.\n\n97 Acts, ch 41, §10, 34; 98 Acts, ch 1218, §55 – 60; 99 Acts, ch 100, §3; 2000 Acts, ch 1088, §4; 2002 Acts, ch 1015, §1, 4; 2004 Acts, ch 1043, §4; 2006 Acts, ch 1016, §9 – 11; 2008 Acts, ch 1111, §1, 2; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §783, 784\n\nReferred to in §239B.1, 239B.8\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph a amended\n\nSubsection 3, paragraphs a and c amended",
