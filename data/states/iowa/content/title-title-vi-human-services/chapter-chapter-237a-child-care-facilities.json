The capacity requirements shall take into consideration the provider’s own children, children who have a mild illness, children receiving part-time child care, and children served as a sibling group in overnight care.\n\nb. The rules shall allow a child development home to be registered in a particular category for which the provider is qualified even though the amount of space required to be available for the maximum number of children authorized for that category exceeds the actual amount of space available in that home.

Otherwise, the individual shall not be employed by the child care facility or child care home.\n\nc. Unless a record check has already been conducted in accordance with paragraph “b”, the record check evaluation system shall conduct a criminal and child abuse record check in this state for a person who is subject to a record check and may conduct such a check in other states. In addition, the record check evaluation system may conduct a dependent adult abuse, sex offender registry, or other public or civil offense record check in this state or in other states for a person who is subject to a record check.\n\nd. (1) For a person subject to a record check, in addition to any other record check conducted pursuant to this subsection, the person’s fingerprints shall be provided to the department of public safety for submission through the state criminal history repository to the United States department of justice, federal bureau of investigation for a national criminal history check. The department may adopt rules specifying criteria in the public interest for requiring the national criminal history check of a person to be repeated.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided by law, the cost of a national criminal history check conducted in accordance with subparagraph (1) and the state record checks conducted in accordance with paragraph “c” that are conducted in connection with a person’s involvement with a child care center are not the responsibility of the department. The department is responsible for the cost of such checks conducted in connection with a person’s involvement with a child development home or child care home.\n\n(3) If record checks under paragraph “b” or “c” have been conducted on a person subject to a record check and the results do not warrant prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care or otherwise present protective concerns, the person may be involved with child care on a provisional basis until the record check under subparagraph (1) has been completed.\n\n(4) If a person subject to a record check refuses to consent to a record check or if the person makes what the person knows to be a false statement of material fact in connection with a record check, the person shall be prohibited from involvement with child care.\n\ne. (1) If a record check performed pursuant to this subsection identifies an individual as a person subject to an evaluation, an evaluation shall be performed to determine whether prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care is warranted. The evaluation shall be performed in accordance with procedures adopted for this purpose by the department.\n\n(2) Prior to performing an evaluation, the record check evaluation system shall notify the affected person, licensee, registrant, or child care home applying for or receiving public funding for providing child care, that an evaluation will be conducted to determine whether prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care is warranted.\n\nf. If a record check performed in accordance with paragraph “b” or “c” identifies that an individual is a person subject to an evaluation, the record check evaluation system shall perform the evaluation in accordance with this subsection, even if the application which made the person subject to the record check is withdrawn or the circumstances which made the person subject to the record check are no longer applicable. If the record check evaluation system’s evaluation determines that prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care is warranted, the provisions of this subsection regarding such a prohibition shall apply.\n\ng. A person subject to a record check who is or was employed by a child care facility or child care home provider and is hired by another child care facility or child care home provider shall be subject to a record check in accordance with this subsection. However, if the person was subject to an evaluation because of a transgression in the person’s record and the evaluation determined that the transgression did not warrant prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care and the latest record checks do not indicate there is a transgression that was committed subsequent to that evaluation, the person may commence employment with the other child care facility or provider in accordance with the evaluation and an exemption from any requirements for reevaluation of the latest record checks is authorized. Authorization of an exemption under this paragraph “g” from requirements for reevaluation of the latest record checks by the record check evaluation system is subject to all of the following provisions:\n\n(1) The position with the subsequent employer is substantially the same or has the same job responsibilities as the position for which the previous evaluation was performed.\n\n(2) Any restrictions placed on the person’s employment in the previous evaluation by the record check evaluation system shall remain applicable in the person’s subsequent employment.\n\n(3) The person subject to the record checks has maintained a copy of the previous evaluation and provides the evaluation to the subsequent employer or the previous employer provides the previous evaluation from the person’s personnel file pursuant to the person’s authorization. If a physical copy of the previous evaluation is not provided to the subsequent employer, the record checks shall be reevaluated.\n\n(4) Although an exemption under this paragraph “g” may be authorized, the subsequent employer may instead request a reevaluation of the record checks and may employ the person while the reevaluation is being performed.\n\nh. In an evaluation, the record check evaluation system shall consider the nature and seriousness of the transgression in relation to the position sought or held, the time elapsed since the commission of the transgression, the circumstances under which the transgression was committed, the degree of rehabilitation, the likelihood that the person will commit the transgression again, and the number of transgressions committed by the person involved. In addition to record check information, the record check evaluation system may utilize information from the record check evaluation system’s case records in performing the evaluation. The record check evaluation system may permit a person who is evaluated to maintain involvement with child care, if the person complies with the record check evaluation system’s conditions and corrective action plan relating to the person’s involvement with child care. The record check evaluation system has final authority in determining whether prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care is warranted and in developing any conditional requirements and corrective action plan under this paragraph.\n\ni. (1) A person subject to an evaluation shall be prohibited from involvement with child care under any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) The person has a record of founded child abuse or dependent adult abuse that was determined to be sexual abuse.\n\n(b) The person is listed or is required to be listed on any state sex offender registry or the national sex offender registry.\n\n(c) The person has committed any of the following felony-level offenses:\n\n(i) Child endangerment or neglect or abandonment of a dependent person.\n\n(ii) Domestic abuse.\n\n(iii) A crime against a child including but not limited to sexual exploitation of a minor.\n\n(iv) A forcible felony.\n\n(d) The person has a record of a misdemeanor conviction against a child that constitutes one of the following offenses:\n\n(i) Child abuse.\n\n(ii) Child endangerment.\n\n(iii) Sexual assault.\n\n(iv) Child pornography.\n\n(2) If, within five years prior to the date of application for registration or licensure under this chapter, for employment or residence in a child care facility or child care home, or for receipt of public funding for providing child care, a person subject to an evaluation has been convicted of a controlled substance offense or has been found to have committed physical abuse, the person shall be prohibited from involvement with child care for a period of five years from the date of conviction or founded abuse. After the five-year prohibition period, the person may submit an application for registration or licensure under this chapter, or to receive public funding for providing child care, or may request an evaluation, and the record check evaluation system shall perform an evaluation and, based upon the criteria in paragraph “h”, shall determine whether prohibition of the person’s involvement with child care continues to be warranted.\n\nj. If the record check evaluation system determines, through an evaluation of a person’s transgression, that the person’s prohibition of involvement with child care is warranted, the person shall be prohibited from involvement with child care. The record check evaluation system may identify a period of time after which the person may request that another record check and evaluation be performed. A person who continues involvement with child care in violation of this subsection is subject to penalty under section 237A.19 or injunction under section 237A.20.\n\nk. If it has been determined that a child receiving child care from a child care facility or a child care home is the victim of founded child abuse committed by an employee, license or registration holder, child care home provider, or resident of the child care facility or child care home for which a report is placed in the central registry pursuant to section 232.71D, the department shall provide notification at the time of the determination to the parents, guardians, and custodians of children receiving care from the child care facility or child care home. A notification made under this paragraph shall identify the type of abuse but shall not identify the victim or perpetrator or circumstances of the founded abuse.\n\n3. A licensee or registrant shall inform all new applicants for employment of the possibility of the performance of a record check and shall obtain, from the applicant, a signed acknowledgment of the receipt of the information.\n\n4. A licensee or registrant shall include the following inquiry in an application for employment:\n\nDo you have a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse or have you ever been convicted of a crime, in this state or any other state?\n\n5. A person who serves as an unpaid volunteer in a child care facility shall not be required to complete training as a mandatory reporter of child abuse under section 232.69 or under any other requirement.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §237A.5]\n\n83 Acts, ch 153, §5; 85 Acts, ch 184, §1; 87 Acts, ch 153, §17; 88 Acts, ch 1134, §58; 90 Acts, ch 1221, §8; 91 Acts, ch 138, §8; 94 Acts, ch 1130, §15; 97 Acts, ch 45, §1; 98 Acts, ch 1127, §3, 6; 99 Acts, ch 192, §13; 2003 Acts, ch 81, §5, 6; 2006 Acts, ch 1098, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1184, §108 – 111; 2008 Acts, ch 1187, §121; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §99; 2009 Acts, ch 179, §209; 2010 Acts, ch 1042, §1; 2012 Acts, ch 1074, §2; 2018 Acts, ch 1113, §2, 3; 2019 Acts, ch 59, §73; 2022 Acts, ch 1066, §39; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §742\n\nReferred to in §237A.19\n\nSection amended",

Subject to the provisions of chapter 17A, the department shall adopt rules setting minimum standards to provide quality child care in the operation and maintenance of child care centers and registered child development homes, relating to all of the following:\n\na. The number and qualifications of personnel necessary to assure the health, safety, and welfare of children in the facilities. Rules for facilities which are preschools shall be drawn so that any staff-to-children ratios which relate to the age of the children enrolled shall be based on the age of the majority of the children served by a particular class rather than on the age of the youngest child served.\n\nb. Physical facilities.\n\nc. The adequacy of activity programs and food services available to the children. The department shall not restrict the use of or apply nutritional standards to a lunch or other meal which is brought to the center, child development home, or child care home by a school-age child for the child’s consumption.\n\nd. Policies established by the center for parental participation.\n\ne. Programs for education and in-service training of staff.\n\nf. Records kept by the facilities.\n\ng. Administration.\n\nh. Health, safety, and medical policies for children.\n\n2. Rules adopted by the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing for buildings, other than school buildings, used as child care centers as an adjunct to the primary purpose of the building shall take into consideration that children are received for temporary care only and shall not differ from rules adopted for these buildings when they are used by groups of persons congregating from time to time in the primary use and occupancy of the buildings. However, the rules may require a fire-rated separation from the remaining portion of the building if the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing determines that the separation is necessary for the protection of children from a specific flammable hazard.\n\n3. Rules relating to fire safety for child care centers shall be adopted under this chapter by the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing in consultation with the department. Rules adopted by the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing for a building which is owned or leased by a school district or accredited nonpublic school and used as a child care facility shall not differ from standards adopted by the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing for school buildings under chapter 10A, subchapter V, part 2. Rules relating to sanitation shall be adopted by the department. All rules shall be developed in consultation with the state child care advisory committee. The director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing shall inspect the facilities.\n\n4. If a building is owned or leased by a school district or accredited nonpublic school and complies with standards adopted by the director of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing for school buildings under chapter 10A, subchapter V, part 2, the building is considered appropriate for use by a child care facility. The rules adopted by the department under this section shall not require the facility to comply with building requirements which differ from requirements for use of the building as a school.\n\n5. Standards and requirements set by a city or county for a building which is owned or leased by a school district or accredited nonpublic school and used as a child care facility shall take into consideration that children are received for temporary care only and shall not differ from standards and requirements set for use of the building as a school.\n\n6.

A state child care assistance program is established in the department to assist children in families who meet eligibility guidelines and are described by any of the following circumstances:\n\na. The child’s parent, guardian, or custodian is participating in approved academic, vocational, or technical training.\n\nb. The child’s parent, guardian, or custodian is seeking employment. Eligibility for assistance while seeking employment shall be limited to thirty days during a twelve-month period.\n\nc. The child’s parent, guardian, or custodian is employed a minimum of thirty-two hours per week or an average of thirty-two hours per week during the month if the child requires basic care, or twenty-eight hours per week or an average of twenty-eight hours per week during the month if the child is a special needs child.\n\nd. The child’s parent, guardian, or custodian is absent due to hospitalization, physical illness, or mental illness, or is present but is unable to care for the child as verified by a physician or physician assistant.\n\ne. The child needs protective services to prevent or alleviate child abuse or neglect.\n\nf. The person’s family circumstances are described in paragraph “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”, the person is thirteen years of age or older but younger than sixteen years of age, and state child care assistance is approved for the person by the director or the director’s designee based on a request for an exception to policy made by the person’s parent, guardian, or custodian because special family circumstances exist that would place the safety and well-being of the person at risk if the person is left home alone. The definition of child in section 237A.1 does not apply to child care supported by state child care assistance approved pursuant to this lettered paragraph.\n\n2. A family shall only be initially eligible for state child care assistance if the family’s gross monthly income does not exceed the lesser of:\n\na.

The department shall conduct a statewide reimbursement rate survey to compile information on each county and the survey shall be conducted at least every two years. The department shall set rates in a manner so as to provide incentives for an unregistered provider to become registered.\n\nb. The department shall not modify reimbursement rates to the state child care assistance program or financial eligibility requirements for a family participating in the state child care assistance program without prior enabling legislation in this state passed on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n5. The department’s billing and payment provisions for the program shall allow providers to elect either biweekly or monthly billing and payment for child care provided under the program. The department shall remit payment to a provider within ten business days of receiving a bill or claim for services provided. However, if the department determines that a bill has an error or omission, the department shall notify the provider of the error or omission and identify any correction needed before issuance of payment to the provider. The department shall provide the notice within five business days of receiving the billing from the provider and shall remit payment to the provider within ten business days of receiving the corrected billing.\n\n6. A child care provider shall be allowed to collect from a family participating in the state child care assistance program the difference between the state child care assistance reimbursement rate and the rate the provider would typically charge a private-pay family for child care, provided the child care provider and family agree in writing to such additional payments prior to the provision of the child care.\n\n7. On or before July 1, 2007, the department shall implement a system for making program payments by electronic funds transfer or other electronic means.\n\n8. The department shall not apply waiting list requirements to any of the following persons:\n\na. Persons deemed to be eligible for benefits under the state child care assistance program in accordance with section 239B.24.\n\nb. A family that is receiving state child care assistance at the time a child is born into the family. The newborn child shall be approved for services when the family reports the birth of the child.\n\nc. Children who need protective services to prevent or alleviate child abuse or neglect.\n\nd. A child in a family that is eligible for state child care assistance and that receives a state adoption subsidy for the child.\n\n9. Based upon the availability of the funding appropriated for state child care assistance for a fiscal year, the department shall establish waiting lists for state child care assistance in descending order of prioritization as follows:\n\na. Families with an income at or below one hundred percent of the federal poverty level whose members, for at least thirty-two hours per week in the aggregate, are employed or are participating at a satisfactory level in an approved training program or educational program, and parents with a family income at or below one hundred percent of the federal poverty level who are under the age of twenty-one years and are participating in an educational program leading to a high school diploma or the equivalent.\n\nb. Parents with a family income at or below one hundred percent of the federal poverty level who are under the age of twenty-one years and are participating, at a satisfactory level, in an approved training program or in an educational program.\n\nc. Families with an income of more than one hundred percent but not more than one hundred sixty percent of the federal poverty level whose members, for at least thirty-two hours per week in the aggregate, are employed or are participating at a satisfactory level in an approved training program or educational program.\n\nd. Families with an income at or below two hundred percent of the federal poverty level whose members are employed at least twenty-eight hours per week with a special needs child as a member of the family.\n\n10. Nothing in this section shall be construed as or is intended as, or shall imply, a grant of entitlement for services to persons who are eligible for assistance due to an income level or other eligibility circumstance addressed in this section.

For the purposes of this subsection, “fraudulent means” means knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement or a misrepresentation of a material fact, knowingly failing to disclose a material fact, or committing a fraudulent practice.\n\nb. A child care provider that has been found by the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing in an administrative proceeding or in a judicial proceeding to have obtained, or has agreed to entry of a civil judgment or judgment by confession that includes a conclusion of law that the child care provider has obtained, by fraudulent means, public funding for provision of child care in an amount equal to or in excess of the minimum amount for a fraudulent practice in the second degree under section 714.10, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, shall be subject to sanction in accordance with this subsection. Such child care provider shall be subject to a period during which receipt of public funding for provision of child care is conditioned upon no further violations and to one or more of the following sanctions as determined by the department:\n\n(1) Ineligibility to receive public funding for provision of child care.\n\n(2) Suspension from receipt of public funding for provision of child care.\n\n(3) Special review of the child care provider’s claims for providing publicly funded child care.\n\nc.

If a child care provider is subject to sanctions under subsection 2, within five business days of the date the sanctions are imposed, the provider shall submit to the department the names and addresses of children receiving child care from the provider. The department shall send information to the parents of the children regarding the provider’s actions leading to the imposition of the sanctions and the nature of the sanctions imposed.\n\nb.
