If an assistive device does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, the assistive device lessor, or any of the manufacturer’s authorized assistive device dealers, and makes the assistive device available for repair before one year after first delivery of the device to the consumer or within the period of the express warranty if the warranty is longer than one year, a reasonable attempt to repair the nonconformity shall be made.\n\n2. If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall carry out the requirements of either paragraph “a” or “b” upon the request of a consumer.\n\na. The manufacturer shall provide for a refund by doing one of the following:\n\n(1) If the assistive device was purchased by the consumer, accept return of the assistive device and refund to the consumer and to any holder of perfected security interest in the consumer’s assistive device, as the holder’s interest may appear, the full purchase price plus any finance charge paid by the consumer at the point of sale and collateral costs, less a reasonable allowance for use.\n\n(2) If the assistive device was leased by the consumer, accept return of the assistive device, refund to the assistive device lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive device, as the holder’s interest may appear, the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer the amount that the consumer paid under the written lease plus any collateral costs, less a reasonable allowance for use. The manufacturer shall have a cause of action against the dealer or lessor for reimbursement of any amount that the manufacturer pays to a consumer which exceeds the net price received by the manufacturer for the assistive device.\n\nb. The manufacturer shall provide a comparable new assistive device or offer a refund to the consumer if the consumer does any one of the following:\n\n(1) Offers to transfer possession of the assistive device to the manufacturer. No later than thirty days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with the comparable new assistive device or a refund. When the manufacturer provides the new assistive device or refund, the consumer shall return the assistive device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer, along with any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.\n\n(2) Offers to return the assistive device to the manufacturer. No later than thirty days after the offer, the manufacturer shall provide a refund to the consumer.

No later than thirty days after the offer, the manufacturer shall provide a refund to the assistive device lessor. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the assistive device lessor shall provide to the manufacturer any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.\n\n3. Under the provisions of this section, the current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which that lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus the assistive device lessor’s early termination costs and the value of the assistive device at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the assistive device lessor’s early termination savings.\n\n4. Under the provisions of this section, a reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the total amount for which the written lease obligates the consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which is one thousand eight hundred twenty-five and the numerator of which is the number of days that the consumer used the assistive device before first reporting the nonconformity to the manufacturer, assistive device lessor, or assistive device dealer.\n\n5. A person shall not enforce a lease against a consumer after the consumer receives a refund.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1042, §3",
