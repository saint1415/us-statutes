The purposes of establishing an assisted living program include all of the following:\n\na.

To establish standards for assisted living programs that allow flexibility in design which promotes a social model of service delivery by focusing on independence, individual needs and desires, and consumer-driven quality of service.\n\nc. To encourage public participation in the development of assisted living programs for individuals of all income levels.\n\n3. It is the intent of the general assembly that the department promote a social model for assisted living programs and a consultative process to assist with compliance by assisted living programs.\n\n96 Acts, ch 1192, §1; 2003 Acts, ch 166, §7; 2005 Acts, ch 60, §1, 2, 21; 2007 Acts, ch 215, §160",
