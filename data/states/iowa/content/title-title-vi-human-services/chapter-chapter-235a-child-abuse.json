A release of information that would otherwise be confidential under section 217.30 concerning social services provided to the child or the child’s family shall not include information concerning financial or medical assistance provided to the child or the child’s family.\n\n2. The application shall state in reasonable detail the factors in support of the application. The juvenile court shall have jurisdiction to issue the order. A hearing shall be set immediately upon filing of an application under this section and subsequent proceedings shall be accorded priority by other courts.\n\n3. In considering the application, the court shall weigh the public’s interest and right to know the information against the privacy rights of the victim of the child abuse and other individuals who may be affected by the release of the information relating to the case of child abuse.\n\n4.
