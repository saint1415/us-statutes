All subsequent documents filed or court hearings held related to the action shall be in the district court in the county in which notice was filed pursuant to this subsection. The clerk shall file and docket the action.\n\n4. A party or child support services may request a court hearing regarding establishment of paternity or a determination of support, or both.\n\na. Upon receipt of a timely written response requesting a hearing or on its own initiative, child support services shall certify the matter for hearing in the district court in the county where the original notice of alleged paternity and support debt is filed, in accordance with section 252F.5.\n\nb. If paternity establishment was contested and paternity tests conducted, a court hearing on the issue of paternity shall be held no earlier than thirty days from the date paternity test results are issued to all parties by child support services, unless the parties mutually agree to waive the time frame pursuant to section 252F.8.\n\nc. Any objection to the results of paternity tests shall be filed no later than twenty days after the date paternity test results are issued or mailed to each party by child support services. Any objection to paternity test results filed by a party more than twenty days after the date paternity tests are issued or mailed to the party by child support services shall not be accepted or considered by the court.\n\n5. If a timely written response and request for a court hearing is not received by child support services and a party does not deny paternity, the department shall enter an order in accordance with section 252F.4.\n\n6. a. If a party contests the establishment of paternity, the party shall submit, within twenty days of service of the notice on the party under subsection 1, a written statement contesting paternity establishment to child support services. Upon receipt of a written challenge of paternity establishment, or upon initiation by child support services, the department shall enter ex parte administrative orders requiring the mother, child or children involved, and the putative father to submit to paternity testing, except that if the mother and child or children previously submitted blood or genetic specimens in a prior action to establish paternity against a different putative father, the previously submitted specimens and prior results, if available, may be utilized for testing in this action. Either the mother or putative father may contest paternity under this chapter.\n\nb. The orders shall be filed with the clerk of the district court in the county where the notice was filed and have the same force and effect as a court order for paternity testing.\n\nc. Child support services shall issue copies of the respective administrative orders for paternity testing to the mother and putative father in person, or by regular mail to the last known address of each, or if applicable, to the last known address of the attorney for each.\n\nd. If a paternity test is ordered under this section, the department shall direct that inherited characteristics be analyzed and interpreted, and shall appoint an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers to analyze and interpret the results. The test shall be of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation entities designated by the secretary of the United States department of health and human services and shall be performed by a laboratory approved by an accreditation entity.\n\ne. The party contesting paternity shall be provided one opportunity to reschedule the paternity testing appointment if the testing is rescheduled prior to the date of the originally scheduled appointment.\n\nf.

Child support services shall issue a copy of the filed test results to each party in person, or by regular mail to the last known address of each, or if applicable, to the last known address of the attorney for each. However, if the action is the result of a request from another state or foreign country, child support services shall issue a copy of the results to the initiating agency in that jurisdiction.\n\ng. Verified documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or genetic specimens is competent evidence to establish the chain of custody. The testimony of the appointed expert is not required. A verified expert’s report of test results which indicate a statistical probability of paternity is sufficient authenticity of the expert’s conclusion.\n\nh. A verified expert’s report shall be admitted as evidence to establish administrative paternity, and, if a court hearing is scheduled to resolve the issue of paternity, shall be admitted as evidence and is admissible at trial.\n\ni. If the verified expert concludes that the test results show that the putative father is not excluded and that the probability of the putative father’s paternity is ninety-five percent or higher, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the putative father is the biological father, and the evidence shall be sufficient as a basis for administrative establishment of paternity.\n\n(1) In order to challenge the presumption of paternity, a party shall file a written notice of the challenge with the district court within twenty days from the date the paternity test results are issued or mailed to all parties by child support services. Any challenge to a presumption of paternity resulting from paternity tests, or to paternity test results filed after the lapse of the twenty-day time frame shall not be accepted or admissible by child support services or the court.\n\n(2) A copy of the notice challenging the presumption of paternity shall be provided to any other party in person, or by mailing the notice to the last known address of each party, or if applicable, to the last known address of each party’s attorney.\n\n(3) The party challenging the presumption of paternity has the burden of proving that the putative father is not the father of the child.\n\n(4) The presumption of paternity may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nj. If the verified expert concludes that the test results indicate that the putative father is not excluded and that the probability of the putative father’s paternity is less than ninety-five percent, the department shall order a subsequent administrative paternity test or certify the case to the district court for resolution in accordance with the procedures and time frames specified in paragraph “i” and section 252F.5.\n\nk. If the results of the test or the verified expert’s analysis are timely challenged as provided in this subsection, the department, upon the request of a party and advance payment by the contestant or upon the initiative of child support services, shall order that an additional test be performed by the same laboratory or an independent laboratory. If the party requesting additional testing does not advance payment, the department shall certify the case to the district court in accordance with paragraph “i” and section 252F.5.\n\nl. When a subsequent paternity test is conducted, the time frames in this chapter associated with paternity tests shall apply to the most recently completed test.\n\nm. If the paternity test results exclude the putative father as a potential biological father of the child or children, and additional tests are not requested by either party or conducted on the initiative of child support services, or if additional tests exclude the putative father as a potential biological father, child support services shall withdraw its action against the putative father and shall file a notice of the withdrawal with the clerk of the district court, and shall provide a copy of the notice to each party in person, or by regular mail sent to each party’s last known address, or if applicable, the last known address of the party’s attorney.\n\nn. Except as provided in paragraph “k”, child support services shall advance the costs of genetic testing. If paternity is established and paternity testing was conducted, child support services shall enter an order or, if the action proceeded to a court hearing, request that the court enter a judgment for the costs of the paternity tests consistent with applicable federal law. In a proceeding under this chapter, a copy of a bill for genetic testing shall be admitted as evidence without requiring third-party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount incurred for genetic testing.\n\n93 Acts, ch 79, §16; 94 Acts, ch 1171, §32; 96 Acts, ch 1141, §5, 6; 97 Acts, ch 175, §77 – 84; 2005 Acts, ch 69, §17; 2007 Acts, ch 218, §169 – 175, 187; 2008 Acts, ch 1019, §18, 20; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2010 Acts, ch 1069, §29; 2012 Acts, ch 1061, §1; 2015 Acts, ch 110, §102, 103, 124; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §906\n\nReferred to in §234.39, 252F.4, 252F.5, 252F.6\n\nSection amended",
