A properly completed affidavit of paternity form developed by the department of health and human services and existing on or after July 1, 1993, but which is superseded by a later affidavit of paternity form developed by the department of health and human services, shall have the same legal effect as a paternity affidavit form used by the department of health and human services on or after July 1, 1997, regardless of the date of the filing and registration of the affidavit of paternity, unless otherwise required under federal law.\n\nb.

Unless the state registrar has received and registered an order as provided in section 252A.3, subsection 10, paragraph “a”, which legally establishes paternity, upon registration of a timely rescission form the state registrar shall remove the father’s information from the certificate of birth, and shall send a written notice of the rescission to the last known address of the signatory of the affidavit of paternity who did not sign the rescission form.\n\nc. The department of health and human services shall develop a rescission form and an administrative process for rescission. The form shall be the only rescission form recognized for the purpose of rescinding a completed affidavit of paternity.

The petitioner may include in or attach to the petition any information which may help in locating or identifying the respondent including, but without limitation by enumeration, a photograph of the respondent, a description of any distinguishing marks of the respondent’s person, other names and aliases by which the respondent has been or is known, the name of the respondent’s employer, the respondent’s fingerprints, or social security number.\n\n2. It shall not be necessary for the dependent or the dependent’s witnesses to appear personally at a hearing on the petition, but it shall be the duty of the petitioner’s representative to appear on behalf of and represent the petitioner at all stages of the proceeding.\n\n3. If at a hearing on the petition the respondent controverts the petition and enters a verified denial of any of the material allegations, the judge presiding at the hearing shall stay the proceedings. The petitioner shall be given the opportunity to present further evidence to address issues which the respondent has controverted.\n\n4. If the respondent appears at the hearing and fails to answer the petition or admits the allegations of the petition, or if, after a hearing, the court has found and determined that the prayer of the petitioner, or any part of the prayer, is supported by the evidence adduced in the proceeding, and that the dependent is in need of and entitled to support from a party, the court shall make and enter an order directing a party to furnish support for the dependent and to pay a sum as the court determines pursuant to section 598.21A or 598.21B, as applicable. Upon entry of an order for support or upon failure of a person to make payments pursuant to an order for support, the court may require a party to provide security, a bond, or other guarantee which the court determines is satisfactory to secure the payment of the support. Upon the party’s failure to pay the support under the order, the court may declare the security, bond, or other guarantee forfeited.\n\n5. The court making such order may require the party to make payment at specified intervals to the clerk of the district court or to the collection services center, and to report personally to the sheriff or any other official, at such times as may be deemed necessary.\n\n6. A party who willfully fails to comply with or who violates the terms or conditions of the support order or of the party’s probation shall be punished by the court in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided by law for a contempt of such court or a violation of probation ordered by such court in any other suit or proceeding cognizable by such court.\n\n7. Except as provided in 28 U.S.C. §1738B, any order of support issued by a court shall not supersede any previous order of support issued in a divorce or separate maintenance action, but the amounts for a particular period paid pursuant to either order shall be credited against amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under both.

Except with the consent of all parties, the trial shall not be held until after the birth of the child and shall be held no earlier than twenty days from the date the respondent is served with notice of the action or, if blood or genetic tests are conducted, no earlier than thirty days from the date the test results are filed with the clerk of the district court as provided under section 600B.41.\n\nb. If the respondent, after being served with notice as required under section 252A.6, fails to timely respond to the notice, or to appear for blood or genetic tests pursuant to a court or administrative order, or to appear at a scheduled hearing after being provided notice of the hearing, the court shall find the respondent in default, and shall enter an order establishing paternity and establishing the monthly child support payment and the amount of the support debt accrued and accruing pursuant to section 598.21B, or medical support pursuant to chapter 252E, or both.\n\nc. Appropriate genetic testing procedures shall be used which include any genetic test generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the secretary of the United States department of health and human services and which are performed by a laboratory approved by such an accreditation body.\n\nd. A copy of a bill for blood or genetic testing, or for the cost of prenatal care or the birth of the child, shall be admitted as evidence without requiring third-party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of amounts incurred for testing.\n\n2. When an action is initiated to establish child or medical support based on a prior determination of paternity and the respondent files an answer to the notice denying paternity, all of the following shall apply:\n\na. (1) If paternity has been legally established by one of the methods enumerated in section 252A.3, subsection 10, or by operation of law due to the established father’s marriage to the mother at the time of conception, birth, or at any time during the period between conception and birth of the child, the provisions of section 600B.41A are applicable.\n\n(2) If the court determines that the prior determination of paternity should not be overcome, pursuant to section 600B.41A, and that the party has a duty to provide support, the court shall enter an order establishing the monthly child support payment and the amount of the support debt accrued and accruing pursuant to section 598.21B, or medical support pursuant to chapter 252E, or both.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), if the prior determination of paternity is based on an administrative or court order or by any other means, pursuant to the laws of another state or foreign country, an action to overcome the prior determination of paternity shall be filed in that jurisdiction. Unless the party requests and is granted a stay of an action to establish child or medical support, the action shall proceed as otherwise provided.\n\n3. If the expert analyzing the blood or genetic test concludes that the test results demonstrate that the putative father is not excluded and that the probability of the putative father’s paternity is ninety-nine percent or higher and if the test results have not been challenged, the court, upon motion by a party, shall enter a temporary order for child support to be paid pursuant to section 598.21B. The court shall require temporary support to be paid to the clerk of court or to the collection services center. If the court subsequently determines the putative father is not the father, the court shall terminate the temporary support order. All support obligations which came due prior to the order terminating temporary support are unaffected by this action and remain a judgment subject to enforcement.\n\n94 Acts, ch 1171, §14; 95 Acts, ch 67, §18; 97 Acts, ch 175, §3 – 5, 14 – 17; 2005 Acts, ch 69, §5 – 7; 2015 Acts, ch 110, §80; 2023 Acts, ch 123, §4, 5\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph a, subparagraph (1) amended\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph b amended",
