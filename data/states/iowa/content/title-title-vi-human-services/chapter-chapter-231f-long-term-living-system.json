The general assembly finds and declares that the intent for Iowa’s long-term living system is to ensure all Iowans access to an extensive range of high-quality, affordable, and cost-effective long-term living options that maximize independence, choice, and dignity for consumers.\n\n2. The long-term living system should be comprehensive, offering multiple services and support in home, community-based, and facility-based settings; should utilize a uniform assessment process to ensure that such services and support are delivered in the most integrated and life-enhancing setting; and should ensure that such services and support are provided by a well-trained, motivated workforce.\n\n3. The long-term living system should exist in a regulatory climate that appropriately ensures the health, safety, and welfare of consumers, while not being overly restrictive or inflexible.\n\n4. The long-term living system should sustain existing informal care systems including family, friends, volunteers, and community resources; should encourage innovation through the use of technology and new delivery and financing models, including housing; should provide incentives to consumers for private financing of long-term living services and support; and should allow Iowans to live independently as long as they desire.\n\n5. Information regarding all components of the long-term living system should be effectively communicated to all persons potentially impacted by the need for long-term living services and support in order to empower consumers to plan, evaluate, and make decisions about how best to meet their own long-term living needs.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 175, §146",
