The financial institution may require positive voice recognition and may require the telephone number of the authorized person from child support services before releasing an obligor’s account information by telephone.\n\n2. Child support services and financial institutions doing business in Iowa shall enter into agreements to develop and operate a data match system, using automated data exchanges to the maximum extent feasible. The data match system shall allow a means by which each financial institution shall provide to child support services for each calendar quarter the name, record address, social security number or other taxpayer identification number, and other identifying information for each obligor who maintains an account at the institution and who owes past-due support, as identified by child support services by name and social security number or other taxpayer identification number. Child support services shall work with representatives of financial institutions to develop a system to assist nonautomated financial institutions in complying with the provisions of this section.\n\n3. Child support services may pay a reasonable fee to a financial institution for conducting the data match required in subsection 2, not to exceed the lower of either one hundred fifty dollars for each quarterly data match or the actual costs incurred by the financial institution for each quarterly data match. However, child support services may also adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to specify a fee amount for each quarterly data match based upon the estimated state share of funds collected under this chapter, which, when adopted, shall be applied in lieu of the one hundred fifty dollar fee under this subsection. In addition, child support services may pay a reasonable fee to a financial institution for automation programming development performed in order to conduct the data match required in subsection 2, not to exceed the lower of either five hundred dollars or the actual costs incurred by the financial institution. Child support services may use the state share of funds collected under this chapter to pay the fees to financial institutions under this subsection. For state fiscal years beginning July 1, 1999, and July 1, 2000, child support services may use up to one hundred percent of the state share of such funds. For state fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, child support services may use up to fifty percent of the state share of such funds.

If child support services does not have sufficient funds available under this subsection for payment of fees under this subsection for conducting data matches or for automation program development performed in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1999, the cost may be carried forward to the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000. Child support services may also use funds from an amount assessed a child support agency of another state, as defined in section 252H.2, to conduct a data match requested by that child support agency as provided in 42 U.S.C. §666(a)(14) to pay fees to financial institutions under this subsection.\n\n4. a.

Actions initiated by child support services under this chapter are not subject to chapter 17A, and resulting court hearings following certification shall be an original hearing before the district court.\n\n2. The person challenging the action shall submit a written challenge to child support services within ten working days of the date of the notice.\n\n3. Child support services shall, upon receipt of a written challenge, review the facts of the case with the challenging party. Only a mistake of fact including but not limited to a mistake in the identity of the obligor or a mistake in the amount of delinquent support due shall be considered as a reason to dismiss or modify the proceeding.\n\n4. If child support services determines that a mistake of fact has occurred, child support services shall proceed as follows:\n\na. If a mistake in identity has occurred or the obligor is not delinquent in an amount equal to the payment for one month, child support services shall notify the financial institution that the administrative levy has been released. Child support services shall provide a copy of the notice to the support obligor by regular mail.\n\nb. If the obligor is delinquent, but the amount of the delinquency is less than the amount indicated in the notice, child support services shall notify the financial institution of the revised amount with a copy of the notice and issue a copy to the obligor or forward a copy to the obligor by regular mail. Upon written receipt of instructions from child support services, the financial institution shall release the funds in excess of the revised amount to the obligor and the moneys in the amount of the debt shall be processed according to section 252I.7.\n\n5. If child support services finds no mistake of fact, child support services shall provide a notice to that effect to the challenging party by regular mail. Upon written request of the challenging party, child support services shall request a hearing before the district court in the county in which the underlying support order is filed.\n\na. The financial institution shall encumber moneys if child support services notifies the financial institution to do so.\n\nb. The clerk of the district court shall schedule a hearing upon the request by child support services for a time not later than ten calendar days after the filing of the request for hearing. The clerk shall mail copies of the request for hearing and the order scheduling the hearing to child support services and to all account holders of interest.\n\nc. If the court finds that there is a mistake of identity or that the obligor does not owe the delinquent support, child support services shall notify the financial institution that the administrative levy has been released.\n\nd. If the court finds that the obligor has an interest in the account, and the amount of support due was incorrectly overstated, child support services shall notify the financial institution to release the excess moneys to the obligor and remit the remaining moneys in the amount of the debt to the collection services center for disbursement to the appropriate recipient.\n\ne. If the court finds that the obligor has an interest in the account, and the amount of support due is correct, the financial institution shall forward the moneys to the collection services center for disbursement to the appropriate recipient.\n\nf. If the obligor or any other party known to have an interest in the account fails to appear at the hearing, the court may find the challenging party in default, shall ratify the administrative levy, if valid upon its face, and shall enter an order directing the financial institution to release the moneys to child support services.\n\ng. Issues related to visitation, custody, or other provisions not related to levies against accounts are not grounds for a hearing under this chapter.\n\nh. Support orders shall not be modified under a challenge pursuant to this section.\n\ni. Any findings in the challenge of an administrative levy related to the amount of the accruing or accrued support obligation do not modify the underlying support order.\n\nj. An order entered under this chapter for a levy against an account of a support obligor has priority over a levy for a purpose other than the support of the dependents in the court order being enforced.\n\n6. The support obligor may withdraw the request for challenge by submitting a written withdrawal to the person identified as the contact for child support services in the notice or child support services may withdraw the administrative levy at any time prior to the court hearing and provide notice of the withdrawal to the obligor and any account holder of interest and to the financial institution, by regular mail.\n\n7. If the financial institution has forwarded moneys to the collection services center and has deducted a fee from the moneys of the account, or if any additional fees or costs are levied against the account, and all funds are subsequently refunded to the account due to a mistake of fact or ruling of the court, child support services shall reimburse the account for any fees assessed by the financial institution. If the mistake of fact is a mistake in the amount of support due and any portion of the moneys is retained as support payments, however, child support services is not required to reimburse the account for any fees or costs levied against the account. Additionally, for the purposes of reimbursement to the account for any fees or costs, each certificate of deposit is considered a separate account.\n\n94 Acts, ch 1101, §8; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §958\n\nSection amended",
