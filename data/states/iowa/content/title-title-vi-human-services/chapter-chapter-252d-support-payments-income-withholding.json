In a support order issued or modified on or after November 1, 1990, for which services are being provided by child support services, and in any support orders issued or modified after January 1, 1994, for which services are not provided by child support services, the income of a support obligor is subject to withholding, on the effective date of the order, regardless of whether support payments by the obligor are in arrears. If services are being provided pursuant to chapter 252B, child support services may enter an ex parte order for an immediate withholding of income. The district court may enter an ex parte order for immediate income withholding for cases in which child support services is not providing services. The income of the obligor is subject to immediate withholding unless one of the following occurs:\n\na. One of the parties demonstrates and the court or child support services finds there is good cause not to require immediate withholding. A finding of good cause shall be based on, at a minimum, written findings and conclusions by the court or administrative authority as to why implementing immediate withholding would not be in the best interests of the child. In cases involving modifications, the findings shall also include proof of timely payment of previously ordered support.\n\nb. A written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement. If the support payments have been assigned to the department pursuant to chapter 234 or 239B, or a comparable statute of another jurisdiction, the department shall be considered a party to the support order, and a written agreement pursuant to this section to waive immediate withholding is void unless approved by child support services. Any agreement existing at the time an assignment of support is made pursuant to chapter 234 or 239B or pursuant to a comparable statute of another jurisdiction shall not prevent child support services from implementing immediate withholding.\n\n2. For an order not requiring immediate withholding, income of an obligor is subject to immediate withholding, without regard to whether there is an arrearage, on the earliest of the following:\n\na. The date the obligor requests that the withholding begin.\n\nb. The date the custodial parent or party to the proceeding requests that the withholding begin, if the request is approved by the district court or, in cases in which services are being provided pursuant to chapter 252B, if child support services approves the request.\n\n90 Acts, ch 1123, §1; 93 Acts, ch 78, §11; 94 Acts, ch 1171, §24; 97 Acts, ch 41, §32; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §881\n\nReferred to in §252D.31\n\nSection amended",
