Person to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify, or refer for employment, to discharge any employee, or to otherwise discriminate in employment against any applicant for employment or any employee because of the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such applicant or employee, unless based upon the nature of the occupation. If a person with a disability is qualified to perform a particular occupation, by reason of training or experience, the nature of that occupation shall not be the basis for exception to the unfair or discriminatory practices prohibited by this subsection.\n\nb. Labor organization or the employees, agents, or members thereof to refuse to admit to membership any applicant, to expel any member, or to otherwise discriminate against any applicant for membership or any member in the privileges, rights, or benefits of such membership because of the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such applicant or member.\n\nc. Employer, employment agency, labor organization, or the employees, agents, or members thereof to directly or indirectly advertise or in any other manner indicate or publicize that individuals of any particular age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability are unwelcome, objectionable, not acceptable, or not solicited for employment or membership unless based on the nature of the occupation.\n\n(1) If a person with a disability is qualified to perform a particular occupation by reason of training or experience, the nature of that occupation shall not be the basis for exception to the unfair or discriminatory practices prohibited by this subsection.\n\n(2) An employer, employment agency, or their employees, servants, or agents may offer employment or advertise for employment to only persons with disabilities, when other applicants have available to them other employment compatible with their ability which would not be available to persons with disabilities because of their disabilities. Any such employment or offer of employment shall not discriminate among persons with disabilities on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.\n\nd. Person to solicit or require as a condition of employment of any employee or prospective employee a test for the presence of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus or to affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or terminate the employment of any employee solely as a result of the employee obtaining a test for the presence of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus. An agreement between an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or their employees, agents, or members and an employee or prospective employee concerning employment, pay, or benefits to an employee or prospective employee in return for taking a test for the presence of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus, is prohibited. The prohibitions of this paragraph do not apply if the state epidemiologist determines and the director of health and human services declares through the utilization of guidelines established by the center for disease control of the United States department of health and human services, that a person with a condition related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome poses a significant risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus to other persons in a specific occupation.\n\n2. Employment policies relating to pregnancy and childbirth shall be governed by the following:\n\na. A written or unwritten employment policy or practice which excludes from employment applicants or employees because of the employee’s pregnancy is a prima facie violation of this chapter.\n\nb. Disabilities caused or contributed to by the employee’s pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment. Written and unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority, and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement, and payment under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal or informal, shall be applied to a disability due to the employee’s pregnancy or giving birth, on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities.\n\nc. Disabilities caused or contributed to by legal abortion and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under any temporary disability or sick leave plan available in connection with employment. Written and unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority, and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement, and payment under any temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal or informal, shall be applied to a disability due to legal abortion on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities. The employer may elect to exclude health insurance coverage for abortion from a plan provided by the employer, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or where medical complications have arisen from an abortion.\n\nd. An employer shall not terminate the employment of a person disabled by pregnancy because of the employee’s pregnancy.\n\ne. Where a leave is not available or a sufficient leave is not available under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment, the employer of the pregnant employee shall not refuse to grant to the employee who is disabled by the pregnancy a leave of absence if the leave of absence is for the period that the employee is disabled because of the employee’s pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, or for eight weeks, whichever is less. However, the employee must provide timely notice of the period of leave requested and the employer must approve any change in the period requested before the change is effective. Before granting the leave of absence, the employer may require that the employee’s disability resulting from pregnancy be verified by medical certification stating that the employee is not able to reasonably perform the duties of employment.\n\n3. This section shall not prohibit discrimination on the basis of age if the person subject to the discrimination is under the age of eighteen years, unless that person is considered by law to be an adult.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a state or federal program designed to benefit a specific age classification which serves a bona fide public purpose shall be permissible.\n\n5. This section shall not apply to age discrimination in bona fide apprenticeship employment programs if the employee is over forty-five years of age.\n\n6. This section shall not apply to:\n\na. Any employer who regularly employs less than four individuals. For purposes of this subsection, individuals who are members of the employer’s family shall not be counted as employees.\n\nb.

Any bona fide religious institution or its educational facility, association, corporation, or society with respect to any qualifications for employment based on religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity when such qualifications are related to a bona fide religious purpose. A religious qualification for instructional personnel or an administrative officer, serving in a supervisory capacity of a bona fide religious educational facility or religious institution, shall be presumed to be a bona fide occupational qualification.\n\n[C66, 71, §105A.7; C73, §601A.7; C75, 77, 79, 81, §601A.6]\n\n87 Acts, ch 201, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1236, §2\n\nC93, §216.6\n\n96 Acts, ch 1129, §27, 113; 2007 Acts, ch 191, §3, 4; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §220; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §67, 68; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §284\n\nReferred to in §216.2, 400.8\n\nSee also §139A.13A, 915.23\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph d amended",

The general assembly finds that the practice of discriminating against any employee because of the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such employee by paying wages to such employee at a rate less than the rate paid to other employees does all of the following:\n\n(1) Unjustly discriminates against the person receiving the lesser rate.\n\n(2) Leads to low employee morale, high turnover, and frequent labor unrest.\n\n(3) Discourages employees paid at lesser wage rates from training for higher level jobs.\n\n(4) Curtails employment opportunities, decreases employees’ mobility, and increases labor costs.\n\n(5) Impairs purchasing power and threatens the maintenance of an adequate standard of living by such employees and their families.\n\n(6) Prevents optimum utilization of the state’s available labor resources.\n\n(7) Threatens the well-being of citizens of this state and adversely affects the general welfare.\n\nb.

An employer or agent of an employer who is paying wages to an employee at a rate less than the rate paid to other employees in violation of this section shall not remedy the violation by reducing the wage rate of any employee.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, an unfair or discriminatory practice occurs when a discriminatory pay decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory pay decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory pay decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.\n\n3. It shall be an affirmative defense to a claim arising under this section if any of the following applies:\n\na. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a seniority system.\n\nb. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a merit system.\n\nc. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production.\n\nd. Pay differential is based on any other factor other than the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such employee.\n\n4.

Unless the commission finding of a discriminatory or unfair practice is reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of discrimination is binding on the licensing agency. If a certification is made pursuant to this subsection, the licensing agency may initiate licensee disciplinary procedures.\n\n(2) In the case of a respondent who is found by the commission to have engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice in the course of performing under a contract or subcontract with the state or political subdivision or agency, if the practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed, or knowingly or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors of the respondent or by an officer or executive agent acting within the scope of the officer’s or agent’s employment, the commission shall so certify to the contracting agency. Unless the commission’s finding of a discriminatory or unfair practice is reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of discrimination is binding on the contracting agency.\n\n(3) Upon receiving a certification made under this subsection, a contracting agency may take appropriate action to terminate a contract or portion thereof previously entered into with the respondent, either absolutely or on condition that the respondent carry out a program of compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and assist the state and all political subdivisions and agencies thereof to refrain from entering into further contracts.\n\nc. The election of an affirmative order under paragraph “b” of this subsection shall not bar the election of affirmative remedies provided in paragraph “a” of this subsection.\n\n10. a. The terms of a conciliation or mediation agreement reached with the respondent may require the respondent to refrain in the future from committing discriminatory or unfair practices of the type stated in the agreement, to take remedial action as in the judgment of the commission will carry out the purposes of this chapter, and to consent to the entry in an appropriate district court of a consent decree embodying the terms of the conciliation or mediation agreement. Violation of such a consent decree may be punished as contempt by the court in which it is filed, upon a showing by the commission of the violation at any time within six months of its occurrence. At any time in its discretion, the commission may investigate whether the terms of the agreement are being complied with by the respondent.\n\nb. Upon a finding that the terms of the conciliation or mediation agreement are not being complied with by the respondent, the commission shall take appropriate action to assure compliance.\n\n11. If, upon taking into consideration all of the evidence at a hearing, the commission finds that a respondent has not engaged in any such discriminatory or unfair practice, the commission shall issue an order denying relief and stating the findings of fact and conclusions of the commission, and shall cause a copy of the order dismissing the complaint to be served on the complainant and the respondent.\n\n12. The commission shall establish rules to govern, expedite, and effectuate the procedures established by this chapter and its own actions thereunder.\n\n13. Except as provided in section 614.8, a claim under this chapter shall not be maintained unless a complaint is filed with the commission within three hundred days after the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice occurred.\n\n14.
