The person protected by the order may provide this affidavit.\n\nb. The clerk shall provide copies of the order as required by section 236A.7, except that notice shall not be provided to the respondent without the express written direction of the person in whose favor the order was entered.\n\n3. a. A valid foreign protective order has the same effect and shall be enforced in the same manner as a protective order issued in this state whether or not filed with a clerk of court or otherwise placed in a registry of protective orders.\n\nb. A foreign protective order is valid if it meets all of the following:\n\n(1) The order states the name of the protected person and the person against whom enforcement is sought.\n\n(2) The order has not expired.\n\n(3) The order was issued by a court or tribunal that had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter under the law of the foreign jurisdiction.\n\n(4) The order was issued in accordance with the respondent’s due process rights, either after the respondent was provided with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before the court or tribunal that issued the order, or in the case of an ex parte order, the respondent was granted notice and opportunity to be heard within a reasonable time after the order was issued.\n\nc. Proof that a foreign protective order failed to meet all of the factors listed in paragraph “b” shall be an affirmative defense in any action seeking enforcement of the order.\n\n4. A peace officer shall treat a foreign protective order as a valid legal document and shall make an arrest for a violation of the foreign protective order in the same manner that a peace officer would make an arrest for a violation of a protective order issued within this state.\n\na. The fact that a foreign protective order has not been filed with the clerk of court or otherwise placed in a registry shall not be grounds to refuse to enforce the terms of the order unless it is apparent to the officer that the order is invalid on its face.\n\nb. A peace officer acting reasonably and in good faith in connection with the enforcement of a foreign protective order shall be immune from civil and criminal liability in any action arising in connection with such enforcement.\n\n5. Filing and service costs in connection with foreign protective orders are waived as provided in section 236A.3.\n\n2017 Acts, ch 121, §22\n\nReferred to in §664A.1",
