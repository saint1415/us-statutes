If none of the plans with dependent coverage is accessible to the dependent, child support services shall amend or terminate the notice.\n\n(b) If more than one of the plans is accessible to the dependent, the plan selected shall be the plan that provides basic coverage for which the employee’s share of the premium is lowest.\n\n(c) If more than one of the plans is accessible to the dependent but none of the accessible plans provides basic coverage, the plan selected shall be a plan that is accessible and for which the employee’s share of the premium is lowest.\n\n(d) If the employee’s share of the premiums is the same under all plans described in subparagraph (b) or (c), child support services shall attempt to consult with the obligee when selecting the plan. If the obligee does not respond within ten days of child support services’ attempt, child support services shall select a plan which shall be the plan’s default option, if any, or the plan with the lowest deductibles and copayment requirements.\n\n(4) If the obligor is not enrolled in a health benefit plan or is not enrolled in a health benefit plan that offers dependent coverage, if more than one plan with dependent coverage is offered by the employer, and if the notice is issued by the child support enforcement agency of another state, that agency shall select the plan as provided in paragraph “h”, subparagraph (3).\n\nh.

Provide child support services with the type of health benefit plan under which the dependent has been enrolled, including whether dental, optical, office visits, and prescription drugs are covered services.\n\n(3) If more than one health benefit plan is available to the obligor and the obligor is not enrolled, forward plan descriptions and documents to the department and enroll the dependent, and if necessary the obligor, in the plan selected by the department or in any default option if the plan administrator has not received a selection from the department within twenty business days of the date the plan administrator returned the national medical support notice response to the department.\n\n(4) If the obligor is subject to a waiting period that expires more than ninety days from the date of receipt of the notice by the plan administrator or if the obligor has not completed a waiting period that is measured in a manner other than the passage of time, notify the employer, the department, the obligor, and the obligee. Upon satisfaction of the period or requirement, complete the enrollment.\n\n(5) Upon completion of the enrollment, notify the employer for a determination of whether the necessary employee share of the premium is available.\n\n(6) If the plan administrator is subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as codified in 29 U.S.C. §1169, or is subject to the federal Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-200, §401, subsection (e) or (f), and the plan administrator determines the notice does not constitute a qualified medical child support order, complete and send the response to the department and notify the obligor, the obligee, and the child of the specific reason for the determination.\n\n9.
