No. 105-89, as codified in 42 U.S.C. §622(b)(10), 671(a)(16), and 675(1),(5), which is designed to achieve placement in the most appropriate, least restrictive, and most family-like setting available and in close proximity to the parent’s home, consistent with the best interests and special needs of the child, and which considers the placement’s proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement. The plan shall be developed by the department or agency involved and the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian. If the child is fourteen years of age or older, the plan shall be developed in consultation with the child and, at the option of the child, with up to two persons chosen by the child to be members of the child’s case planning team if such persons are not a foster parent of, or caseworker for, the child. The department may reject a person selected by a child to be a member of the child’s case planning team at any time if the department has good cause to believe that the person would not act in the best interests of the child. One person selected by a child to be a member of the child’s case planning team may be designated to be the child’s advisor or, if necessary, the child’s advocate with respect to the application of the reasonable and prudent parent standard. The plan shall specifically include all of the following:\n\na. Plans for carrying out the voluntary placement agreement or judicial determination pursuant to which the child entered care.\n\nb. The type and appropriateness of the placement and services to be provided to the child.\n\nc. The care and services that will be provided to the child, biological parents, and foster parents.\n\nd.

The transition plan and needs assessment shall be developed with a focus on the services, other support, and actions necessary to facilitate the child’s successful entry into adulthood. The transition plan shall be personalized at the direction of the child and shall be developed with the child present, honoring the goals and concerns of the child, and shall address the following areas of need for the child’s successful transition from foster care to adulthood, including but not limited to all of the following:\n\n(a) Education.\n\n(b) Employment services and other workforce support.\n\n(c) Health and health care coverage.\n\n(d) Housing and money management.\n\n(e) Relationships, including local opportunities to have a mentor.\n\n(f) If the needs assessment indicates the child is reasonably likely to need or be eligible for services or other support from the adult service system upon reaching age eighteen, the transition plan shall provide for the child’s application for adult services.\n\n(2) The transition plan shall be considered a working document and shall be reviewed and updated during a periodic case review, which shall occur at a minimum of once every six months.

The transition plan may be reviewed and updated more frequently.\n\n(3) The transition plan shall be developed and reviewed by the department in collaboration with a child-centered transition team. The transition team shall be comprised of the child’s caseworker and persons selected by the child, persons who have knowledge of services available to the child, and any person who may reasonably be expected to be a service provider for the child when the child becomes an adult or to become responsible for the costs of services at that time. If the child is reasonably likely to need or be eligible for adult services, the transition team membership shall include representatives from the adult services system. The membership of the transition team and the meeting dates for the team shall be documented in the transition plan.\n\n(4) The final transition plan shall specifically identify how the need for housing will be addressed.\n\n(5) If the child is interested in pursuing higher education, the transition plan shall provide for the child’s participation in the college student aid commission’s program of assistance in applying for federal and state aid under section 256.177.\n\n(6) If the needs assessment indicates the child is reasonably likely to need or be eligible for services or other support from the adult service system upon reaching age eighteen, the transition plan shall be reviewed and approved by the transition committee for the area in which the child resides, in accordance with section 235.7, before the child reaches age seventeen and one-half. The transition committee’s review and approval shall be indicated in the case permanency plan.\n\n(7) The transition plan shall include a provision for the department or a designee of the department on or before the date the child reaches age eighteen, unless the child has been placed in foster care for less than thirty days, to provide to the child written verification of the child’s foster care status, and a certified copy of the child’s birth certificate, social security card, and driver’s license or government-issued nonoperator’s identification card.

The information shall be provided whether the child’s placement is voluntary or made pursuant to a court determination. The information shall be provided at the time it is learned by the department or agency developing the plan and, if possible, at the time of the child’s placement. The information shall only be withheld if ordered by the court or it is determined by the department or agency developing the plan that providing the information would be detrimental to the child or to the family with whom the child is living. In determining whether providing the information would be detrimental, the court, department, or agency shall consider any history of abuse within the child’s family or toward the child.\n\nm.

The juvenile court may enter an order overcoming paternity of an established father pursuant to section 600B.41A if all of the following conditions are met:\n\na. The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance in an active juvenile court case and a dispositional order in that case is in place.\n\nb. Paternity of the child has been legally established, including by one of the methods enumerated in section 252A.3, subsection 10, or by operation of law due to the established father’s marriage to the mother at the time of conception, birth, or at any time during the period between conception and the birth of the child.\n\nc.

The juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings concerning a child who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act unless otherwise provided by law, and has exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings concerning an adult who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act prior to having become an adult, and who has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to an order under section 803.5.\n\nb.

A child convicted of a violation excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under this paragraph shall be sentenced pursuant to section 805.8, where applicable, and pursuant to section 903.1, subsection 3, for all other violations.\n\nc. Violations by a child, aged sixteen or older, which subject the child to the provisions of section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph “e” or “f”, or violations of section 723A.2 which involve a violation of chapter 724, or violation of chapter 724 which constitutes a felony, or violations which constitute a forcible felony are excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and shall be prosecuted as otherwise provided by law unless the district court transfers jurisdiction of the child to the juvenile court upon motion and for good cause pursuant to section 803.6. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code to the contrary, the district court may accept from a child in district court a plea of guilty, or may instruct the jury on a lesser included offense to the offense excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under this paragraph, in the same manner as regarding an adult. The judgment and sentence of a child in district court shall be as provided in section 901.5. However, the juvenile court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in a proceeding concerning an offense of animal torture as provided in section 717B.3A alleged to have been committed by a child under the age of seventeen.\n\nd. The juvenile court shall have jurisdiction in proceedings commenced against a child pursuant to section 236.3 over which the district court has waived its jurisdiction. The juvenile court shall hear the action in the manner of an adjudicatory hearing under section 232.47, subject to the following:\n\n(1) The juvenile court shall abide by the provisions of sections 236.4, 236.6, 236A.6, and 236A.8 in holding hearings and making a disposition.\n\n(2) The plaintiff is entitled to proceed pro se under sections 236.3A and 236.3B.\n\ne. The juvenile court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in a proceeding concerning a child under the age of eighteen alleged to have committed the offense of harassment in violation of section 708.7, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (5).\n\n2. a. A case involving a person charged in a court other than the juvenile court with the commission of a public offense not exempted by law from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and who is within the provisions of subsection 1 of this section shall immediately be transferred to the juvenile court. The transferring court shall order a transfer and shall forward the transfer order together with all papers, documents, and a transcript of all testimony filed or admitted into evidence in connection with the case to the clerk of the juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall attach immediately upon the signing of an order of transfer. From the time of transfer, the custody, shelter care, and detention of the person alleged to have committed a delinquent act shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the case shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\nb. Upon completion of the transfer to juvenile court, the court shall file an order dismissing the charge in the transferring court and directing the clerk of court to seal all records of the charge initiated in the transferring court.\n\n3. a. The juvenile court, after a hearing and in accordance with the provisions of section 232.45, may waive jurisdiction of a child alleged to have committed a public offense so that the child may be prosecuted as an adult or youthful offender for such offense in another court. If the child pleads guilty or is found guilty of a public offense other than a class “A” felony in another court of this state, that court may suspend the sentence or, with the consent of the child, defer judgment or sentence and, without regard to restrictions placed upon deferred judgments or sentences for adults, place the child on probation for a period of not less than one year upon such conditions as it may require. Upon fulfillment of the conditions of probation, a child who receives a deferred judgment shall be discharged without entry of judgment. A child prosecuted as a youthful offender shall be sentenced pursuant to section 907.3A.\n\nb. This subsection does not apply in a proceeding concerning an offense of animal torture as provided in section 717B.3A alleged to have been committed by a child under the age of seventeen.\n\n4. In a proceeding concerning a child who is alleged to have committed a second delinquent act or a second violation excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the court or the juvenile court shall determine whether there is reason to believe that the child regularly abuses alcohol or other controlled substance and may be in need of treatment. If the court so determines, the court shall advise appropriate juvenile authorities and refer such offenders to the juvenile court for disposition pursuant to section 232.52A.\n\n5. a. Juvenile court services may provide follow-up services for a child adjudicated to have committed a delinquent act upon the child reaching eighteen years of age until the child is twenty-one years of age, if the child and juvenile court services determine the child should remain under the guidance of a juvenile court officer. Follow-up services shall be made available to the child, as necessary, to meet the long-term needs of the child aging into adulthood.\n\nb. A child who remains under the guidance of juvenile court services under paragraph “a” who is alleged to have committed a subsequent public offense shall be prosecuted as an adult.\n\n6. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as affecting the statutory limitations on prosecutions for murder in the first or second degree.\n\n7. The supreme court shall prescribe rules under section 602.4202 to resolve jurisdictional and venue issues when juveniles who are placed in another court’s jurisdiction are alleged to have committed subsequent delinquent acts.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, §232.63 – 232.67, 232.72; C79, 81, §232.8]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1275, §6; 86 Acts, ch 1186, §1, 2; 87 Acts, ch 149, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1134, §48; 88 Acts, ch 1167, §1; 90 Acts, ch 1251, §23, 24; 91 Acts, ch 240, §9; 92 Acts, ch 1160, §21; 92 Acts, ch 1231, §12; 95 Acts, ch 180, §2; 95 Acts, ch 191, §8; 96 Acts, ch 1134, §1; 97 Acts, ch 126, §11; 2000 Acts, ch 1056, §1; 2000 Acts, ch 1152, §1, 2; 2000 Acts, ch 1232, §57, 58; 2004 Acts, ch 1132, §79; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2013 Acts, ch 42, §1, 2; 2015 Acts, ch 62, §1; 2017 Acts, ch 117, §1; 2017 Acts, ch 121, §2; 2018 Acts, ch 1153, §3; 2019 Acts, ch 24, §23\n\nReferred to in §232.22, 232.45, 232.45A, 232.52A, 232.53, 232C.4, 717B.3A, 803.5, 803.6",

At the hearing to determine whether detention or shelter care is authorized under section 232.21 or 232.22 the court shall admit only testimony and other evidence relevant to the determination of whether there is probable cause to believe the child has committed the act as alleged in the petition and to the determination of whether the placement of the child in detention or shelter care is authorized under section 232.21 or 232.22. At the hearing to determine whether a child who has been waived for prosecution as a youthful offender should be released from detention the court shall also admit evidence of the kind admissible to determine bond or bail under chapter 811, notwithstanding section 811.1. Any written reports or records made available to the court at the hearing shall be made available to the parties. A copy of the petition or waiver order shall be given to each of the parties at or before the hearing.\n\n5. The court shall find release to be proper under the following circumstances:\n\na. If the court finds that there is not probable cause to believe that the child is a child within the jurisdiction of the court under this chapter, it shall release the child and dismiss the petition.\n\nb. If the court finds that detention or shelter care is not authorized under section 232.21 or 232.22, or is authorized but not warranted in a particular case, the court shall order the child’s release, and in so doing, may impose one or more of the following conditions:\n\n(1) Place the child in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian under that person’s supervision, or under the supervision of an organization which agrees to supervise the child.\n\n(2) Place restrictions on the child’s travel, association, or place of residence during the period of release.\n\n(3) Impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary and consistent with the grounds for detaining children specified in section 232.21 or 232.22, including a condition requiring that the child return to custody as required.\n\n(4) In the case of a child waived for prosecution as a youthful offender, require bail, an appearance bond, or set other conditions consistent with this section or section 811.2.\n\nc. An order releasing a child on conditions specified in this section may be amended at any time to impose equally or less restrictive conditions. The order may be amended to impose additional or more restrictive conditions, or to revoke the release, if the child has failed to conform to the conditions originally imposed.\n\n6. If the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the child is within the jurisdiction of the court under this chapter and that full-time detention or shelter care is authorized under section 232.21 or 232.22 or that detention is authorized under section 232.23, it may issue an order authorizing either shelter care or detention until the adjudicatory hearing or trial is held or for a period not exceeding seven days, whichever is shorter. However, in the case of a child placed in detention under section 232.23, this period may be extended by agreement of the parties and the court.\n\n7. If a child held in shelter care or detention by court order has not been released after a detention hearing or has not appeared at an adjudicatory hearing before the expiration of the order of detention, an additional hearing shall automatically be scheduled for the next court day following the expiration of the order. The child, the child’s counsel, the child’s guardian ad litem, and the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian shall be notified of this hearing not less than twenty-four hours before the hearing is scheduled to take place. The hearing required by this subsection may be held by telephone conference call.\n\n8. A child held in a detention or shelter care facility pursuant to section 232.21 or 232.22 under order of court after a hearing may be released upon a showing that a change of circumstances makes continued detention unnecessary.\n\n9. A written request for the release of the child, setting forth the changed circumstances, may be filed by the child, by a responsible adult on the child’s behalf, by the child’s custodian, or by the juvenile court officer.\n\n10. Based upon the facts stated in the request for release the court may grant or deny the request without a hearing, or may order that a hearing be held at a date, time and place determined by the court. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the child and the child’s custodian or counsel. Upon receiving evidence at the hearing, the court may release the child to the child’s custodian or other suitable person, or may deny the request and remand the child to the detention or shelter care facility.\n\n11.

Reasonable notice that states the time, place, and purpose of the waiver hearing shall be provided to the persons required to be provided notice for adjudicatory hearings under section 232.37. Summons, subpoenas, and other process may be issued and served in the same manner as for adjudicatory hearings as provided in section 232.37.\n\n4. Prior to the waiver hearing, the juvenile probation officer or other person or agency designated by the court shall conduct an investigation for the purpose of collecting information relevant to the court’s decision to waive its jurisdiction over the child for the alleged commission of the public offense and shall submit a report concerning the investigation to the court. The report shall include any recommendations made concerning waiver. Prior to the hearing the court shall provide the child’s counsel and the county attorney with access to the report and to all written material to be considered by the court.\n\n5. At the waiver hearing all relevant and material evidence shall be admitted.\n\n6. At the conclusion of the waiver hearing the court may waive its jurisdiction over the child for the alleged commission of the public offense for the purpose of prosecution of the child as an adult if all of the following apply:\n\na. The child is fourteen years of age or older.\n\nb. The court determines, or has previously determined in a detention hearing under section 232.44, that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed a delinquent act which would constitute the public offense.\n\nc. The court determines that the state has established that there are not reasonable prospects for rehabilitating the child if the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over the child and the child is adjudicated to have committed the delinquent act, and that waiver of the court’s jurisdiction over the child for the alleged commission of the public offense would be in the best interests of the child and the community.\n\n7. a. At the conclusion of the waiver hearing and after considering the best interests of the child and the best interests of the community the court may, in order that the child may be prosecuted as a youthful offender, waive its jurisdiction over the child if all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The child is twelve through fifteen years of age or the child is ten or eleven years of age and has been charged with a public offense that would be classified as a class “A” felony if committed by an adult.\n\n(2) The court determines, or has previously determined in a detention hearing under section 232.44, that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed a delinquent act which would constitute a public offense under section 232.8, subsection 1, paragraph “c”, notwithstanding the application of that paragraph to children aged sixteen or older.\n\n(3) The court determines that the state has established that there are not reasonable prospects for rehabilitating the child, prior to the child’s eighteenth birthday, if the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over the child and the child enters into a plea agreement, is a party to a consent decree, or is adjudicated to have committed the delinquent act.\n\nb. The court shall retain jurisdiction over the child for the purpose of determining whether the child should be released from detention under section 232.23. If the court has been apprised of conditions of an agreement between the county attorney and the child which resulted in a motion for waiver for purposes of the child being prosecuted as a youthful offender, and the court finds that the conditions are in the best interests of the child, the conditions of the agreement shall constitute conditions of the waiver order.\n\n8. In making the determination required by subsection 6, paragraph “c”, the factors which the court shall consider include but are not limited to the following:\n\na. The nature of the alleged delinquent act and the circumstances under which it was committed.\n\nb. The nature and extent of the child’s prior contacts with juvenile authorities, including past efforts of such authorities to treat and rehabilitate the child and the response to such efforts.\n\nc.

In making the determination required by subsection 7, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), the factors which the court shall consider include but are not limited to the following:\n\na.

If at the conclusion of the hearing the court waives its jurisdiction over the child for the alleged commission of the public offense, the court shall make and file written findings as to its reasons for waiving its jurisdiction.\n\n11. a. If the court waives jurisdiction, statements made by the child after being taken into custody and prior to intake are admissible as evidence in chief against the child in subsequent criminal proceedings provided that the statements were made with the advice of the child’s counsel or after waiver of the child’s right to counsel and provided that the court finds the child had voluntarily waived the right to remain silent. Other statements made by a child are admissible as evidence in chief provided that the court finds the statements were voluntary. In making its determination, the court may consider any factors it finds relevant and shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) Opportunity for the child to consult with a parent, guardian, custodian, lawyer, or other adult.\n\n(2) The age of the child.\n\n(3) The child’s level of education.\n\n(4) The child’s level of intelligence.\n\n(5) Whether the child was advised of the child’s constitutional rights.\n\n(6) Length of time the child was held in shelter care or detention before making the statement in question.\n\n(7) The nature of the questioning which elicited the statement.\n\n(8) Whether physical punishment such as deprivation of food or sleep was used upon the child during the shelter care, detention, or questioning.\n\nb. Statements made by the child during intake or at a waiver hearing held pursuant to this section are not admissible as evidence in chief against the child in subsequent criminal proceedings over the child’s objection in any event.\n\n12. If the court waives its jurisdiction over the child for the alleged commission of the public offense so that the child may be prosecuted as an adult or a youthful offender, the judge who made the waiver decision shall not preside at any subsequent proceedings in connection with that prosecution if the child objects.\n\n13. The waiver does not apply to other delinquent acts which are not alleged in the delinquency petition presented at the waiver hearing.\n\n14. a. If a child who is alleged to have delivered, manufactured, or possessed with intent to deliver or manufacture, a controlled substance except marijuana, as defined in chapter 124, is waived to district court for prosecution, the mandatory minimum sentence provided in section 124.413 shall not be imposed if a conviction is had; however, each child convicted of such an offense shall be confined for not less than thirty days in a secure facility.\n\nb. Upon application of a person charged or convicted under the authority of this subsection, the district court shall order the records in the case sealed if:\n\n(1) Five years have elapsed since the final discharge of that person; and\n\n(2) The person has not been convicted of a felony or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor, or adjudicated a delinquent for an act which if committed by an adult would be a felony, or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor since the final discharge of that person.\n\n[C79, 81, §232.45]\n\n85 Acts, ch 130, §1, 2; 97 Acts, ch 126, §20 – 23; 2001 Acts, ch 135, §26; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2013 Acts, ch 42, §4, 5\n\nReferred to in §232.8, 232.9, 232.11, 232.22, 232.44, 232.45A, 232.51, 232.89, 232.149B, 803.5, 803.6, 903.1, 904.503, 907.3A, 915.37\n\nAge of majority deemed attained for certain purposes during incarceration following waiver and conviction; see §599.1",

The inclusion of such a determination shall not under any circumstances be deemed a prerequisite for entering an order pursuant to this section. However, the inclusion of such a determination, supported by the record, may be used to assist the department in obtaining federal funding for the child’s placement. If such a determination is included in the order, unless the court makes a determination that further reasonable efforts are not required, reasonable efforts shall be made to prevent permanent removal of a child from the child’s home and to encourage reunification of the child with the child’s parents and family. The reasonable efforts may include but are not limited to early intervention and follow-up programs implemented pursuant to section 232.191.**\n\nb.

If the child does not have a case permanency plan containing the transition plan and needs assessment at the time the transfer order is entered, the written transition plan and needs assessment shall be developed and submitted for the court’s consideration no later than six months from the date of the transfer order. The court shall modify the initial transfer order as necessary to specify the services needed to assist the child in preparing for the transition from foster care to adulthood. If the transition plan identifies services or other support needed to assist the child when the child becomes an adult and the court deems it to be beneficial to the child, the court may authorize the individual who is the child’s guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate to continue a relationship with and provide advice to the child for a period of time beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday.\n\n8. If the court orders the transfer of the custody of the child to the department or to another agency for placement in group foster care, the department or agency shall make every reasonable effort to place the child in the least restrictive, most family-like, and most appropriate setting available and in close proximity to the parents’ home, consistent with the child’s best interests and special needs, and shall consider the placement’s proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement.\n\n9. If a child has previously been adjudicated as a child in need of assistance, and a social worker or other caseworker from the department has been assigned to work on the child’s case, the court may order the department to assign the same social worker or caseworker to work on any matters related to the child arising under this subchapter.\n\n10. a. Upon receipt of an application from the director, the court shall enter an order to temporarily transfer a child who has been placed in the state training school pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “e”, to a facility which has been designated to be an alternative placement site for the state training school, provided the court finds that all of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) There is insufficient time to file a motion and hold a hearing for a substitute dispositional order under section 232.54.\n\n(2) Immediate removal of the child from the state training school is necessary to safeguard the child’s physical or emotional health.\n\n(3) That reasonable attempts to notify the parents, guardian ad litem, and attorney for the child have been made.\n\nb. If the court finds the conditions in paragraph “a” exist and there is insufficient time to provide notice as required under\n\nrule of juvenile procedure 8.12\n\n, the court may enter an ex parte order temporarily transferring the child to the alternative placement site.\n\nc. Within three days of the child’s transfer, the director shall file a motion for a substitute dispositional order under section 232.54 and the court shall hold a hearing concerning the motion within fourteen days of the child’s transfer.\n\n11.

Reasonable efforts shall include but are not limited to giving consideration, if appropriate, to interstate placement of a child in the permanency planning decisions involving the child and giving consideration to in-state and out-of-state placement options at a permanency hearing and when using concurrent planning. If a court order includes a determination that continuation of the child in the child’s home is not appropriate or not possible, reasonable efforts may include the efforts made in a timely manner to finalize a permanency plan for the child.\n\n2.

If an order entered pursuant to this subchapter for an out-of-home placement of a child includes a determination that continuation of the child in the child’s home is contrary to the child’s welfare, the court shall review the child’s continued placement by holding a permanency hearing or hearings in accordance with this section.

For an order for which the court has not waived reasonable efforts requirements, the permanency hearing shall be held within twelve months of the date the child was removed from the home.\n\nb. For an order in a case in which aggravated circumstances exist for which the court has waived reasonable efforts requirements, the permanency hearing shall be held within thirty days of the date the requirements were waived.\n\n2. Reasonable notice shall be provided of a permanency hearing for an out-of-home placement in which the court order has included a determination that continuation of the child in the child’s home is contrary to the child’s welfare. A permanency hearing shall be conducted in substantial conformance with the provisions of section 232.99. During the hearing, the court shall consider the child’s need for a secure and permanent placement in light of any case permanency plan or evidence submitted to the court and the reasonable efforts made concerning the child. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall enter written findings identifying a primary permanency goal for the child. If a case permanency plan is in effect at the time of the hearing, the court shall also make a determination as to whether reasonable progress is being made in achieving the permanency goal and in complying with the other provisions of that case permanency plan.\n\n3. After a permanency hearing, the court shall do one of the following:\n\na. Enter an order pursuant to section 232.52 to return the child to the child’s home.\n\nb. Enter an order pursuant to section 232.52 to continue the out-of-home placement of the child for an additional six months at which time the court shall hold a hearing to consider modification of its permanency order. An order entered under this paragraph shall enumerate the specific factors, conditions, or expected behavioral changes which comprise the basis for the determination that the need for removal of the child from the child’s home will no longer exist at the end of the additional six-month period.\n\nc. Direct the county attorney or the attorney for the child to institute proceedings to terminate the parent-child relationship.\n\nd. Enter an order, pursuant to findings based upon the existence of the evidence required by subsection 5, to do one of the following:\n\n(1) Transfer guardianship and custody of the child to a suitable person.\n\n(2) Transfer sole custody of the child from one parent to another parent.\n\n(3) Transfer custody of the child to a suitable person for the purpose of long-term care.\n\n(4) If the child is sixteen years of age or older and the department has documented to the court’s satisfaction a compelling reason for determining that an order under the other subparagraphs of this paragraph “d” would not be in the child’s best interest, order another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.\n\n4. If the court enters an order for another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “d”, the court shall do all of the following:\n\na. Ask the child about the child’s desired permanency outcome and make a judicial determination that another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child.\n\nb. Require the department to do all of the following:\n\n(1) Document the efforts to place a child permanently with a parent, relative, or in a guardianship or adoptive placement.\n\n(2) Document that the planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child and compelling reasons why it is not in the child’s best interest to be placed permanently with a parent, relative, or in a guardianship or adoptive placement.\n\n(3) Document all of the following at the permanency hearing and the six-month periodic review:\n\n(a) The steps the department is taking to ensure that the planned permanent living arrangement follows the reasonable and prudent parent standard.\n\n(b) Whether the child has regular opportunities to engage in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities.\n\n5. Prior to entering a permanency order pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “d”, clear and convincing evidence must exist showing that all of the following apply:\n\na. A termination of the parent-child relationship would not be in the best interest of the child.\n\nb. Services were offered to the child’s family to correct the situation which led to the child’s removal from the home.\n\nc. The child cannot be returned to the child’s home.\n\n6. Any permanency order may provide restrictions upon the contact between the child and the child’s parent or parents, consistent with the best interest of the child.\n\n7. With respect to a dispositional order made pursuant to section 232.52, subsection 2, paragraph “d”, “e”, or “f”, for which the court has suspended or terminated sibling visitation or interaction, when a review is made under this section the court shall consider whether the visitation or interaction can be safely resumed and may modify the suspension or termination as appropriate.\n\n8. Subsequent to the entry of a permanency order pursuant to this section, the child shall not be returned to the care, custody, or control of the child’s parent or parents, over a formal objection filed by the child’s attorney or guardian ad litem, unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that returning the child to such custody would be in the best interest of the child.\n\n9. Following an initial permanency hearing and the entry of a permanency order which places a child in the custody or guardianship of another person or agency, the court shall retain jurisdiction and annually review the order to ascertain whether the best interest of the child is being served. When the order places the child in the custody of the department for the purpose of a planned permanent living arrangement, the review shall be in a hearing that shall not be waived or continued beyond twelve months after the initial permanency hearing or the last permanency review hearing. Any modification shall be accomplished through a hearing procedure following reasonable notice.

If the department determines a report constitutes a child abuse allegation, the department shall promptly commence either a child abuse assessment within twenty-four hours of receiving the report or a family assessment within seventy-two hours of receiving the report.\n\n(1) Upon acceptance of a report of child abuse, the department shall commence a child abuse assessment when the report alleges child abuse as defined in section 232.68, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) through (3) and subparagraphs (5) through (11), or which alleges child abuse as defined in section 232.68, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4), that also alleges imminent danger, death, or injury to a child.\n\n(2) Upon acceptance of a report of child abuse, the department shall commence a family assessment when the report alleges child abuse as defined in section 232.68, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4), but does not allege imminent danger, death, or injury to a child.\n\nb. The primary purpose of either the child abuse assessment or the family assessment shall be the protection of the child named in the report. The secondary purpose of either type of assessment shall be to engage the child’s family in services to enhance family strengths and to address needs.\n\n2. Notification of parents. The department, within five working days of commencing the assessment, shall provide written notification of the assessment to the child’s parents. If a parent is alleged to have committed the child abuse, the notice shall inform the parents regarding the complaint or allegation made regarding the parent. The parents shall be informed in a manner that protects the confidentiality rights of an individual who reported the child abuse or provided information as part of the assessment process. However, if the department shows the court to the court’s satisfaction that notification is likely to endanger the child or other persons, the court shall orally direct the department to withhold notification. Within one working day of issuing an oral directive, the court shall issue a written order restraining the notification. The department shall not reveal in the written notification to the parents or otherwise the identity of the reporter of child abuse to a subject of a child abuse report listed in section 235A.15, subsection 2, paragraph “a”.\n\n3. Involvement of law enforcement.\n\na. The department shall apply protocols, developed with the local child protection assistance team established pursuant to section 915.35, to prioritize the actions taken in response to a child abuse assessment and shall work jointly with child protection assistance teams and law enforcement agencies in performing assessment and investigative processes for child abuse assessments in which a criminal act harming a child is alleged. The county attorney and appropriate law enforcement agencies shall also take any other lawful action which may be necessary or advisable for the protection of the child.\n\nb. If a report is determined not to constitute a child abuse allegation or if the child abuse report is accepted but assessed under the family assessment, but a criminal act harming a child is alleged, the department shall immediately refer the matter to the appropriate law enforcement agency.\n\nc. If the department has reasonable cause to believe that a child under the placement, care, or supervision of the department is, or is at risk of becoming, a sex trafficking victim, the department shall do all of the following:\n\n(1) Identify the child as a sex trafficking victim or at risk of becoming a sex trafficking victim and include documentation in the child’s department records.\n\n(2) Refer the child for appropriate services.\n\n(3) Refer the child identified as a sex trafficking victim, within twenty-four hours, to the appropriate law enforcement agency having jurisdiction to investigate the allegation.\n\nd.

If at any time during a family assessment, a child is determined unsafe or in imminent danger, it appears that the immediate safety or well-being of a child is endangered, it appears that the family may flee or the child may disappear, or the facts otherwise warrant, the department shall immediately commence a child abuse assessment.\n\n(2) An evaluation of the home environment. If concerns regarding protection of children are identified by the child protection worker, the child protection worker shall evaluate the child named in the report and any other children in the same home as the parents or other persons responsible for their care.\n\nb.

The offer of an interview shall be made to the person prior to any consideration or determination being made that the person committed the alleged abuse. The person shall be informed of the complaint or allegation made regarding the person. The person shall be informed in a manner that protects the confidentiality rights of the individual who reported the child abuse or provided information as part of the assessment process. The purpose of the interview shall be to provide the person with the opportunity to explain or rebut the allegations of the child abuse report or other allegations made during the assessment. The court may waive the requirement to offer the interview only for good cause. The person offered an interview, or the person’s attorney on the person’s behalf, may decline the offer of an interview of the person.\n\n5. Child abuse determination. Unless otherwise prohibited under section 234.40 or 280.21, the use of corporal punishment by the person responsible for the care of a child which does not result in a physical injury to the child shall not be considered child abuse.\n\n6. Home visit. The assessment may, with the consent of the parent or guardian, include a visit to the home of the child named in the report and an interview or observation of the child may be conducted. If permission to enter the home to interview or observe the child is refused, the juvenile court or district court upon a showing of probable cause may authorize the person making the assessment to enter the home and interview or observe the child.\n\n7. Facility or school visit.

Any child aged ten years of age or older can terminate contact with the child protection worker by stating or indicating the child’s wish to discontinue the contact. The immunity granted by section 232.73 applies to acts or omissions in good faith of administrators and their facilities or school districts for cooperating in an assessment and allowing confidential access to a child.\n\n8. Information requests.\n\na. The department may request information from any person believed to have knowledge of a child abuse case. The county attorney, any law enforcement or social services agency in the state, and any mandatory reporter, whether or not the reporter made the specific child abuse report, shall cooperate and assist in the assessment upon the request of the department.\n\nb. In performing an assessment, the department may request criminal history data from the department of public safety on any person believed to be responsible for an injury to a child which, if confirmed, would constitute child abuse. The department shall establish procedures for determining when a criminal history records check is necessary.\n\n9. Protective disclosure. If the department determines that disclosure is necessary for the protection of a child, the department may disclose to a subject of a child abuse report referred to in section 235A.15, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, that an individual is listed in the child or dependent adult abuse registry or is required to register with the sex offender registry in accordance with chapter 692A.\n\n10. Physical examination. If the department refers a child to a physician or physician assistant for a physical examination, the department shall contact the physician or physician assistant regarding the examination within twenty-four hours of making the referral. If the physician or physician assistant who performs the examination upon referral by the department reasonably believes the child has been abused, the physician or physician assistant shall report to the department within twenty-four hours of performing the examination.\n\n11. Multidisciplinary team. In each county or multicounty area in which more than fifty child abuse reports are made per year, the department shall establish a multidisciplinary team, as defined in section 235A.13, subsection 9.

As part of such an assessment, the department shall notify the licensing authority for the facility, the governing body of the facility, and the administrator in charge of the facility of any of the following:\n\n(1) A violation of facility policy noted in the assessment.\n\n(2) An instance in which facility policy or lack of facility policy may have contributed to the reported incident of alleged child abuse.\n\n(3) An instance in which general practice in the facility appears to differ from the facility’s written policy.\n\nb. The licensing authority, the governing body, and the administrator in charge of the facility shall take any lawful action which may be necessary or advisable to protect children receiving care.\n\n13. Written assessment report.\n\na. The department, upon completion of the child abuse assessment or the family assessment, shall make a written report of the assessment, in accordance with all of the following:\n\n(1) The written assessment report shall incorporate the information required by subsection 4, paragraph “a”.\n\n(2) A written child abuse assessment report shall be completed within twenty business days of the receipt of the child abuse report. A written family assessment report shall be completed within ten business days of the receipt of the child abuse report.\n\n(3) The written assessment report shall identify the strengths and needs of the child, and of the child’s parent, home, and family.\n\n(4) The written assessment report shall identify services available from the department and informal and formal services and other support available in the community to address the strengths and needs identified in the assessment.\n\n(5) Upon completion of the assessment, the department shall consult with the child’s family in offering services to the child and the child’s family to address strengths and needs identified in the assessment.\n\nb. In addition to the requirements of paragraph “a”, a written child abuse assessment report shall include a description of the child’s condition, identification of the injury or risk to which the child was exposed, the circumstances which led to the injury or risk to the child, and the identity of any person alleged to be responsible for the injury or risk to the child.\n\nc.

Following a family assessment, the department shall notify the parent or guardian of each child listed in the report of suspected child abuse of the completion of the family assessment and any service recommendations. For cases assessed pursuant to a family assessment, there shall be no right to a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\ne. If after completing the assessment the child protection worker determines, with the concurrence of the worker’s supervisor and the department’s area administrator, that a report of suspected child abuse is a spurious report or that protective concerns are not present, the portions of the written assessment report described under paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (3) and (4) shall not be required.\n\n14. Court-ordered and voluntary services. The department shall provide or arrange for and monitor services for abused children and their families on a voluntary basis or under a final or intermediate order of the juvenile court.

If the department determines that a safety issue continues to require a child to reside outside of the child’s home at the conclusion of a family assessment, the department shall transfer the assessment to the child abuse assessment pathway for a disposition.\n\n16. Conclusion of family assessment. At the conclusion of a family assessment, the department shall transfer the case, if appropriate, to a contracted provider to review the service plan for the child and family. The contracted provider shall make a referral to the department abuse hotline if a family’s noncompliance with a service plan places a child at risk. If any of the criteria for child abuse as defined in section 232.68, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, are met, the department shall commence a child abuse assessment. If any of the criteria for a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96A are met, the department shall determine whether to request a child in need of assistance petition.\n\n17. County attorney — juvenile court. The department shall provide the juvenile court and the county attorney with a copy of the written child abuse assessment report, the written family assessment report for cases in which the department requests a child in need of assistance petition, or other reports for cases in which the department requests a child in need of assistance petition.

Any order entered under this section authorizing temporary removal of a child must include all of the following:\n\na. A determination made by the court that continuation of the child in the child’s home would be contrary to the welfare of the child. Such a determination must be made on a case-by-case basis. The grounds for the court’s determination must be explicitly documented and stated in the order. However, preserving the safety of the child must be the court’s paramount consideration. If imminent danger to the child’s life or health exists at the time of the court’s consideration, the determination shall not be a prerequisite to the removal of the child.\n\nb. A determination made by the court that the necessity of the removal of the child from the child’s home, due to an imminent risk to the child’s life or health, is greater than the potential harm including but not limited to physical, emotional, social, and mental trauma the removal may cause the child.\n\nc. A statement informing the child’s parent that the consequences of a permanent removal may include termination of the parent’s rights with respect to the child.\n\n8. a.

If the juvenile court determines placing custody of the child with any of the child’s parents is not in the child’s best interests, the child’s custody shall be transferred to the department for placement of the child in any of the following categories in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) An adult relative of the child including but not limited to adult siblings and parents of siblings.\n\n(2) A fictive kin.\n\n(3) Any other suitable placement identified by the child’s relatives.\n\n(4) An individual licensed to provide foster care pursuant to chapter 237. If the child is placed with a licensed foster care provider, the department shall assign decision-making authority to the foster care provider for the purpose of applying the reasonable and prudent parent standard during the child’s placement.\n\n(5) A group care facility, shelter care facility, or other residential treatment facility.\n\nb. (1) If the court places custody of the child with the department pursuant to paragraph “a”, the court may identify a category listed in paragraph “a” for placement of the child, but the department shall have the authority to select the specific person or facility within that category for placement, subject to court review at the request of an interested party.\n\n(2) The court shall give deference to the department’s decision for placement of a child. A party opposed to the department’s placement of a child shall have the burden to prove the department failed to act in the child’s best interests by unreasonably or irresponsibly failing to discharge its duties in selecting a suitable placement for the child.\n\nc. A juvenile court shall not order placement of a child in a category listed in paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2), (3), (4), or (5), without a specific finding that placement with a relative is not in the child’s best interests and shall provide reasons for the court’s finding.\n\n9. a. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary including priority in placement of a child under subsection 8, if an ex parte order is requested from the juvenile court under this section pursuant to section 233.2 for transfer of custody of a newborn infant, one of the following shall be applicable:\n\n(1) If physical custody of the newborn infant was not initially relinquished under section 233.2 to an adoption service provider, the department shall request that custody be transferred to the department.\n\n(2) If physical custody of the newborn infant was initially relinquished under section 233.2 to an adoption service provider, the adoption service provider shall request that custody be transferred to the adoption service provider.\n\nb. Upon receiving the order, the department or the adoption service provider shall take custody of the newborn infant and proceed in accordance with chapter 233.\n\nc.

If the child is in the custody of a person other than the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian as the result of action taken pursuant to section 232.78 or 232.79, the court shall hold a hearing within ten days of the date of temporary removal to determine whether the temporary removal should be continued.\n\n2. Upon such hearing, the court may do any of the following:\n\na. Return the child to a person with legal custody of the child pending a final order of disposition.\n\nb. Remove the child from home and place the child with a parent of the child pending a final order of disposition.\n\nc. Remove the child from home and place custody of the child with the department for placement of the child, pending a final order of disposition, in any of the following categories in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) An adult relative of the child including but not limited to adult siblings and parents of siblings.\n\n(2) A fictive kin.\n\n(3) Any other suitable placement identified by the child’s relatives.\n\n(4) An individual licensed to provide foster care pursuant to chapter 237.

The court shall not order placement of a child in a category identified in subsection 2, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (2), (3), (4), or (5), without a specific finding that placement with an adult relative is not in the child’s best interests and providing reasons for the finding.\n\nc.

After a dispositional hearing, the court may enter an order transferring the legal custody of the child to a parent of the child. If the court finds that custody with either of the child’s parents is not in the child’s best interests, the child’s custody shall be transferred to the department for placement of the child in any of the following categories in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) An adult relative of the child including but not limited to adult siblings and parents of siblings.\n\n(2) A fictive kin.\n\n(3) Any other suitable placement identified by the child’s relatives.\n\n(4) An individual licensed to provide foster care pursuant to chapter 237. If the child is placed with a licensed foster care provider, the department shall assign decision-making authority to the foster care provider for the purpose of applying the reasonable and prudent parent standard during the child’s placement.\n\n(5) A group care facility, shelter care facility, or other residential treatment facility.\n\nb. (1) If the court places custody of the child with the department pursuant to paragraph “a”, the court may identify a category listed in paragraph “a” for placement of the child, but the department shall have the authority to select the specific person or facility within that category for placement, subject to court review at the request of an interested party.\n\n(2) The court shall give deference to the department’s decision for placement of a child. A party opposed to the department’s placement of a child shall have the burden to prove the department failed to act in the child’s best interests by unreasonably or irresponsibly failing to discharge its duties in selecting a suitable placement for the child.\n\nc. A court shall not order placement of a child in a category identified in paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) without a specific finding that placement with an adult relative is not in the child’s best interests and providing reasons for the court’s finding.\n\nd. If the child is fourteen years of age or older, the order shall specify the services needed to assist the child in preparing for the transition from foster care to adulthood. If the child has a case permanency plan, the court shall consider the written transition plan of services and needs assessment developed for the child’s case permanency plan. If the child does not have a case permanency plan containing the transition plan and needs assessment at the time the order is entered, the written transition plan and needs assessment shall be developed and submitted for the court’s consideration no later than six months from the date of the transfer order. The court shall modify the initial transfer order as necessary to specify the services needed to assist the child in preparing for the transition from foster care to adulthood. If the transition plan identifies services or other support needed to assist the child when the child becomes an adult and the court deems it to be beneficial to the child, the court may authorize the individual who is the child’s guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate to continue a relationship with and provide advice to the child for a period of time beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday.\n\n2. The court shall not order group foster care placement of the child which is a charge upon the state unless the group foster care meets the requirements established by the department by rule.\n\n3. After a dispositional hearing and upon the request of the department, the court may enter an order appointing the department as the guardian of an unaccompanied refugee child or of a child without parent or guardian.\n\n4. a. Whenever possible the court should permit the child to remain at home with the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian. Custody of the child should not be transferred unless the court finds there is clear and convincing evidence of any of the following:\n\n(1) The child cannot be protected from physical abuse without transfer of custody.\n\n(2) The child cannot be protected from some harm which would justify the adjudication of the child as a child in need of assistance and an adequate placement is available.\n\nb. In order to transfer custody of the child under this subsection, the court must make a determination that continuation of the child in the child’s home would be contrary to the welfare of the child, and shall identify the reasonable efforts that have been made. The court’s determination regarding continuation of the child in the child’s home, and regarding reasonable efforts, including those made to prevent removal and those made to finalize any permanency plan in effect, as well as any determination by the court that reasonable efforts are not required, must be made on a case-by-case basis. The grounds for each determination must be explicitly documented and stated in the court order. However, preserving the safety of the child is the paramount consideration. If imminent danger to the child’s life or health exists at the time of the court’s consideration, the determinations otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be a prerequisite for an order for removal of the child. If the court transfers custody of the child, unless the court waives the requirement for making reasonable efforts or otherwise makes a determination that reasonable efforts are not required, reasonable efforts shall be made to make it possible for the child to safely return to the family’s home.\n\n5. The child shall not be placed in the state training school.\n\n6. In any order transferring custody to the department or an agency, or in orders pursuant to a custody order, the court shall specify the nature and category of disposition which will serve the best interests of the child, and shall prescribe the means by which the placement shall be monitored by the court. If the court orders the transfer of the custody of the child to the department or other agency for placement, the department or agency shall submit a case permanency plan to the court and shall make every reasonable effort to return the child to the child’s home as quickly as possible consistent with the best interests of the child. When the child is not returned to the child’s home and if the child has been previously placed in a licensed foster care facility, the department or agency shall consider placing the child in the same licensed foster care facility. If the court orders the transfer of custody to a parent who does not have physical care of the child, other relative, or other suitable person, the court may direct the department or other agency to provide services to the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian in order to enable them to resume custody of the child. If the court orders the transfer of custody to the department or to another agency for placement in group foster care, the department or agency shall make every reasonable effort to place the child in the least restrictive, most family-like, and most appropriate setting available, and in close proximity to the parents’ home, consistent with the child’s best interests and special needs, and shall consider the placement’s proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement.\n\n7. Any order transferring custody to the department or an agency shall include a statement informing the child’s parent that the consequences of a permanent removal may include the termination of the parent’s rights with respect to the child.\n\n8. An agency, facility, institution, or person to whom custody of the child has been transferred pursuant to this section shall file a written report with the court at least every six months concerning the status and progress of the child. The court shall hold a periodic dispositional review hearing for each child in placement pursuant to this section in order to determine whether the child should be returned home, an extension of the placement should be made, a permanency hearing should be held, or a termination of the parent-child relationship proceeding should be instituted. The placement shall be terminated and the child returned to the child’s home if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child will not suffer harm in the manner specified in section 232.96A. If the placement is extended, the court shall determine whether additional services are necessary to facilitate the return of the child to the child’s home, and if the court determines such services are needed, the court shall order the provision of such services. When the child is not returned to the child’s home and if the child has been previously placed in a licensed foster care facility, the department or agency responsible for the placement of the child shall consider placing the child in the same licensed foster care facility.\n\na. The initial dispositional review hearing shall not be waived or continued beyond six months after the date of the dispositional hearing.\n\nb. Subsequent dispositional review hearings shall not be waived or continued beyond twelve months after the date of the most recent dispositional review hearing.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection, a hearing held pursuant to section 232.103 satisfies the requirements for initial dispositional review or subsequent permanency hearing.\n\n9. Unless prohibited by court order or the department or juvenile court services finds that allowing the visitation would not be in the child’s best interests, the department or juvenile court services may authorize reasonable visitation between the child and the child’s adult relative or a fictive kin.\n\n10. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, transfer of legal custody and placement of a newborn infant for whom physical custody was relinquished pursuant to section 233.2 shall be determined in accordance with chapter 233.\n\n[S13, §254-a20, -a23, 2708, 2709; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §3637, 3646, 3647; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, §232.21, 232.27, 232.28; C66, 71, 73, 75, 77, §232.33; C79, 81, §232.102; 81 Acts, ch 11, §17; 82 Acts, ch 1260, §23]\n\n83 Acts, ch 96, §157, 159; 84 Acts, ch 1279, §16 – 18; 85 Acts, ch 173, §13; 87 Acts, ch 159, §3; 88 Acts, ch 1134, §52; 88 Acts, ch 1249, §14; 90 Acts, ch 1239, §10, 11; 91 Acts, ch 232, §7, 8; 92 Acts, ch 1229, §5\n\n; 92 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1004, §2\n\n; 95 Acts, ch 67, §16; 97 Acts, ch 99, §5; 98 Acts, ch 1190, §11 – 17; 2000 Acts, ch 1067, §10; 2001 Acts, ch 24, §40; 2001 Acts, ch 135, §17 – 19; 2002 Acts, ch 1081, §3; 2003 Acts, ch 117, §5; 2004 Acts, ch 1116, §8 – 10; 2007 Acts, ch 172, §6, 9; 2007 Acts, ch 218, §114; 2008 Acts, ch 1098, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2014 Acts, ch 1092, §52; 2016 Acts, ch 1063, §14, 15; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §31; 2019 Acts, ch 100, §4; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §94; 2022 Acts, ch 1098, §45 – 48, 80; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §622; 2023 Acts, ch 46, §4; 2023 Acts, ch 140, §4\n\nReferred to in §225C.49, 232.2, 232.99, 232.101A, 232.103, 232.104, 232.116, 232.117, 232.127, 232B.5, 233.2, 234.35\n\nCopy of dispositional order under subsection 8 to be submitted to foster care review boards;\n\n84 Acts, ch 1279, §42\n\nLimitation on placing child in mental health institute;\n\n86 Acts, ch 1246, §305\n\nSubsections 4 and 6 amended\n\nFormer subsection 10 stricken\n\nNEW subsection 10",

      "text": "232.102A Reasonable efforts.\n\n1. For the purposes of this subchapter:\n\na. “Reasonable efforts” means the efforts made to preserve and unify a family prior to the out-of-home placement of a child in foster care or to eliminate the need for removal of the child or make it possible for the child to safely return to the family’s home. Reasonable efforts include but are not limited to giving consideration, if appropriate, to interstate placement of a child in the permanency planning decisions involving the child and giving consideration to in-state and out-of-state placement options at a permanency hearing and when using concurrent planning. If returning the child to the family’s home is not appropriate or not possible, reasonable efforts shall include the efforts made in a timely manner to finalize a permanency plan for the child. A child’s health and safety shall be the paramount concern in making reasonable efforts. Reasonable efforts may include but are not limited to family-centered services, if the child’s safety in the home can be maintained during the time the services are provided. In determining whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall consider all of the following:\n\n(1) The type, duration, and intensity of services or support offered or provided to the child and the child’s family. If family-centered services were not provided, the court record shall enumerate the reasons the services were not provided, including but not limited to whether the services were not available, not accepted by the child’s family, judged to be unable to protect the child and the child’s family during the time the services would have been provided, judged to be unlikely to be successful in resolving the problems which would lead to removal of the child, or other services were found to be more appropriate.\n\n(2) The relative risk to the child of remaining in the child’s home versus removal of the child.\n\nb. “Family-centered services” means services and other support intended to safely maintain a child with the child’s family or with an adult relative, to safely and in a timely manner return a child to the home of the child’s parent or relative, or to promote achievement of concurrent planning goals by identifying and helping the child secure placement for adoption, with a guardian, or with other alternative permanent family connections. Family-centered services include services adapted to the individual needs of a family in regard to the specific services and other support provided to the child’s family and the intensity and duration of service delivery and services intended to preserve a child’s connections to the child’s neighborhood, community, and family and to improve the overall capacity of the child’s family to provide for the needs of the children in the family.\n\n2. Family interactions shall continue regardless of a parent’s failure to comply with the requirements of a court order or the department, provided there is no finding by a court or the department that such interaction would be detrimental to the child.\n\n3. The performance of reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a guardian may be made concurrently with making reasonable efforts as defined in this section.\n\n4. If the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that aggravated circumstances exist supported by written findings of fact based upon evidence in the record, the court may waive the requirement for making reasonable efforts. The existence of aggravated circumstances is indicated by any of the following:\n\na. The parent has abandoned the child.\n\nb. The court finds the circumstances described in section 232.116, subsection 1, paragraph “i”, are applicable to the child.\n\nc. The parent’s parental rights have been terminated under section 232.116 or involuntarily terminated by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction in another state with respect to another child who is a member of the same family, and there is clear and convincing evidence to show that the offer or receipt of services would not be likely within a reasonable period of time to correct the conditions which led to the child’s removal.\n\nd. The parent has been convicted of the murder of another child.\n\ne. The parent has been convicted of the voluntary manslaughter of another child.\n\nf. The parent has been convicted of aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring in, or soliciting the commission of the murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child.\n\ng. The parent has been convicted of a felony assault which resulted in serious bodily injury to the child or another child.\n\n5. Prior services the state provided to the family shall not be considered in making a determination as to whether a waiver of reasonable efforts is appropriate.\n\n2022 Acts, ch 1098, §49\n\nReferred to in §232.104, 232.111, 234.6",

Reasonable notice of the hearing shall be given to the parties. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure established for dispositional hearings under section 232.50, subsection 3.\n\n4.

The permanency hearing may be held concurrently with a hearing under section 232.103 to review, modify, substitute, vacate, or terminate a dispositional order.\n\nc. Reasonable notice of a permanency hearing shall be provided to the parties. A permanency hearing shall be conducted in substantial conformance with the provisions of section 232.99. During the hearing, the court shall consider the child’s need for a secure and permanent placement in light of any permanency plan or evidence submitted to the court and the reasonable efforts made concerning the child. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall enter written findings and make a determination identifying a primary permanency goal for the child. If a permanency plan is in effect at the time of the hearing, the court shall also make a determination as to whether reasonable progress is being made in achieving the permanency goal and complying with the other provisions of that permanency plan.\n\n2. After a permanency hearing the court shall do one of the following:\n\na. Enter an order pursuant to section 232.102 to return the child to the child’s home.\n\nb. Enter an order pursuant to section 232.102 to continue placement of the child for an additional six months at which time the court shall hold a hearing to consider modification of its permanency order. An order entered under this paragraph shall enumerate the specific factors, conditions, or expected behavioral changes which comprise the basis for the determination that the need for removal of the child from the child’s home will no longer exist at the end of the additional six-month period.\n\nc. Direct the county attorney or the attorney for the child to institute proceedings to terminate the parent-child relationship.\n\nd. Enter an order, pursuant to findings required by subsection 4, to do one of the following:\n\n(1) Transfer sole custody of the child from one parent to another parent.\n\n(2) Transfer guardianship and custody of the child to an adult relative, a fictive kin, or another suitable person.\n\n(3) Transfer custody of the child to a suitable person for the purpose of long-term care.\n\n(4) If the child is sixteen years of age or older and the department has documented to the court’s satisfaction a compelling reason for determining that an order under the other subparagraphs of this paragraph “d” would not be in the child’s best interest, order another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.\n\n3. If the court enters an order for another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “d”, the court shall do all of the following:\n\na. Ask the child about the child’s desired permanency outcome and make a judicial determination that another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child.\n\nb. Require the department to do all of the following:\n\n(1) Document the efforts to place a child permanently with a parent, relative, or in a guardianship or adoptive placement.\n\n(2) Document that the planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child and compelling reasons why it is not in the child’s best interest to be placed permanently with a parent, relative, or in a guardianship or adoptive placement.\n\n(3) Document all of the following at the permanency hearing and the six-month periodic review:\n\n(a) The steps the department is taking to ensure that the planned permanent living arrangement follows the reasonable and prudent parent standard.\n\n(b) Whether the child has regular opportunities to engage in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities.\n\n4.

A termination of the parent-child relationship would not be in the best interest of the child.\n\nb. Services were offered to the child’s family to correct the situation which led to the child’s removal from the home.\n\nc. The child cannot be returned to the child’s home.\n\n5. A court shall apply the priority of placement requirements of section 232.102, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “c”, when entering a permanency order pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “d”.\n\n6. Any permanency order may provide restrictions upon the contact between the child and the child’s parent or parents, consistent with the best interest of the child.\n\n7. With respect to a dispositional order providing for transfer of custody of a child and siblings to the department or other agency for placement for which the court has suspended or terminated sibling visitation or interaction, when a review is made under this section the court shall consider whether the visitation or interaction can be safely resumed and may modify the suspension or termination as appropriate.\n\n8. Subsequent to the entry of a permanency order pursuant to this section, the child shall not be returned to the care, custody, or control of the child’s parent or parents, over a formal objection filed by the child’s attorney or guardian ad litem, unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, that returning the child to such custody would be in the best interest of the child.\n\n9. a. Following an initial permanency hearing and the entry of a permanency order which places a child in the custody or guardianship of another person or agency, the court shall retain jurisdiction and annually review the order to ascertain whether the best interest of the child is being served. When the order places the child in the custody of the department for the purpose of long-term foster care placement in a facility, the review shall be in a hearing that shall not be waived or continued beyond twelve months after the initial permanency hearing or the last permanency review hearing. Any modification shall be accomplished through a hearing procedure following reasonable notice. During the hearing, all relevant and material evidence shall be admitted and procedural due process shall be provided to all parties.\n\nb.

If at any point the court determines that the child’s visitation or interaction with siblings would be detrimental to the child’s well-being and visitation or interaction with siblings is suspended or terminated by the court, the determination shall be noted in the case permanency plan.

Except as provided in subsection 3, the court may order the termination of both the parental rights with respect to a child and the relationship between the parent and the child on any of the following grounds:\n\na. The parents voluntarily and intelligently consent to the termination of parental rights and the parent-child relationship and for good cause desire the termination.\n\nb. The court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the child has been abandoned or deserted.\n\nc. The court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the child is a newborn infant whose parent has voluntarily released custody of the child in accordance with chapter 233.\n\nd. The court finds that both of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The court has previously adjudicated the child to be a child in need of assistance after finding the child to have been physically or sexually abused or neglected as the result of the acts or omissions of one or both parents, or the court has previously adjudicated a child who is a member of the same family to be a child in need of assistance after such a finding. This paragraph shall not be construed to require that a finding of sexual abuse or neglect requires a finding of a nonaccidental physical injury.\n\n(2) Subsequent to the child in need of assistance adjudication, the parents were offered or received services to correct the circumstance which led to the adjudication, and the circumstance continues to exist despite the offer or receipt of services.\n\ne. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n\n(2) The child has been removed from the physical custody of the child’s parents for a period of at least six consecutive months.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parents have not maintained significant and meaningful contact with the child during the previous six consecutive months and have made no reasonable efforts to resume care of the child despite being given the opportunity to do so. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “significant and meaningful contact” includes but is not limited to the affirmative assumption by the parents of the duties encompassed by the role of being a parent. This affirmative duty, in addition to financial obligations, requires continued interest in the child, a genuine effort to complete the responsibilities prescribed in the case permanency plan, a genuine effort to maintain communication with the child, and requires that the parents establish and maintain a place of importance in the child’s life.\n\nf. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child is four years of age or older.\n\n(2) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n\n(3) The child has been removed from the physical custody of the child’s parents for at least twelve of the last eighteen months, or for the last twelve consecutive months and any trial period at home has been less than thirty days.\n\n(4) There is clear and convincing evidence that at the present time the child cannot be returned to the custody of the child’s parents as provided in section 232.102.\n\ng. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n\n(2) The court has terminated parental rights pursuant to section 232.117 with respect to another child who is a member of the same family or a court of competent jurisdiction in another state has entered an order involuntarily terminating parental rights with respect to another child who is a member of the same family.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent continues to lack the ability or willingness to respond to services which would correct the situation.\n\n(4) There is clear and convincing evidence that an additional period of rehabilitation would not correct the situation.\n\nh. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child is three years of age or younger.\n\n(2) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n\n(3) The child has been removed from the physical custody of the child’s parents for at least six months of the last twelve months, or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home has been less than thirty days.\n\n(4) There is clear and convincing evidence that the child cannot be returned to the custody of the child’s parents as provided in section 232.102 at the present time.\n\ni. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child meets the definition of child in need of assistance based on a finding of physical or sexual abuse or neglect as a result of the acts or omissions of one or both parents. This paragraph shall not be construed to require that a finding of sexual abuse or neglect requires a finding of a nonaccidental physical injury.\n\n(2) There is clear and convincing evidence that the abuse or neglect posed a significant risk to the life of the child or constituted imminent danger to the child.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the offer or receipt of services would not correct the conditions which led to the abuse or neglect of the child within a reasonable period of time.\n\nj. The court finds that both of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96 and custody has been transferred from the child’s parents for placement pursuant to section 232.102.\n\n(2) The parent has been imprisoned for a crime against the child, the child’s sibling, or another child in the household, or the parent has been imprisoned and it is unlikely that the parent will be released from prison for a period of five or more years.\n\nk. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96 and custody has been transferred from the child’s parents for placement pursuant to section 232.102.\n\n(2) The parent has a chronic mental illness and has been repeatedly institutionalized for mental illness, and presents a danger to self or others as evidenced by prior acts.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent’s prognosis indicates that the child will not be able to be returned to the custody of the parent within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and need for a permanent home.\n\nl. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96 and custody has been transferred from the child’s parents for placement pursuant to section 232.102.\n\n(2) The parent has a severe substance use disorder as described by either of the following:\n\n(a) The severe substance use disorder meets the definition for that term as defined in the most current edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual prepared by the American psychiatric association, and the parent presents a danger to self or others as evidenced by prior acts.\n\n(b) The disorder is evidenced by continued and repeated use through the case, the parent’s refusal to obtain a substance use disorder evaluation or treatment after given the opportunity to do so, and the parent presents a danger to self or others as evidenced by prior acts.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent’s prognosis indicates that the child will not be able to be returned to the custody of the parent within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and need for a permanent home.\n\nm. The court finds that both of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96 after finding that the child has been physically or sexually abused or neglected as a result of the acts or omissions of a parent.\n\n(2) The parent found to have physically or sexually abused or neglected the child has been convicted of a felony and imprisoned for physically or sexually abusing or neglecting the child, the child’s sibling, or any other child in the household.\n\nn. The court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n\n(2) The parent has been convicted of child endangerment resulting in the death of the child’s sibling, has been convicted of three or more acts of child endangerment involving the child, the child’s sibling, or another child in the household, or has been convicted of child endangerment resulting in a serious injury to the child, the child’s sibling, or another child in the household.\n\n(3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the circumstances surrounding the parent’s conviction for child endangerment would result in a finding of imminent danger to the child.\n\no. The parent has been convicted of a felony offense that is a sex offense against a minor as defined in section 692A.101, the parent is divorced from or was never married to the minor’s other parent, and the parent is serving a minimum sentence of confinement of at least five years for that offense.\n\np. The court finds there is clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived as the result of sexual abuse as defined in section 709.1, and the biological parent against whom the sexual abuse was perpetrated requests termination of the parental rights of the biological parent who perpetrated the sexual abuse.\n\n2. In considering whether to terminate the rights of a parent under this section, the court shall give primary consideration to the child’s safety, to the best placement for furthering the long-term nurturing and growth of the child, and to the physical, mental, and emotional condition and needs of the child. This consideration may include any of the following:\n\na. Whether the parent’s ability to provide the needs of the child is affected by the parent’s mental capacity or mental condition or the parent’s imprisonment for a felony.\n\nb. For a child who has been placed in foster family care by a court or has been voluntarily placed in foster family care by a parent or by another person, whether the child has become integrated into the foster family to the extent that the child’s familial identity is with the foster family, and whether the foster family is able and willing to permanently integrate the child into the foster family. In considering integration into a foster family, the court shall review the following:\n\n(1) The length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining that environment and continuity for the child.\n\n(2) The reasonable preference of the child, if the court determines that the child has sufficient capacity to express a reasonable preference.\n\nc. The relevant testimony or written statement that a foster parent, relative, or other individual with whom the child has been placed for preadoptive care or other care has a right to provide to the court.\n\n3. The court need not terminate the relationship between the parent and child if the court finds any of the following:\n\na. A relative has legal custody of the child.\n\nb. The child is over ten years of age and objects to the termination.\n\nc. There is clear and convincing evidence that the termination would be detrimental to the child at the time due to the closeness of the parent-child relationship.\n\nd. It is necessary to place the child in a hospital, facility, or institution for care and treatment and the continuation of the parent-child relationship is not preventing a permanent family placement for the child.\n\ne. The absence of a parent is due to the parent’s admission or commitment to any institution, hospital, or health facility or due to active service in the state or federal armed forces.\n\n[C79, §232.114; C81, §232.116]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1279, §19, 20; 86 Acts, ch 1186, §11; 87 Acts, ch 159, §6; 89 Acts, ch 229, §7 – 12; 90 Acts, ch 1251, §28; 92 Acts, ch 1231, §27 – 29; 93 Acts, ch 76, §2; 94 Acts, ch 1174, §3, 22; 95 Acts, ch 182, §10, 11; 98 Acts, ch 1190, §23; 2001 Acts, ch 67, §9, 13; 2006 Acts, ch 1182, §59; 2007 Acts, ch 172, §14; 2008 Acts, ch 1098, §2; 2009 Acts, ch 119, §38; 2011 Acts, ch 121, §58, 62; 2016 Acts, ch 1046, §1; 2022 Acts, ch 1098, §57 – 59; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §625\n\nReferred to in §232.57, 232.102A, 232.111, 232.117\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph l amended",

If the court concludes that facts sufficient to terminate parental rights have not been established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall dismiss the petition.\n\n3. If the court concludes that facts sufficient to sustain the petition have been established by clear and convincing evidence, the court may order parental rights terminated. If the court terminates the parental rights of a child’s parent, the court shall transfer the guardianship and custody of the child to a parent of the child whose parental rights have not been terminated. If the court finds guardianship and custody with the child’s parents is not in the child’s best interests, guardianship and custody shall be transferred for placement of the child in any of the following categories in the following order of priority:\n\na. The department if the department had custody of the child at the time of the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights, or if custody with the department is necessary to facilitate the permanency or adoption goal, unless the department waives its priority.\n\nb.

If after a hearing the court does not order the termination of parental rights but finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the child is a child in need of assistance, pursuant to section 232.96A, due to the acts or omissions of one or both of the child’s parents the court may adjudicate the child to be a child in need of assistance and may enter an order in accordance with the provisions of section 232.100, 232.101, 232.102, or 232.104.\n\n6.

The guardian of each child whose guardianship and custody has been transferred under subsection 3 and who has not been placed for adoption shall file a written report with the court every six months concerning the child’s placement. The court shall hold a hearing to review the placement at intervals not to exceed six months after the date of the termination of parental rights or the last placement review hearing.\n\n8. The guardian of each child whose guardianship and custody has been transferred under subsection 3 and who has been placed for adoption and whose adoption has not been finalized shall file a written report with the court every six months concerning the child’s placement.

The period for request for vacation or appeal by a parent whose rights have been terminated shall not be waived or extended and a vacation or appeal shall not be granted for a request made after the expiration of this period.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the court shall inquire into the ability of the child or the child’s parent to pay expenses incurred pursuant to subsections 2, 4, and 8. After giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the court may order the parent to pay all or part of the costs of the child’s care, examination, treatment, legal expenses, or other expenses. An order entered under this section does not obligate a parent paying child support under a custody decree, except that part of the monthly support payment may be used to satisfy the obligations imposed by the order entered pursuant to this section. If a parent fails to pay as ordered, without good reason, the court may proceed against the parent for contempt and may inform the county attorney who shall proceed against the parent to collect the unpaid amount. Any payment ordered by the court shall be a judgment against each of the child’s parents and a lien as provided in section 624.23. If all or part of the amount that the parents are ordered to pay is subsequently paid by the county or state, the judgment and lien shall thereafter be against each of the parents in favor of the county to the extent of the county’s payments and in favor of the state to the extent of the state’s payments.\n\n2.

Reasonable compensation for an attorney appointed by the court to serve as counsel to any party or as guardian ad litem for any child in juvenile court.\n\nc. Fees and expenses incurred by the juvenile court for foreign language interpreters for court proceedings.\n\n3. Costs incurred under subsection 2 shall be paid as follows:\n\na. A county shall be required to pay for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1989, an amount equal to the county’s base cost for witness and mileage fees and attorney fees established pursuant to section 232.141, subsection 8, paragraph “d”, Code 1989, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1988, plus an amount equal to the percentage rate of change in the consumer price index as tabulated by the federal bureau of labor statistics for the current year times the county’s base cost.\n\nb. A county’s base cost for a fiscal year plus the percentage rate of change amount as computed in paragraph “a” is the county’s base cost for the succeeding fiscal year. The amount to be paid in the succeeding year by the county shall be computed as provided in paragraph “a”.\n\nc. The county, on an annual basis, shall pay to the indigent defense fund created under section 815.11 the amount of the county’s base cost as determined in accordance with this subsection.\n\nd. Costs incurred under subsection 2 shall be paid by the state from the appropriations to the indigent defense fund under section 815.11 in accordance with this chapter, chapter 815, and the rules adopted by the state public defender. The county shall be required to reimburse the indigent defense fund for costs incurred by the state up to the county’s base in this subsection.\n\n4. Upon certification of the court, all of the following expenses are a charge upon the state to the extent provided in subsection 5:\n\na. The expenses of transporting a child to or from a place designated by the court for the purpose of care or treatment.\n\nb. Expenses for mental or physical examinations of a child if ordered by the court.\n\nc. The expenses of care or treatment ordered by the court.\n\n5. If no other provision of law requires the county to reimburse costs incurred pursuant to subsection 4, the department shall reimburse the costs as follows:\n\na. The department shall prescribe by administrative rule all services eligible for reimbursement pursuant to subsection 4 and shall establish an allowable rate of reimbursement for each service.\n\nb. The department shall receive billings for services provided and, after determining allowable costs, shall reimburse providers at a rate which is not greater than allowed by administrative rule. Reimbursement paid to a provider by the department shall be considered reimbursement in full unless a county voluntarily agrees to pay any difference between the reimbursement amount and the actual cost. When there are specific program regulations prohibiting supplementation those regulations shall be applied to providers requesting supplemental payments from a county. Billings for services not listed in administrative rule shall not be paid. However, if the court orders a service not currently listed in administrative rule, the department shall review the order and, if reimbursement for the service of the department is not in conflict with other law or administrative rule, and meets the criteria of subsection 4, the department shall reimburse the provider.\n\n6. If a child is given physical or mental examinations or treatment relating to an assessment performed pursuant to section 232.71B with the consent of the child’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian and no other provision of law otherwise requires payment for the costs of the examination and treatment, the costs shall be paid by the state. Reimbursement for costs of services described in this subsection is subject to subsection 5.\n\n7. A county charged with the costs and expenses under subsections 2 and 3 may recover the costs and expenses from the child’s custodial parent’s county of residence, as defined in section 225C.61, by filing verified claims which are payable as are other claims against the county. A detailed statement of the facts upon which a claim is based shall accompany the claim.\n\n8. This subsection applies only to placements in a juvenile shelter care home which is publicly owned, operated as a county or multicounty shelter care home, organized under a chapter 28E agreement, or operated by a private juvenile shelter care home. If the actual and allowable costs of a child’s shelter care placement exceed the amount the department is authorized to pay, the unpaid costs may be recovered from the child’s custodial parent’s county of residence. However, the maximum amount of the unpaid costs which may be recovered under this subsection is limited to the difference between the amount the department is authorized to pay and the statewide average of the actual and allowable rates as reasonably determined by the department annually. A home may only be reimbursed for the lesser of the home’s actual and allowable costs or the statewide average of the actual and allowable rates as determined by the department in effect on the date the costs were paid. The unpaid costs are payable pursuant to filing of verified claims against the child’s custodial parent’s county of residence. A detailed statement of the facts upon which a claim is based shall accompany the claim.

      "text": "232.158 Interstate compact on placement of children.\n\nThe interstate compact on the placement of children is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in form substantially as follows:\n\n1. Article I — Purpose and policy. It is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:\n\na. Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.\n\nb. The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.\n\nc. The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.\n\nd. Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.\n\n2. Article II — Definitions. As used in this compact:\n\na. “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.\n\nb. “Sending agency” means a party state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.\n\nc. “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.\n\nd. “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution, but not in an institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective, or epileptic, in an institution primarily educational in character, or in a hospital or other medical facility.\n\n3. Article III — Conditions for placement.\n\na. A sending agency shall not send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state a child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency complies with every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children in the receiving state.\n\nb. Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:\n\n(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.\n\n(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.\n\n(3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring or place the child.\n\n(4) A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.\n\nc. Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph “b” of this article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency’s state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.\n\nd. The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.\n\n4. Article IV — Penalty for illegal placement. The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.\n\n5. Article V — Retention of jurisdiction.\n\na. The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency’s state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.\n\nb. When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.\n\nc. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph “a” hereof.\n\n6. Article VI — Institutional care of delinquent children. A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to the child being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:\n\na. Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s jurisdiction; and\n\nb. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.\n\n7. Article VII — Compact administrator. The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of activities under this compact in the officer’s jurisdiction and who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\n8. Article VIII — Limitations. This compact shall not apply to:\n\na. The sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state by the child’s parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or sister, adult uncle or aunt, or guardian and leaving the child with any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.\n\nb. Any placement, sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are party, or to any other agreement between said states which has the force of law.\n\n9. Article IX — Enactment and withdrawal. This compact shall be open to joinder by any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress, the government of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become effective with respect to any such jurisdiction when such jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n10. Article X — Construction and severability. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n[S13, §3260-1; C24, §3672, 3675; C27, 31, 35, §3661-a90, -a93, -a95, -a96; C39, §3661.104, 3661.107, 3661.109, 3661.110; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, §238.33, 238.36, 238.38, 238.39; C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §238.33]\n\n85 Acts, ch 173, §21 – 23, 30\n\nCS85, §232.158\n\n2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201\n\nReferred to in §232.158A, 232.159, 232.160, 232.161, 232.162, 232.163, 232.164, 232.165, 232.166, 232.167, 422.12A",

      "text": "232.171 Interstate compact on juveniles.\n\nThe state of Iowa through its courts and agencies is hereby authorized to enter into interstate compacts on juveniles in behalf of this state with any other contracting state which legally joins therein in substantially the following form and the contracting states solemnly agree:\n\n1. Article I — Findings and purposes. That juveniles who are not under proper supervision and control, or who have absconded, escaped or run away, are likely to endanger their own health, morals and welfare, and the health, morals and welfare of others. The cooperation of the states party to this compact is therefore necessary to provide for the welfare and protection of juveniles and of the public with respect to\n\na. Cooperative supervision of delinquent juveniles on probation or parole;\n\nb. The return, from one state to another, of delinquent juveniles who have escaped or absconded;\n\nc. The return, from one state to another, of nondelinquent juveniles who have run away from home; and\n\nd. Additional measures for the protection of juveniles and of the public, which any two or more of the party states may find desirable to undertake cooperatively. In carrying out the provisions of this compact the party states shall be guided by the noncriminal, reformative and protective policies which guide their laws concerning delinquent, neglected or dependent juveniles generally. It shall be the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and observe their respective responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles and delinquent juveniles who become subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the foregoing purposes.\n\n2. Article II — Existing rights and remedies. That all remedies and procedures provided by this compact shall be in addition to and not in substitution for other rights, remedies and procedures, and shall not be in derogation of parental rights and responsibilities.\n\n3. Article III — Definitions. That, for the purposes of this compact, “delinquent juvenile” means any juvenile who has been adjudged delinquent and who, at the time the provisions of this compact are invoked, is still subject to the jurisdiction of the court that has made such adjudication or to the jurisdiction or supervision of an agency or institution pursuant to an order of such court; “probation or parole” means any kind of conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the states party hereto; “court” means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected or dependent children; “state” means any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and “residence” or any variant thereof means a place at which a home or regular place of abode is maintained.\n\n4. Article IV — Return of runaways.\n\na. (1) That the parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to legal custody of a juvenile who has not been adjudged delinquent but who has run away without the consent of such parent, guardian, or person or agency may petition the appropriate court in the demanding state for the issuance of a requisition for the juvenile’s return. The petition shall state the name and age of the juvenile, the name of the petitioner and the basis of entitlement to the juvenile’s custody, the circumstances of the juvenile’s running away, the juvenile’s location if known at the time application is made, and such other facts as may tend to show that the juvenile who has run away is endangering the juvenile’s own welfare or the welfare of others and is not an emancipated minor. The petition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two certified copies of the document or documents on which the petitioner’s entitlement to the juvenile’s custody is based, such as birth certificates, letters of guardianship, or custody decrees. Such further affidavits and other documents as may be deemed proper may be submitted with such petition. The judge of the court to which this application is made may hold a hearing thereon to determine whether for the purposes of this compact the petitioner is entitled to the legal custody of the juvenile, whether or not it appears that the juvenile has in fact run away without consent, whether or not the juvenile is an emancipated minor, and whether or not it is in the best interest of the juvenile to compel the juvenile’s return to the state. If the judge determines, either with or without a hearing, that the juvenile should be returned, the judge shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of such juvenile. Such requisition shall set forth the name and age of the juvenile, the determination of the court that the juvenile has run away without the consent of a parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to the juvenile’s legal custody, and that it is in the best interest and for the protection of such juvenile that the juvenile be returned. In the event that a proceeding for the adjudication of the juvenile as a delinquent, neglected or dependent juvenile is pending in the court at the time when such juvenile runs away, the court may issue a requisition for the return of such juvenile upon its own motion, regardless of the consent of the parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to legal custody, reciting therein the nature and circumstances of the pending proceeding. The requisition shall in every case be executed in duplicate and shall be signed by the judge. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of such court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a juvenile who has run away, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing the officer or person to take into custody and detain such juvenile. Such detention order must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance hereunder. No juvenile detained upon such order shall be delivered over to the officer whom the court demanding the juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile, unless the juvenile shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of a court in the state, who shall inform the juvenile of the demand made for the juvenile’s return, and who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the juvenile. If the judge of such court shall find that the requisition is in order, the judge shall deliver such juvenile over to the officer whom the court demanding the juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding.\n\n(2) Upon reasonable information that a person is a juvenile who has run away from another state party to this compact without the consent of a parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to the juvenile’s legal custody, such juvenile may be taken into custody without a requisition and brought forthwith before a judge of the appropriate court who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for such juvenile and who shall determine after a hearing whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person, subject to the order of the court, for the person’s own protection and welfare, for such a time not exceeding ninety days as will enable the person’s return to another state party to this compact pursuant to a requisition for the person’s return from a court of that state. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a juvenile who has run away, there is pending in the state wherein the juvenile is found any criminal charge, or any proceeding to have the juvenile adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in such state, or if the juvenile is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, the juvenile shall not be returned without the consent of such state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for such offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport such juvenile through any and all states party to this compact, without interference. Upon the juvenile’s return to the state from which the juvenile ran away, the juvenile shall be subject to such further proceedings as may be appropriate under the laws of that state.\n\nb. That the state to which a juvenile is returned under this article shall be responsible for payment of the transportation costs of such return.\n\nc. That “juvenile” as used in this article means any person who is a minor under the law of the state of residence of the parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to the legal custody of such minor.\n\n5. Article V — Return of escapees and absconders.\n\na. (1) That the appropriate person or authority from whose probation or parole supervision a delinquent juvenile has absconded or from whose institutional custody the delinquent juvenile has escaped shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the delinquent juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of such delinquent juvenile. Such requisition shall state the name and age of the delinquent juvenile, the particulars of the juvenile’s adjudication as a delinquent juvenile, the circumstances of the breach of the terms of the juvenile’s probation or parole or of the juvenile’s escape from an institution or agency vested with the juvenile’s legal custody or supervision, and the location of such delinquent juvenile, if known, at the time the requisition is made. The requisition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two certified copies of the judgment, formal adjudication, or order of commitment which subjects such delinquent juvenile to probation or parole or to the legal custody of the institution or agency concerned. Such further affidavits and other documents as may be deemed proper may be submitted with such requisition. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of the appropriate court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a delinquent juvenile who has absconded or escaped, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing the officer or person to take into custody and detain such delinquent juvenile. Such detention order must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance hereunder. No delinquent juvenile detained upon such order shall be delivered over to the officer whom the appropriate person or authority demanding the juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile, unless the juvenile shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of an appropriate court in the state, who shall inform the juvenile of the demand made for the juvenile’s return and who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the juvenile. If the judge of such court shall find that the requisition is in order, the judge shall deliver such delinquent juvenile over to the officer whom the appropriate person or authority demanding the juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding.\n\n(2) Upon reasonable information that a person is a delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with the person’s legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, such person may be taken into custody in any other state party to this compact without a requisition. But in such event, the person must be taken forthwith before a judge of the appropriate court, who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for such person and who shall determine, after a hearing, whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person subject to the order of the court for such a time, not exceeding ninety days, as will enable the person’s detention under a detention order issued on a requisition pursuant to this article. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a delinquent juvenile who has either absconded while on probation or parole or escaped from an institution or agency vested with the juvenile’s legal custody or supervision, there is pending in the state wherein the juvenile is detained any criminal charge or any proceeding to have the juvenile adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in such state, or if the juvenile is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, the juvenile shall not be returned without the consent of such state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for such offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the delinquent juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport such delinquent juvenile through any and all states party to this compact, without interference. Upon the juvenile’s return to the state from which the juvenile escaped or absconded, the delinquent juvenile shall be subject to such further proceedings as may be appropriate under the laws of that state.\n\nb. That the state to which a delinquent juvenile is returned under this article shall be responsible for payment of the transportation costs of such return.\n\n6. Article VI — Voluntary return procedure. That any delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with the juvenile’s legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, and any juvenile who has run away from any state party to this compact, who is taken into custody without a requisition in another state party to this compact under the provisions of article IV, paragraph “a”, or of article V, paragraph “a”, may consent to the juvenile’s immediate return to the state from which the juvenile absconded, escaped or ran away. Such consent shall be given by the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and the juvenile’s counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, by executing or subscribing a writing, in the presence of a judge of the appropriate court, which states that the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and the juvenile’s counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, consent to the juvenile’s return to the demanding state. Before such consent shall be executed or subscribed, however, the judge, in the presence of counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, shall inform the juvenile or delinquent juvenile of the juvenile’s rights under this compact. When the consent has been duly executed, it shall be forwarded to and filed with the compact administrator of the state in which the court is located and the judge shall direct the officer having the juvenile or delinquent juvenile in custody to deliver the juvenile to the duly accredited officer or officers of the state demanding the juvenile’s return, and shall cause to be delivered to such officer or officers a copy of the consent. The court may, however, upon the request of the state to which the juvenile or delinquent juvenile is being returned, order the juvenile to return unaccompanied to such state and shall provide the juvenile with a copy of such court order; in such event a copy of the consent shall be forwarded to the compact administrator of the state to which said juvenile or delinquent juvenile is ordered to return.\n\n7. Article VII — Cooperative supervision of probationers and parolees.\n\na. That the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact, herein called “sending state”, may permit any delinquent juvenile within such state, placed on probation or parole, to reside in any other state party to this compact, herein called “receiving state”, while on probation or parole, and the receiving state shall accept such delinquent juvenile, if the parent, guardian, or person entitled to the legal custody of such delinquent juvenile is residing or undertakes to reside within the receiving state. Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be given to the receiving state to make such investigations as it deems necessary. The authorities of the sending state shall send to the authorities of the receiving state copies of pertinent court orders, social case studies and all other available information which may be of value to and assist the receiving state in supervising a probationer or parolee under this compact. A receiving state, in its discretion, may agree to accept supervision of a probationer or parolee in cases where the parent, guardian, or person entitled to the legal custody of the delinquent juvenile is not a resident of the receiving state, and if so accepted the sending state may transfer supervision accordingly.\n\nb. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation and of supervision over any such delinquent juvenile and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards of visitation and supervision that prevail for its own delinquent juveniles released on probation or parole.\n\nc. That, after consultation between the appropriate authorities of the sending state and of the receiving state as to the desirability and necessity of returning such a delinquent juvenile, the duly accredited officers of a sending state may enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any such delinquent juvenile on probation or parole. For that purpose, no formalities will be required, other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the delinquent juvenile to be retaken and returned. The decision of the sending state to retake a delinquent juvenile on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if, at the time the sending state seeks to retake a delinquent juvenile on probation or parole, there is pending against the juvenile within the receiving state any criminal charge or any proceeding to have the juvenile adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for any act committed in such state, or if the juvenile is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, the juvenile shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for such offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport delinquent juveniles being so returned through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.\n\nd. That the sending state shall be responsible under this article for paying the costs of transporting any delinquent juvenile to the receiving state or of returning any delinquent juvenile to the sending state.\n\n8. Article VIII — Responsibility for costs.\n\na. That the provisions of article IV, paragraph “b”, article V, paragraph “b”, and article VII, paragraph “d” of this compact shall not be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n\nb. That nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to article IV, paragraph “b”, article V, paragraph “b”, or article VII, paragraph “d” of this compact.\n\n9. Article IX — Detention practices. That, to every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no juvenile or delinquent juvenile shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup nor be detained or transported in association with criminal, vicious or dissolute persons.\n\n10. Article X — Supplementary agreements. That the duly constituted administrative authorities of a state party to this compact may enter into supplementary agreements with any other state or states party hereto for the cooperative care, treatment and rehabilitation of delinquent juveniles whenever they shall find that such agreements will improve the facilities or programs available for such care, treatment and rehabilitation. Such care, treatment and rehabilitation may be provided in an institution located within any state entering into such supplementary agreement. Such supplementary agreements shall:\n\na. Provide the rates to be paid for the care, treatment and custody of such delinquent juveniles, taking into consideration the character of facilities, services and subsistence furnished;\n\nb. Provide that the delinquent juvenile shall be given a court hearing prior to the juvenile being sent to another state for care, treatment and custody;\n\nc. Provide that the state receiving such a delinquent juvenile in one of its institutions shall act solely as agent for the state sending such delinquent juvenile;\n\nd. Provide that the sending state shall at all times retain jurisdiction over delinquent juveniles sent to an institution in another state;\n\ne. Provide for reasonable inspection of such institutions by the sending state;\n\nf. Provide that the consent of the parent, guardian, or person or agency entitled to the legal custody of the delinquent juvenile shall be secured prior to the juvenile being sent to another state; and\n\ng. Make provision for such other matters and details as shall be necessary to protect the rights and equities of such delinquent juveniles and of the cooperating states.\n\n11. Article XI — Acceptance of federal and other aid. That any state party to this compact may accept any and all donations, gifts and grants of money, equipment and services from the federal or any local government, or any agency thereof and from any person, firm or corporation, for any of the purposes and functions of this compact, and may receive and utilize the same subject to the terms, conditions and regulations governing such donations, gifts and grants.\n\n12. Article XII — Compact administrators. That the governor of each state party to this compact shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\n13. Article XIII — Execution of compact. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.\n\n14. Article XIV — Renunciation. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months’ notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto. The duties and obligations of a renouncing state under article VII hereof shall continue as to parolees and probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged. Supplementary agreements entered into under article X hereof shall be subject to renunciation as provided by such supplementary agreements, and shall not be subject to the six months’ renunciation notice of the present article.\n\n15. Article XV — Rendition amendment.\n\na. This article shall provide additional remedies, and shall be binding only as among and between those party states which specifically execute the same.\n\nb. All provisions and procedures of articles V and VI of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles shall be construed to apply to any juvenile charged with being a delinquent by reason of a violation of any criminal law. Any juvenile charged with being a delinquent by reason of violating any criminal law shall be returned to the requesting state upon a requisition to the state where the juvenile may be found. A petition in such case shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction in the requesting state where the violation of criminal law is alleged to have been committed. The petition may be filed regardless of whether the juvenile has left the state before or after the filing of the petition. The requisition described in article V of the compact shall be forwarded by the judge of the court in which the petition has been filed.\n\n16. Out-of-state confinement amendment.\n\na. Whenever the duly constituted judicial or administrative authorities in a sending state shall determine that confinement of a probationer or reconfinement of a parolee is necessary or desirable, said officials may direct that the confinement or reconfinement be in an appropriate institution for delinquent juveniles within the territory of the receiving state, such receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n\nb. Escapees and absconders who would otherwise be returned pursuant to article V of the compact may be confined or reconfined in the receiving state pursuant to this amendment. In any such case the information and allegations required to be made and furnished in a requisition pursuant to such article shall be made and furnished, but in place of the demand pursuant to article V, the sending state shall request confinement or reconfinement in the receiving state. Whenever applicable, detention orders as provided in article V may be employed pursuant to this paragraph preliminary to disposition of the escapee or absconder.\n\nc. The confinement or reconfinement of a parolee, probationer, escapee, or absconder pursuant to this amendment shall require the concurrence of the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the receiving state.\n\nd. As used in this amendment:\n\n(1) “Sending state” means sending state as that term is used in article VII of the compact or the state from which a delinquent juvenile has escaped or absconded within the meaning of article V of the compact.\n\n(2) “Receiving state” means any state, other than the sending state, in which a parolee, probationer, escapee, or absconder may be found, provided that said state is a party to this amendment.\n\ne. Every state which adopts this amendment shall designate at least one of its institutions for delinquent juveniles as a “compact institution” and shall confine persons therein as provided in paragraph “a” hereof unless the sending and receiving state in question shall make specific contractual arrangements to the contrary. All states party to this amendment shall have access to “compact institutions” at all reasonable hours for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and for the purpose of visiting such of said state’s delinquents as may be confined in the institution.\n\nf. Persons confined in “compact institutions” pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed from said “compact institution” for transfer to an appropriate institution within the sending state, for return to probation or parole, for discharge or for any purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state.\n\ng. All persons who may be confined in a “compact institution” pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner. The fact of confinement or reconfinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any person so confined or reconfined of any rights which said person would have had if confined or reconfined in an appropriate institution of the sending state; nor shall any agreement to submit to confinement or reconfinement pursuant to the terms of this amendment be construed as a waiver of any rights which the delinquent would have had if the delinquent had been confined or reconfined in any appropriate institution of the sending state except that the hearing or hearings, if any, to which a parolee, probationer, escapee, or absconder may be entitled, prior to confinement or reconfinement, by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate judicial or administrative officers of the receiving state. In this event, said judicial and administrative officers shall act as agents of the sending state after consultation with appropriate officers of the sending state.\n\nh. Any receiving state incurring costs or other expenses under this amendment shall be reimbursed in the amount of such costs or other expenses by the sending state unless the states concerned shall specifically otherwise agree. Any two or more states party to this amendment may enter into supplementary agreements determining a different allocation of costs as among themselves.\n\ni. This amendment shall take initial effect when entered into by any two or more states party to the compact and shall be effective as to those states which have specifically enacted this amendment. Rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the terms of this amendment may be promulgated by the appropriate officers of those states which have enacted this amendment.\n\n[C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, §231.14; C79, 81, §232.139]\n\n85 Acts, ch 182, §1\n\nCS85, §232.171\n\n2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §639 – 641\n\nReferred to in §232.172\n\nSee §232.172 for limitations on applicability of this section\n\nSubsection 4 amended\n\nSubsection 7, paragraph a amended\n\nSubsection 10, paragraph f amended",

The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. §112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nb. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:\n\n(1) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state.\n\n(2) Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected.\n\n(3) Return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return.\n\n(4) Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services.\n\n(5) Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles.\n\n(6) Equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states.\n\n(7) Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders.\n\n(8) Insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines.\n\n(9) Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact.\n\n(10) Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators.\n\n(11) Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance.\n\n(12) Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity.\n\n(13) Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.\n\nc. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created in this compact are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.\n\n2. Article II — Definitions.

The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\n(4) Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council of such termination.\n\n(5) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(6) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(7) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nc. Judicial enforcement. The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default.

      "text": "232.188 Decategorization of child welfare and juvenile justice funding initiative.\n\n1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Decategorization governance board” or “governance board” means the group that enters into and implements a decategorization project agreement.\n\nb. “Decategorization project” means the county or counties that have entered into a decategorization agreement to implement the decategorization initiative in the county or multicounty area covered by the agreement.\n\nc. “Decategorization services funding pool” or “funding pool” means the funding designated for a decategorization project from all sources.\n\n2. Purpose. The decategorization of the child welfare and juvenile justice funding initiative is intended to establish a system of delivering human services based upon client needs to replace a system based upon a multitude of categorical programs and funding sources, each with different service definitions and eligibility requirements. The purposes of the decategorization initiative include but are not limited to redirecting child welfare and juvenile justice funding to services which are more preventive, family-centered, and community-based in order to reduce use of restrictive approaches which rely upon institutional, out-of-home, and out-of-community services.\n\n3. Implementation.\n\na. Implementation of the initiative shall be through creation of decategorization projects. A project shall consist of either a single county or a group of counties interested in jointly implementing the initiative. Representatives of the department, juvenile court services, and county government shall develop a project agreement to implement the initiative within a project.\n\nb. The initiative shall include community planning activities in the area covered by a project. As part of the community planning activities, the department shall partner with other community stakeholders to develop service alternatives that provide less restrictive levels of care for children and families receiving services from the child welfare and juvenile justice systems within the project area.\n\nc. The decategorization initiative shall not be implemented in a manner that limits the legal rights of children and families to receive services.\n\n4. Governance board.\n\na. In partnership with an interested county or group of counties which has demonstrated the commitment and involvement of the affected county department, or departments, of human services, the juvenile justice system within the project area, and board, or boards, of supervisors in order to form a decategorization project, the department shall develop a process for combining specific state and state-federal funding categories into a decategorization services funding pool for that project. A decategorization project shall be implemented by a decategorization governance board. The decategorization governance board shall develop specific, quantifiable short-term and long-term plans for enhancing the family-centered and community-based services and reducing reliance upon out-of-community care in the project area.\n\nb. The department shall work with the decategorization governance boards to best coordinate planning activities and most effectively target funding resources. The department shall work with the decategorization governance boards to support board planning and service development activities and to promote the most effective alignment of resources.\n\nc. A decategorization governance board shall coordinate the project’s planning and budgeting activities with the department’s designee for the county or counties comprising the project area and the early childhood Iowa area board or boards for the early childhood Iowa area or areas within which the decategorization project is located.\n\n5. Funding pool.\n\na. The governance board for a decategorization project has authority over the project’s decategorization services funding pool and shall manage the pool to provide more flexible, individualized, family-centered, preventive, community-based, comprehensive, and coordinated service systems for children and families served in that project area. A funding pool shall also be used for child welfare and juvenile justice systems enhancements.\n\nb. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys designated for a project’s decategorization services funding pool that remain unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure as directed by the project’s governance board for child welfare and juvenile justice systems enhancements and other purposes of the project for the next three succeeding fiscal years. Such moneys shall be known as “carryover funding”. Moneys may be made available to a funding pool from one or more of the following sources:\n\n(1) Funds designated for the initiative in a state appropriation.\n\n(2) Child welfare and juvenile justice services funds designated for the initiative by the department.\n\n(3) Juvenile justice program funds designated for the initiative by a chief juvenile court officer.\n\n(4) Carryover funding.\n\n(5) Any other source designating moneys for the funding pool.\n\nc. The services and activities funded from a project’s funding pool may vary depending upon the strategies selected by the project’s governance board and shall be detailed in an annual child welfare and juvenile justice decategorization services plan developed by the governance board. A decategorization governance board shall involve community representatives and county organizations in the development of the plan for that project’s funding pool. In addition, the governance board shall coordinate efforts through communication with the department regarding budget planning and decategorization service decisions.\n\nd. A decategorization governance board is responsible for ensuring that decategorization services expenditures from that project’s funding pool do not exceed the amount of funding available. If necessary, the governance board shall reduce expenditures or discontinue specific services as necessary to manage within the funding pool resources available for a fiscal year.\n\ne. The annual child welfare and juvenile justice decategorization services plan developed for use of the funding pool by a decategorization governance board shall be submitted to the department and the early childhood Iowa state board. In addition, the decategorization governance board shall submit an annual progress report to the department and the early childhood Iowa state board which summarizes the progress made toward attaining the objectives contained in the plan. The progress report shall serve as an opportunity for information sharing and feedback.\n\n6. Departmental role. The departmental share of the child welfare appropriation that is not allocated by law for the decategorization initiative shall be managed by and is under the authority of the department. The department is responsible for meeting the child welfare service needs with the available funding resources.\n\n92 Acts, ch 1229, §18; 98 Acts, ch 1206, §11, 20; 99 Acts, ch 111, §10; 99 Acts, ch 190, §16; 99 Acts, ch 192, §33; 2004 Acts, ch 1116, §14; 2005 Acts, ch 95, §1; 2010 Acts, ch 1031, §297; 2011 Acts, ch 129, §90, 156; 2017 Acts, ch 29, §54; 2022 Acts, ch 1098, §69; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §642\n\nReferred to in §225C.49, 235.7, 237A.1, 249A.26\n\nSection amended",
