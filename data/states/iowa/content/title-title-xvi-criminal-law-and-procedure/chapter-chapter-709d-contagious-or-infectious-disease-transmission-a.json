Evidence that a person knows the person is infected with a contagious or infectious disease and has engaged in conduct that exposes others to the contagious or infectiousdisease, regardless of the frequency of the conduct, is insufficient on its own to prove theintent to transmit the contagious or infectious disease. 7. A person does not act with the intent required pursuant to subsection 1 or 2, or with the reckless disregard required pursuant to subsection 3 or 4, if the person takes practical meansto prevent transmission, or if the person informs the uninfected person that the person hasa contagious or infectious disease and offers to take practical means to prevent transmissionbut that offer is rejected by the uninfected person subsequently exposed to the infectious orcontagious disease. 8. It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section if the person exposed to the contagious or infectious disease knew that the infected person was infected with thecontagious or infectious disease at the time of the exposure and consented to exposure withthat knowledge. 2014 Acts, ch 1119, §3, 11 Sat Dec 23 12:28:38 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 709D.3 (11, 0)",
