(2) Where testing under subparagraph (1) creates a documented hardship or is geographically impractical, by an alternative method approved by the department andconsistent with this section where a timely sanction can be effectively applied. 2. A person wishing to participate in the program who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted of an eligible offense, but has not been required by a court orgovernmental entity to participate in the program, may apply to the court or governmentalentity of the participating jurisdiction on a form created by the participating jurisdiction,and the court or governmental entity may order the person to participate in the program asa condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation, or parole.

(3) Whether the participant is capable of wearing the testing device.(4) Whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice per day because of one or more of the following: (a) The participant lives in a rural area and submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome. (b) The participant’s employment requires the participant’s presence at a location remote from the testing location and submitting to testing twice per day would be undulyburdensome.
