To develop within those inmates willing to accept and persevere in such work:\n\na.\n\nPositive attitudes which will enable them to eventually function as law-abiding, self-supporting members of the community;\n\nb.\n\nGood work habits that will assist them in eventually securing and holding gainful employment outside the correctional system; and\n\nc.\n\nTo the extent feasible, marketable skills that can lead directly to gainful employment upon release from a correctional institution. 2. To enable those inmates willing to accept and persevere in such work to:\n\na.\n\nProvide or assist in providing for their dependents, thus tending to strengthen the inmates’ family ties while reducing the likelihood that inmates’ families will have to relyupon public assistance for subsistence;\n\nb.\n\nMake restitution, as the opportunity to do so becomes available, to the victims of the offenses for which the inmates were incarcerated, so as to assist the inmates in acceptingresponsibility for the consequences of their acts;\n\nc.\n\nMake it feasible to require that such inmates pay some portion of the cost of board and maintenance in a correctional institution, in a manner similar to what would be necessary ifthey were employed in the community; and\n\nd.\n\nAccumulate savings so that such inmates will have funds for necessities upon their eventual return to the community.
