Takes possession or control of the property of another, or property in the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof. 2. Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property of another which the person has in the person’s possession or control, whether such possession or control islawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a manner which is inconsistent with ora denial of the trust or of the owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found property,or appropriates such property to the person’s own use, when the owner of such property isknown to the person.\n\na.\n\nFailure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the property within seventy-two hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease or bailment shall beevidence of misappropriation.\n\nb.\n\nIf a time is not specified in the written agreement of lease or bailment for the expiration or termination of the lease or bailment or for the return of the personal property, failure bya lessee or bailee to return the property within five days after proper notice to the lessee orbailee shall be evidence of misappropriation. For the purposes of this paragraph,\n\n“propernotice”\n\nmeans a written notice of the expiration or termination of the lease or bailmentagreement sent to the lessee or bailee by certified or restricted certified mail at the addressof the lessee or bailee specified in the agreement.

Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession, control, or ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial use of property of another, bydeception. Where compensation for goods and services is ordinarily paid immediately uponthe obtaining of such goods or the rendering of such services, the refusal to pay or leavingthe premises without payment or offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner oroperator the right to pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference thatthe goods or services were obtained by deception. 4. Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to have been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been stolen, unless the person’spurpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or to deliver it to an appropriate public officer.The fact that the person is found in possession of property which has been stolen from twoor more persons on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person familiarwith the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which is far below itsreasonable value, or that the person violated section 714.27A in a transaction involving theproperty, shall be evidence from which the court or jury may infer that the person knew orbelieved that the property had been stolen. 5. Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party. 6. Makes, utters, draws, delivers, or gives any check, share draft, draft, or written order on any bank, credit union, person, or corporation, and obtains property, the use of property,including rental property, or service in exchange for such instrument, if the person knowsthat such check, share draft, draft, or written order will not be paid when presented.\n\na.\n\nWhenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because of insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument the amount due thereon withinten days of the maker’s receipt of notice from the holder that payment has been refused by thedrawee, the court or jury may infer from such facts that the maker knew that the instrumentwould not be paid on presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by certified mail, orby personal service in the manner prescribed for serving original notices.\n\nb.\n\nWhenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because the maker has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such fact that the maker knewthat the instrument would not be paid on presentation. 7.
