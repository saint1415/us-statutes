All equipment, supplies, or services procured by the department shall be purchased by a competitive bidding procedure as established by rule. However, the director may exempt by rule purchases of noncompetitive items and purchases in lots or quantities too small to be effectively purchased by competitive bidding. Preference shall be given to purchasing Iowa products and purchases from Iowa-based businesses if the Iowa-based business bids submitted are comparable in price to bids submitted by out-of-state businesses and otherwise meet the required specifications. If the laws of another state mandate a percentage preference for businesses or products from that state and the effect of the preference is that bids of Iowa businesses or products that are otherwise low and responsive are not selected in the other state, the same percentage preference shall be applied to Iowa businesses and products when businesses or products from that other state are bid to supply Iowa requirements.\n\nb. The department and each state agency shall provide notice in an electronic format available to the public of every competitive bidding opportunity offered by the department or the state agency as provided in section 73.2, subsection 2. The department may establish by rule requirements relating to such notice. A competitive bidding opportunity that is not preceded by a notice that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph is void and shall be rebid. A request for proposals for architectural or engineering services may be posted electronically by a department or state agency.\n\n2. Notwithstanding section 72.3, if the competitive bidding procedure used by the department involves the use of a reverse auction or similar competitive bidding procedure requiring the disclosure of bid information submitted by vendors, the department shall disclose the bid information as necessary and appropriate.\n\n3. The director may also exempt the purchase of an item or service from a competitive bidding procedure when the director determines that the best interests of the state will be served by the exemption which shall be based on one of the following:\n\na. An immediate or emergency need existing for the item or service.\n\nb. A need to protect the health, safety, or welfare of persons occupying or visiting a public improvement or property located adjacent to the public improvement.\n\n4. a. The director may contract for the purchase of items or services by the department. Contracts for the purchase of items or services shall be awarded on the basis of the lowest competent bid. Contracts not based on competitive bidding shall be awarded on the basis of bidder competence and reasonable price.\n\nb. Architectural and engineering services shall be procured in a reasonable manner, as the director by rule may determine, on the basis of competence and qualification for the type of services required and for a fair and reasonable price.\n\n5. The director may enter into a cooperative procurement agreement with another governmental entity relating to the procurement of goods or services, whether the goods or services are for the use of the department or other governmental entities. The cooperative procurement agreement shall clearly specify the purpose of the agreement and the method by which that purpose will be accomplished. Any power exercised under the agreement shall not exceed the power granted to any party to the agreement.\n\n6. The director may refuse all bids on any item or service and request new bids.\n\n7. The director shall establish by rule the amount of security, if any, to accompany a bid or as a condition precedent to the awarding of any contract and the circumstances under which a security will be returned to the bidder or forfeited to the state.\n\n8. The director shall adopt rules providing a method for the various state agencies to file with the department a list of those supplies, equipment, machines, and all items needed to properly perform their governmental duties and functions.\n\n9. The director shall furnish a list of specifications, prices, and discounts of contract items to any governmental subdivision which shall be responsible for payment to the vendor under the terms and conditions outlined in the state contract.\n\n10. a. The director shall adopt rules providing that any state agency may, upon request and approval by the department, purchase directly from a vendor if the direct purchasing is more economical than purchasing through the department, if the agency shows that direct purchasing by the state agency would be in the best interests of the state due to an immediate or emergency need, or if the purchase will not exceed an amount, not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, determined by the department by rule and the purchase would contribute to the agency complying with the targeted small business procurement goals under sections 73.15 through 73.21.\n\nb. Any member of the executive council may bring before the executive council for review a decision of the director granting a state agency request for direct purchasing. The executive council shall hear and review the director’s decision in the same manner as an appeal filed by an aggrieved bidder, except that the three-day period for filing for review shall not apply.\n\nc. By January 15 of each year, the department shall submit to the general assembly electronically an annual report of contracts awarded to targeted small businesses, as defined in section 15.102, in the previous fiscal year pursuant to paragraph “a” authorizing direct purchasing by a state agency if the purchase will not exceed an amount determined by the department by rule and would contribute to the agency complying with the targeted small business goals under sections 73.15 through 73.21.\n\n11. a. When the estimated total cost of construction, erection, demolition, alteration, or repair of a public improvement exceeds the competitive bid threshold in section 26.3, or as established in section 314.1B, the department shall comply with chapter 26.\n\nb. In awarding a contract under this subsection, the department shall let the work to the lowest responsible bidder submitting a sealed proposal. However, if the department considers the bids received not to be acceptable, all bids may be rejected and new bids requested. A bid shall be accompanied by a certified or cashier’s check or bid bond in an amount designated in the advertisement for bids as security that the bidder will enter into a contract for the work requested. The department shall establish the bid security in an amount equal to at least five percent, but not more than ten percent of the estimated total cost of the work. The certified or cashier’s checks or bid bonds of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned as soon as the successful bidder is determined. The certified or cashier’s check or bid bond of the successful bidder shall be returned upon execution of the contract. This subsection does not apply to the construction, erection, demolition, alteration, or repair of a public improvement when the contracting procedure for the work requested is otherwise provided for in law.\n\n12. The state and its political subdivisions shall give preference to purchasing Iowa products and purchasing from Iowa-based businesses if the bids submitted are comparable in price to those submitted by other bidders and meet the required specifications.\n\n13. The director shall adopt rules which provide that a department or agency is not required to comply with the requirements of section 904.808 for the purchase of a product if the department or agency can verify that the product is manufactured within the state. However, the rules shall provide that if a department or agency is not required to comply with the requirements of section 904.808, Iowa state industries, as defined in section 904.802, shall be allowed to submit a bid to provide the product to be purchased.\n\n14. The director shall adopt rules which require that each bid received for the purchase of items purchased by the department includes a product content statement which provides the percentage of the content of the item which is reclaimed material.\n\n15. The director shall review and, where necessary, revise specifications used by state agencies to procure products in order to ensure all of the following:\n\na. The procurement of products containing recovered materials, including but not limited to lubricating oils, retread tires, building insulation materials, and recovered materials from waste tires. The specifications shall be revised if they restrict the use of alternative materials, exclude recovered materials, or require performance standards which exclude products containing recovered materials unless the agency seeking the product can document that the use of recovered materials will hamper the intended use of the product.\n\nb. The procurement by state agencies of biobased hydraulic fluids, greases, and other industrial lubricants manufactured from soybeans in accordance with the requirements of section 8A.316.\n\nc. The procurement of designated biobased products in accordance with the requirements of section 8A.317.\n\n16. a. A bidder, to be considered for an award of a state construction contract, shall disclose to the state agency awarding the contract the names of all subcontractors and suppliers who will work on the project being bid within forty-eight hours after the published date and time by which bids must be submitted.\n\nb. A bidder shall not replace a subcontractor or supplier disclosed under paragraph “a” without the approval of the state agency awarding the contract.\n\nc. A bidder, prior to an award or who is awarded a state construction contract, shall disclose all of the following, as applicable:\n\n(1) If a subcontractor or supplier disclosed under paragraph “a” by a bidder is replaced, the reason for replacement and the name of the new subcontractor or supplier.\n\n(2) If the cost of work to be done by a subcontractor or supplier is changed or if the replacement of a subcontractor or supplier results in a change in the cost, the amount of the change in cost.\n\n17. A state agency shall make every effort to purchase those products produced for sale by sheltered workshops, work activity centers, and other special programs funded in whole or in part by public moneys that employ persons with an intellectual disability or other developmental disabilities or mental illness if the products meet the required specifications.\n\n18. A state agency shall make every effort to purchase products produced for sale by employers of persons in supported employment.\n\n19. The department shall not award a contract to a bidder for a construction, reconstruction, demolition, or repair project or improvement with an estimated cost that exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars in which the bid requires the use of inmate labor supplied by the department of corrections, but not employed by private industry pursuant to section 904.809, to perform the project or improvement.\n\n20. Life cycle cost and energy efficiency shall be included in the criteria used by the department, institutions under the control of the state board of regents, the state department of transportation, the department for the blind, and other state agencies in developing standards and specifications for purchasing energy-consuming products. However, for the purchase of passenger vehicles, light, medium-duty, and heavy-duty trucks, passenger and cargo vans, and sport utility vehicles, a purchase contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder based solely on bid price.\n\n21. Preference shall be given to purchasing American-made products and purchases from American-based businesses if the life cycle costs are comparable to those products of foreign businesses and which most adequately fulfill the department’s need.\n\n22. a. The director may authorize the procurement of goods and services in which a contractual limitation of vendor liability is provided for and set forth in the documents initiating the procurement. The director, in consultation with the department of management, shall adopt rules setting forth the circumstances in which such procurement will be permitted and what types of contractual limitations of liability are permitted. Rules adopted by the director shall establish criteria to be considered in making a determination of whether to permit a contractual limitation of vendor liability with regard to any procurement of goods and services. The criteria, at a minimum, shall include all of the following:\n\n(1) Whether authorizing a contractual limitation of vendor liability is necessary to prevent harm to the state from a failure to obtain the goods or services sought, or from obtaining the goods or services at a higher price if the state refuses to allow a contractual limitation of vendor liability.\n\n(2) Whether the contractual limitation of vendor liability is commercially reasonable when taking into account any risk to the state created by the goods or services to be procured and the purpose for which they will be used.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, a contractual limitation of vendor liability shall not include any limitation on the liability of any vendor for intentional torts, criminal acts, or fraudulent conduct.\n\nc. The rules shall provide for the negotiation of a contractual limitation of vendor liability consistent with the requirements of this section and any other requirements of the department as provided in any related documents associated with a procurement of goods and services.\n\n23. a. The state, through the department, shall give a preference to purchasing equipment, supplies, or services from or awarding public improvement contracts pursuant to subsection 11 to an Iowa-based business as provided under paragraph “b”, as appropriate, if the bid submitted is comparable in price to those submitted by other bidders and meets the required specifications. However, before giving the preference, the department shall confirm with the Iowa employer support of the guard and reserve committee that the requirements of paragraph “b” have been met by the Iowa-based business.\n\nb. To receive a preference as provided by this subsection, the Iowa-based business employer shall have adopted policies beyond those otherwise required by law to support employees who are officers or enlisted persons in the national guard and organized reserves of the armed forces of the United States consistent with standards adopted by the Iowa employer support of the guard and reserve committee. To be eligible for such preference, an employer shall submit to the committee a copy of the applicable policies adopted by the employer and shall sign and submit to the committee a statement of support of persons in the employ of the employer who serve in the national guard and the reserves, recognizing the vital role of the national guard and the reserves, and pledging all of the following:\n\n(1) To neither deny employment nor limit or reduce job opportunities because of an employee’s service in the national guard or organized reserves of the armed forces of the United States.\n\n(2) To grant leaves of absence during a period of military duty or training.\n\n(3) To ensure that all employees are aware of the employer’s policies and the requirements of section 29A.43.\n\n2003 Acts, ch 145, §30; 2004 Acts, ch 1101, §5; 2005 Acts, ch 52, §3; 2005 Acts, ch 100, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1017, §16, 42; 2006 Acts, ch 1072, §3; 2007 Acts, ch 115, §6, 18; 2007 Acts, ch 207, §1, 18; 2007 Acts, ch 215, §79; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2008 Acts, ch 1104, §1; 2010 Acts, ch 1031, §72; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §2; 2011 Acts, ch 127, §33, 89; 2012 Acts, ch 1019, §3; 2017 Acts, ch 4, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1164, §25; 2019 Acts, ch 145, §1, 2\n\nReferred to in §8A.311A, 8A.317, 8A.321, 8A.708, 15.106B, 216B.3, 262.9, 307.21, 459.505\n\nPreferences; see also chapter 73, §8A.311B",

If real property acquired by the department in the name of the state is subject to a lease in effect at the time of acquisition, the director may honor and maintain the existing lease subject to the following requirements:\n\n(1) The lease shall not be renewed beyond the term of the existing lease including any renewal periods under the lease that are solely at the discretion of the lessee.\n\n(2) The lease shall not be renewed by the department as the lessor if the lessor has discretion to not renew under the existing lease.\n\n(3) The lease shall not be maintained for a period in excess of ten years from the date of acquisition of the real property, including any renewal periods, without the approval of the executive council.\n\n(4) The lease shall not be maintained if the lessee at the time of the acquisition ceases to occupy the leased property.\n\n10. Subject to the selection procedures of section 12.30, employ financial consultants, banks, insurers, underwriters, accountants, attorneys, and other advisors or consultants necessary to implement the provisions of subsection 7.\n\n11. Prepare annual status reports for all capital projects in progress of the department, and submit the status reports to the legislative services agency and the department of management on or before January 15 of each year.\n\n12. In carrying out the requirements of section 64.6, purchase an individual or a blanket surety bond insuring the fidelity of state officers. The department may self-assume or self-insure fidelity exposures for state officials and employees. A state official is deemed to have furnished surety if the official has been covered by a program of insurance or self-insurance established by the department. To the extent possible, all bonded state employees shall be covered under one or more blanket bonds or position schedule bonds.\n\n13. Review the management of state property loss exposures and state liability risk exposures for the capitol complex. Insurance coverage may include self-insurance or any type of insurance protection sold by insurers, including, but not limited to, full coverage, partial coverage, coinsurance, reinsurance, and deductible insurance coverage.\n\n14. Establish a monument maintenance account in the state treasury under the control of the department.

Funds in the account shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account. Notwithstanding section 12C.7, interest earned on the account shall be deposited in the account and shall be used to maintain the designated monument. Any maintenance funds for a state monument held by the state and interest earned on the funds shall be used to maintain the designated monument. Notwithstanding section 8.33, funds in the monument maintenance account at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund of the state.\n\n15. Prepare an annual report listing any state building, as defined in section 8A.318, that is vacant and submit the annual report to the legislative services agency and the department of management on or before January 15 of each year.\n\n16. At least thirty days prior to entering into a contract for a lease or renewal of a lease pursuant to subsection 6 or a contract for the acquisition of real property pursuant to subsection 9 in which any part or the total amount of the contract is at least fifty thousand dollars, notify the legislative services agency concerning the contract.

The director may assign a motor vehicle either for part-time or full-time use. The director may revoke the assignment at any time.\n\n2. The director may cause all state-assigned motor vehicles to be inspected periodically. Whenever the inspection reveals that repairs have been improperly made on the motor vehicle or that the operator is not giving the motor vehicle the proper care, the director shall report this fact to the head of the state agency to which the motor vehicle has been assigned, together with recommendation for improvement.\n\n3. a. The director shall provide for a record system for the keeping of records of the total number of miles state-assigned motor vehicles are driven and the per-mile cost of operation of each motor vehicle. Every state officer or employee shall keep a record book to be furnished by the director in which the officer or employee shall enter all purchases of gasoline, lubricating oil, grease, and other incidental expense in the operation of the motor vehicle assigned to the officer or employee, giving the quantity and price of each purchase, including the cost and nature of all repairs on the motor vehicle. Each operator of a state-assigned motor vehicle shall promptly prepare a report at the end of each month on forms furnished by the director and forwarded to the director, giving the information the director may request in the report. Each month, the director shall compile the costs and mileage of state-assigned motor vehicles from the reports and keep a cost history for each motor vehicle and the costs shall be reduced to a cost-per-mile basis for each motor vehicle. The director shall call to the attention of an elected official or the head of any state agency to which a motor vehicle has been assigned any evidence of the mishandling or misuse of a state-assigned motor vehicle which is called to the director’s attention.\n\nb. The director shall provide for the purchase and operation of motor vehicles using qualified renewable fuels and for the purchase of qualified renewable fuels used to operate those motor vehicles as provided in section 8A.368.\n\n4. a.

This paragraph does not apply to vehicles purchased for law enforcement purposes or used for off-road maintenance work, or work vehicles used to pull loaded trailers.\n\nc. The director shall assign motor vehicles available for use to maximize the average passenger miles per gallon of motor fuel consumed. In assigning motor vehicles, the director shall consider standards established by the director, which may include but are not limited to the number of passengers traveling to a destination, the fuel economy of and passenger capacity of vehicles available for assignment, and any other relevant information, to assure assignment of the most energy-efficient vehicle or combination of vehicles for a trip from those vehicles available for assignment. The standards shall not apply to special work vehicles and law enforcement vehicles.

All used motor vehicles turned in to the director shall be disposed of by public auction, and the sales shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation one week in advance of sale, and the receipts from the sale shall be deposited in the depreciation fund to the credit of the state agency turning in the vehicle; except that, in the case of a used motor vehicle of special design, the director may, instead of selling it at public auction, authorize the motor vehicle to be traded for another vehicle of similar design. If a vehicle sustains damage and the cost to repair exceeds the wholesale value of the vehicle, the director may dispose of the motor vehicle by obtaining two or more written salvage bids and the vehicle shall be sold to the highest responsible bidder.\n\n6. The director may authorize the establishment of motor pools consisting of a number of state-assigned motor vehicles under the director’s supervision. The director may store the motor vehicles in a public or private garage. If the director establishes a motor pool, any state officer or employee desiring the use of a state-assigned motor vehicle on state business shall notify the director of the need for a vehicle within a reasonable time prior to actual use of the motor vehicle. The director may assign a motor vehicle from the motor pool to the state officer or employee, or from the vendor awarded a contract pursuant to section 8A.367. If two or more state officers or employees desire the use of a state-assigned motor vehicle for a trip to the same destination for the same length of time, the director may assign one vehicle to make the trip.\n\n7. The director shall require that a sign be placed on each state-owned motor vehicle in a conspicuous place which indicates its ownership by the state. This requirement shall not apply to motor vehicles requested to be exempt by the director or by the commissioner of public safety. All state-owned motor vehicles shall display registration plates bearing the word “official” except motor vehicles requested to be furnished with ordinary plates by the director or by the commissioner of public safety pursuant to section 321.19.

If the director determines that state-owned sources for the purchase of fuel are not reasonably accessible, the director shall authorize the purchase of fuel from other sources. The director may prescribe a manner, other than the use of the revolving fund, in which the purchase of fuel from state-owned sources is charged to the state agency responsible for the use of the motor vehicle. The director shall prescribe the manner in which oil and other normal motor vehicle maintenance for state-owned motor vehicles may be purchased from private sources, if they cannot be reasonably obtained from a state motor pool. The director may advertise for bids and award contracts in accordance with competitive bidding procedures for items and services as provided in this subchapter for furnishing fuel, oil, grease, and vehicle replacement parts for all state-owned motor vehicles.

The director shall oversee all activities delegated to that agency.\n\ne. Utilize appropriate persons, including officers and employees in the executive branch, to assist in the recruitment and examination of applicants for employment. These officers and employees are not entitled to extra pay for their services, but shall be paid their necessary traveling and other expenses.\n\nf. (1) Develop, in consultation with the department of veterans affairs, programs to inform state employees who are members of the national guard or organized reserves of the armed forces of the United States, and their families, of their rights and benefits while the member is deployed in federal active duty.\n\n(2) Develop, in consultation with the department of veterans affairs and the department of workforce development, programs to inform members of the national guard or organized reserves of the armed forces of the United States returning to Iowa following federal active duty about job opportunities in state government.\n\n(3) Develop, in consultation with the department of veterans affairs, the department of education, the department of workforce development, the United States department of veterans affairs, and the United States department of labor, the following:\n\n(a) Programs to inform disabled veterans returning to the state after federal active duty about federally funded job training opportunities in state government, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. ch. 31.\n\n(b) State government job training programs for disabled veterans that qualify for federal funding from the United States department of veterans affairs.\n\n(c) A noncompetitive hiring program for disabled veterans who satisfactorily complete a federally funded job training program approved by the United States department of veterans affairs.

(1) (a) Consult with the department of management and discuss and collaborate with executive branch agencies to implement and maintain a policy for incrementally increasing the aggregate ratio in the number of employees per supervisory employee in executive branch agencies. For purposes of determining the effects of the policy on the state employee workforce, the base date of July 1, 2008, shall be used and the target date for full implementation shall be July 1, 2011. The target aggregate ratio of supervisory employees to other employees shall be as follows:\n\n(i) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, one to fourteen.\n\n(ii) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, one to fifteen.\n\n(b) For the purposes of this paragraph “g”, “supervisory employee” means a public employee who is not a member of a collective bargaining unit and who has authority, in the interest of a public employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other public employees, to direct such public employees, or to adjust the grievances of such public employees, or to effectively recommend any such action.\n\n(c) In this paragraph “g”, executive branch agencies, except the department of public safety, shall not grant a supervisory employee the right to replace or bump a junior employee not being laid off for a position for which the supervisory employee is qualified.\n\n(d) The policy shall allow appropriation units with twenty-eight or fewer full-time equivalent employee positions to apply for an exception to the policy through the executive council. The policy shall allow for exceptions when the supervisory employee ratio is mandated by a federal requirement.\n\n(e) (i) Beginning July 1, 2011, the policy shall allow a director of an executive branch agency who believes that the agency will not be able to reach the applicable target aggregate ratio to apply for a waiver of that requirement through a five-person review board. In applying for a waiver, the director shall provide detailed documentation to the board describing the efforts that the executive branch agency has made in attempting to meet the applicable target aggregate ratio provided in this paragraph “g”. The review board shall consist of the director of the department of management or a designee of the director, three agency directors or the designees of those directors as designated by the governor, and one public member selected by the employee organization representing the greatest number of executive branch employees. However, if a department represented on the review board seeks a waiver, the member representing the department shall not participate in the decision on whether to grant a waiver for that department.\n\n(ii) Prior to determining whether to grant a waiver, the review board shall make an initial determination of whether the executive branch agency has provided sufficient information to conduct a review. If not, the review board shall deny the request and notify the executive branch agency of the information needed to consider the request for waiver. If a waiver is granted, the review board shall limit the waiver to only those operations within an executive branch agency in which adequate justification for granting a waiver has been established.\n\n(f) The policy shall provide that if layoffs are implemented, the number of middle management position layoffs shall correspond to the relative number of direct service position layoffs.\n\n(g) The policy shall improve on the system in effect as of the base date by specifically defining and accounting for supervisory employee span of control.\n\n(h) The policy shall provide that in calculating the span of control ratio for an executive branch agency, unfunded full-time equivalent positions shall not be utilized.\n\n(i) The department shall present an interim report to the governor and general assembly on or before April 1, 2010, annual updates on or before April 1 subsequently, and a final report on or before April 1, 2012, detailing the effects of the policy on the composition of the workforce, cost savings, government efficiency, and outcomes.\n\n(j) The policy developed pursuant to this paragraph “g” shall not encompass employees under the state board of regents.\n\n(2) Evaluate the state’s systems for job classification of executive branch employees in order to ensure the existence of technical skill-based career paths for such employees which do not depend upon an employee gaining supervisory responsibility for advancement, and which provide incentives for such employees to broaden their knowledge and skill base. The evaluation shall include but is not limited to a review of the classifications for all positions and providing options for eliminating obsolete, duplicative, or unnecessary job classifications. The department shall present interim reports to the general assembly on or before January 15, 2010, and January 14, 2011, concerning the department’s progress in completing the evaluation and associated outcomes.\n\n3.

      "text": "8A.413 State human resource management — rules.\n\nThe department shall adopt rules for the administration of this subchapter pursuant to chapter 17A. Rulemaking shall be carried out with due regard to the terms of collective bargaining agreements. A rule shall not supersede a provision of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under chapter 20. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, a rule or regulation shall not be adopted by the department which would deprive the state of Iowa, or any of its agencies or institutions, of federal grants or other forms of financial assistance. The rules shall provide:\n\n1. For the preparation, maintenance, and revision of a job classification plan that encompasses each job in the executive branch, excluding job classifications under the state board of regents, based upon assigned duties and responsibilities, so that the same general qualifications may reasonably be required for and the same pay plan may be equitably applied to all jobs in the same job classification. The director shall classify the position of every employee in the executive branch, excluding employees of the state board of regents, into one of the classes in the plan. An appointing authority or employee adversely affected by a classification or reclassification decision may file an appeal with the director. Appeals of a classification or reclassification decision shall be exempt from the provisions of section 17A.11 and shall be heard by a committee appointed by the director. The classification or reclassification of a position that would cause the expenditure of additional salary funds shall not become effective if the expenditure of funds would be in excess of the total amount budgeted for the department of the appointing authority until budgetary approval has been obtained from the director of the department of management.\n\n2. For notification of the governor when the public interest requires a decrease or increase of employees in any position or type of employment not otherwise provided by law, or the creation or abolishment of any position or type of employment, as determined by the director, acting in good faith. Thereafter, the position or type of employment shall stand abolished or created and the number of employees therein reduced or increased.\n\n3. For pay plans covering all employees in the executive branch, excluding employees of the state board of regents, after consultation with the governor and appointing authorities, and consistent with the terms of collective bargaining agreements negotiated under chapter 20.\n\n4. For examinations to determine the relative fitness of applicants for employment.\n\na. Such examinations shall be practical in character and shall relate to such matters as will fairly assess the ability of the applicant to discharge the duties of the position to which appointment is sought.\n\nb. Where the Code of Iowa establishes certification, registration, or licensing provisions, such documents shall be considered prima facie evidence of basic skills accomplishment and such persons shall be exempt from further basic skills examination.\n\n5. For the public announcement of vacancies at least ten days in advance of the date fixed for the filing of applications for the vacancies, and the advertisement of the vacancies through the communications media. The director may, however, in the director’s discretion, continue to receive applications and examine candidates for a period adequate to assure a sufficient number of eligibles to meet the needs of the system, and may add the names of successful candidates to existing eligible lists.\n\n6. For an applicant for employment in the executive branch to disclose in the application for employment whether the applicant has filed a registration statement pursuant to the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, 22 U.S.C. §611 et seq.\n\n7. For promotions which shall give appropriate consideration to the applicant’s qualifications, record of performance, and conduct. A promotion means a change in the status of an employee from a position in one class to a position in another class having a higher pay grade.\n\n8. For the establishment of lists for appointment and promotion, upon which lists shall be placed the names of successful candidates.\n\n9. For the rejection of applicants who fail to meet reasonable requirements.\n\n10. For the appointment by the appointing authority of a person on the appropriate list to fill a vacancy.\n\n11. For a probation period of six months, excluding educational or training leave, before appointment may be made complete, and during which period a probationer may be discharged or reduced in class or pay. If the employee’s services are unsatisfactory, the employee shall be dropped from the payroll on or before the expiration of the probation period. If satisfactory, the appointment shall be deemed permanent. The determination of the appointing authority shall be final and conclusive.\n\n12. For temporary employment for not more than seven hundred eighty hours in a fiscal year.\n\n13. For provisional employment when there is no appropriate list available. Such provisional employment shall not continue longer than one hundred eighty calendar days.\n\n14. For transfer from a position in one state agency to a similar position in the same state agency or another state agency involving similar qualifications, duties, responsibilities, and salary ranges. Whenever an employee transfers or is transferred from one state agency to another state agency, the employee’s seniority rights, any accumulated sick leave, and accumulated vacation time, as provided in the law, shall be transferred to the new place of employment and credited to the employee. Employees who are subject to contracts negotiated under chapter 20 which include transfer provisions shall be governed by the contract provisions.\n\n15. For reinstatement of persons who have attained permanent status and who resign in good standing or who are laid off from their positions without fault or delinquency on their part.\n\n16. For establishing in cooperation with the appointing authorities a performance management system for all employees in the executive branch, excluding employees of the state board of regents, which shall be considered in determining salary increases; as a factor in promotions; as a factor in determining the order of layoffs and in reinstatement; as a factor in demotions, discharges, and transfers; and for the regular evaluation, at least annually, of the qualifications and performance of those employees.\n\n17. For layoffs by reason of lack of funds or work, or reorganization, and for the recall of employees so laid off, giving consideration in layoffs to the employee’s performance record and length of service. An employee who has been laid off may be on a recall list for one year, which list shall be exhausted by the organizational unit enforcing the layoff before selection of an employee may be made from the promotional or nonpromotional list in the employee’s classification. Employees who are subject to contracts negotiated under chapter 20 which include layoff and recall provisions shall be governed by the contract provisions.\n\n18. For imposition, as a disciplinary measure, of a suspension from service without pay.\n\n19. a. For discharge, suspension, or reduction in job classification or pay grade for any of the following causes:\n\n(1) Failure to perform assigned duties.\n\n(2) Inadequacy in performing assigned duties.\n\n(3) Negligence.\n\n(4) Inefficiency.\n\n(5) Incompetence.\n\n(6) Insubordination.\n\n(7) Unrehabilitated alcoholism or narcotics addiction.\n\n(8) Dishonesty.\n\n(9) Unlawful discrimination.\n\n(10) Failure to maintain a license, certificate, or qualification necessary for a job classification or position.\n\n(11) Any act or conduct which adversely affects the employee’s performance or the employing agency.\n\n(12) Any other good cause for discharge, suspension, or reduction.\n\nb. The person discharged, suspended, or reduced shall be given a written statement of the reasons for the discharge, suspension, or reduction within twenty-four hours after the discharge, suspension, or reduction.\n\nc. All persons concerned with the administration of this subchapter shall use their best efforts to ensure that this subchapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this subchapter shall not be a means of protecting or retaining unqualified or unsatisfactory employees, and shall discharge, suspend, or reduce in job classification or pay grade all employees who should be discharged, suspended, or reduced for any of the causes stated in this subsection.\n\n20. For establishment of a uniform plan for resolving employee grievances and complaints. Employees who are subject to contracts negotiated under chapter 20 which include grievance and complaint provisions shall be governed by the contract provisions.\n\n21. For attendance regulations, and special leaves of absence, with or without pay, or reduced pay, in the various classes of positions in the executive branch, excluding positions under the state board of regents.\n\na. Employees who are subject to contracts negotiated under chapter 20 which include leave of absence provisions shall be governed by the contract provisions.\n\nb. Annual sick leave and vacation time shall be granted in accordance with section 70A.1.\n\n22. For the development and operation of programs to improve the work effectiveness and morale of employees in the executive branch, excluding employees of the state board of regents, including training, safety, health, welfare, counseling, recreation, and employee relations.\n\n23. For veterans preference through a provision that veterans, as defined in section 35.1, shall have five points added to the grade or score attained in qualifying examinations for appointment to jobs.\n\na. Veterans who have a service-connected disability or are receiving compensation, disability benefits, or pension under laws administered by the United States department of veterans affairs shall have ten points added to the grades attained in qualifying examinations.\n\nb. A veteran who has been awarded the purple heart for disabilities incurred in action shall be considered to have a service-connected disability.\n\n24. For acceptance of the qualifications, requirements, regulations, and general provisions established under other sections of the Code pertaining to professional registration, certification, and licensing.\n\n25.
