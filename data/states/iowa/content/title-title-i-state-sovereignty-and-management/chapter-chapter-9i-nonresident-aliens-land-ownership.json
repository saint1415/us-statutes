Commercial sales are incidental to the research or experimental purposes of the corporation when such sales are less than twenty-five percent of the gross sales of the primary product of the research.\n\n(2) The agricultural land is used for the primary purpose of testing, developing, or producing seeds or plants for sale or resale to farmers as seed stock. Grain which is not sold as seed stock is an incidental sale and must be less than twenty-five percent of the gross sales of the primary product of the research and experimental activities.\n\n(3) Until July 1, 2001, the agricultural land is used for the primary purpose of testing, developing, or producing animals for sale or resale to farmers as breeding stock. However, after July 1, 1989, to qualify under this paragraph, the following conditions must be satisfied:\n\n(a) The nonresident alien, foreign business, or foreign government or an agent, trustee, or fiduciary of the alien, business, or government must not hold the agricultural land other than as a lessee.

The secretary of state shall notify the lessee of receipt of the copy of the lease.\n\n(4) Culls and test animals may be sold under subparagraph (3). For a three-year period beginning on the date that the lease takes effect, the gross sales for any year shall not be greater than five hundred thousand dollars. After the three-year period ends, the gross sales for any year shall not be greater than twenty-five percent of the gross sales for that year of the breeding stock, or five hundred thousand dollars, whichever is less.
