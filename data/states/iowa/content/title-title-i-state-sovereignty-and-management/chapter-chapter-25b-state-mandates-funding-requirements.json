      "text": "25B.2 Findings and purpose — effect of unfunded state mandate.\n\n1. The general assembly finds that preceding actions of state government in specifying the manner, standards, and conditions under which public services are rendered to citizens by the political subdivisions of this state in some cases have not resulted in equitable relationships between the state government and its political subdivisions. Some state actions have dealt in detail with the internal management of the political subdivisions; some have specified the establishment of new services and facilities without providing new revenue sources or financial participation by the state to meet the additional costs; and other actions have specified the adoption of higher service standards without a complete assessment of the impact on the expenditures and tax rates of the political subdivisions.\n\n2. It is the purpose of this chapter to enunciate policies, criteria, and procedures to govern future state-initiated specification of local government services, standards, employment conditions, and retirement benefits that necessitates increased expenditures by political subdivisions or agencies and entities which contract with a political subdivision to provide services.\n\n3. a. If, on or after July 1, 1994, a state mandate is enacted by the general assembly, or otherwise imposed, on a political subdivision and the state mandate requires a political subdivision to engage in any new activity, to provide any new service, or to provide any service beyond that required by any law enacted prior to July 1, 1994, and the state does not appropriate moneys to fully fund the cost of the state mandate, the political subdivision is not required to perform the activity or provide the service and the political subdivision shall not be subject to the imposition of any fines or penalties for the failure to comply with the state mandate unless the legislation specifies the amount or proportion of the cost of the state mandate which the state shall pay annually. However, this subsection does not apply to any requirement imposed on a political subdivision relating to public employee retirement systems under chapters 97B, 410, and 411.\n\nb. For the purposes of this subsection, any requirement originating from the federal government and administered, implemented, or enacted by the state, or any allocation of federal moneys conditioned upon enactment of a state law or rule, is not a state mandate.\n\nc. For the purposes of this subsection, “political subdivision” includes community colleges and area education agencies.\n\n83 Acts, ch 142, §2; 94 Acts, ch 1173, §2; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201",

If a bill or joint resolution containing a state mandate is enacted, unless the estimate already on file with the house of origin is sufficient, the legislative services agency shall prepare a final estimate of additional local revenue expenditures required by the state mandate and file the estimate with the secretary of state for inclusion with the official copy of the bill or resolution to which it applies.

The fiscal impact statement shall be submitted to the administrative rules coordinator for publication in the Iowa administrative bulletin along with the notice of intended action.\n\n2. The fiscal impact statement shall also be submitted to the legislative fiscal committee of the legislative council. Beginning in the first full fiscal year after adoption of the state administrative rule, the fiscal committee shall annually prepare a report for each fiscal impact statement submitted detailing the fiscal impact of the administrative rule on the affected political subdivision, or agencies and entities which contract with the political subdivision to provide services.
