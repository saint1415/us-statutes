It shall be unlawful for any public employer to authorize, consent to, or condone a strike; or to pay or agree to pay any public employee for any day in which the employee participates in a strike; or to pay or agree to pay any increase in compensation or benefits to any public employee in response to or as a result of any strike or any act which violates subsection 1. It shall be unlawful for any official, director, or representative of any public employer to authorize, ratify, or participate in any violation of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent new or renewed bargaining and agreement within the scope of negotiations as defined by this chapter, at any time after such violation of subsection 1 has ceased; but it shall be unlawful for any public employer or employee organization to bargain at any time regarding suspension or modification of any penalty provided in this section or regarding any request by the public employer to a court for such suspension or modification.\n\n3. In the event of any violation or imminently threatened violation of subsection 1 or 2, any citizen domiciled within the jurisdictional boundaries of the public employer may petition the district court for the county in which the violation occurs or the district court for Polk county for an injunction restraining such violation or imminently threatened violation.\n\nRules of civil procedure 1.1501 to 1.1511\n\nregarding injunctions shall apply. However, the court shall grant a temporary injunction if it appears to the court that a violation has occurred or is imminently threatened; the plaintiff need not show that the violation or threatened violation would greatly or irreparably injure the plaintiff; and no bond shall be required of the plaintiff unless the court determines that a bond is necessary in the public interest. Failure to comply with any temporary or permanent injunction granted pursuant to this section shall constitute a contempt punishable pursuant to chapter 665. The punishment shall not exceed five hundred dollars for an individual, or ten thousand dollars for an employee organization or public employer, for each day during which the failure to comply continues, or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months, or both such fine and imprisonment. An individual or an employee organization which makes an active good faith effort to comply fully with the injunction shall not be deemed to be in contempt.\n\n4. If a public employee is held to be in contempt of court for failure to comply with an injunction pursuant to this section, or is convicted of violating this section, the employee shall be ineligible for any employment by the same public employer for a period of twelve months. The employee’s public employer shall immediately discharge the employee, but upon the employee’s request the court shall stay the discharge to permit further judicial proceedings.\n\n5. If an employee organization or any of its officers is held to be in contempt of court for failure to comply with an injunction pursuant to this section, or is convicted of violating this section, the employee organization shall be immediately decertified, shall cease to represent the bargaining unit, and may again be certified only after twenty-four months have elapsed from the effective date of decertification and only if a new petition for certification pursuant to section 20.14 is filed and a new certification election pursuant to section 20.15 is held. The penalties provided in this section may be suspended or modified by the court, but only upon request of the public employer and only if the court determines the suspension or modification is in the public interest.\n\n6.

The employee organization and the public employer may designate any individual as its representative to engage in collective bargaining negotiations.\n\n3. Negotiating sessions, strategy meetings of public employers, mediation, and the deliberative process of arbitrators shall be exempt from the provisions of chapter 21. However, the employee organization shall present its initial bargaining position to the public employer at the first bargaining session. The public employer shall present its initial bargaining position to the employee organization at the second bargaining session, which shall be held no later than two weeks following the first bargaining session.

A collective bargaining agreement or arbitrator’s award shall not be valid or enforceable if its implementation would be inconsistent with any statutory limitation on the public employer’s funds, spending, or budget or would substantially impair or limit the performance of any statutory duty by the public employer. A collective bargaining agreement or arbitrator’s award may provide for benefits conditional upon specified funds to be obtained by the public employer, but the agreement shall provide either for automatic reduction of such conditional benefits or for additional bargaining if the funds are not obtained or if a lesser amount is obtained.\n\n7.

On or after the beginning of the term of office of the governor in that year as prescribed in the Constitution of the State of Iowa, the governor shall have the authority to reject such a proposed statewide collective bargaining agreement. If the governor does so, the parties shall commence collective bargaining in accordance with section 20.17.

The board shall provide, by rule, a date on which any impasse item must be submitted to binding arbitration and for such other procedures as deemed necessary to provide for the completion of negotiations of proposed state collective bargaining agreements not later than March 15.

To the extent adequate, applicable data is available, the arbitrator shall also compare base wages, hours, and conditions of employment of the involved public employees with those of private sector employees doing comparable work, giving consideration to factors peculiar to the area and the classifications involved.\n\n(2) The interests and welfare of the public.\n\n(3) The financial ability of the employer to meet the cost of an offer in light of the current economic conditions of the public employer.

Except as required for purposes of the consideration of the factors specified in subsection 7, paragraphs “a” through “c”, and subsection 8, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) through (3), the parties shall not introduce, and the arbitrator shall not accept or consider, any direct or indirect evidence regarding any subject excluded from negotiations pursuant to section 20.9.\n\n10. a.

Such percentage shall be the change in the consumer price index for the twelve-month period beginning eighteen months prior to the month in which the impasse item regarding base wages was submitted to the arbitrator and ending six months prior to the month in which the impasse item regarding base wages was submitted to the arbitrator.\n\n(2) To assist the parties in the preparation of their final offers on an impasse item regarding base wages, the board shall provide information to the parties regarding the change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for the midwest region for any twelve-month period. The department of workforce development shall assist the board in preparing such information upon request.\n\n11. The selections by the arbitrator and items agreed upon by the public employer and the employee organization, shall be deemed to be the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.\n\n12.

The arbitrator shall give written explanation for the arbitrator’s selections and inform the parties of the decision.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §20.22]\n\n2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2010 Acts, ch 1165, §24 – 29; 2017 Acts, ch 2, §12, 13, 26, 27\n\nReferred to in §20.17, 20.19",
