Where state active duty, national guard duty, federal active duty, or civil air patrol duty is for a period of less than thirty days, a leave of absence under this section shall only be required for those days that the civil employee would normally perform services for the state, subdivision of the state, or a municipality. The provisions of this section shall also apply to a leave of absence by a member of the national disaster medical system of the United States when activated for federal service with the system. If the workday for a civil employee encompasses a continuous period of up to twenty-four consecutive hours, regardless of whether the workday extends into one or two calendar days, the civil employee shall only be required to take a leave of absence for one day for that workday if a leave of absence is required under this paragraph.\n\n2. A state agency, subdivision of the state, or municipality may hire a temporary employee to fill any vacancy created by such leave of absence. Temporary employees hired to fill a vacancy created by a leave of absence under this section shall not count against the number of full-time equivalent positions authorized for the state agency, subdivision of the state, or municipality.\n\n3.
