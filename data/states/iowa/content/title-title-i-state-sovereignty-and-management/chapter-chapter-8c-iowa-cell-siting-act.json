If the project necessitating the modification, relocation, or reconstruction of the small wireless facility or new utility pole is for a private commercial purpose, the authority may require the owner or successor to modify, relocate, or reconstruct the small wireless facility or new utility pole upon prepayment of the costs of such work by the private commercial entity whose project facilitates the need for such work. For purposes of this subparagraph, “new utility pole” means a new utility pole installed by a wireless service provider pursuant to this section solely for use as a wireless support structure and that is owned by the wireless service provider.\n\nc. Beginning with applications filed on or after September 1, 2017, an authority shall accept an application for, process, and issue a permit under this subsection as follows:\n\n(1) An applicant shall not be required to provide more information or pay a higher application fee, consulting fee, or other fee associated with the processing or issuance of a permit than the amount charged to a telecommunications service provider that is not a wireless service provider. The total amount of fees for processing or issuing a permit, including any fees charged by third parties, shall not exceed five hundred dollars for an application addressing no more than five small wireless facilities, and an additional fifty dollars for each small wireless facility addressed in an application in excess of five small wireless facilities. An applicant shall not be required to pay any additional fees or perform any services relating to the acceptance, processing, or issuance of a permit, nor provide any services unrelated to the siting of the small wireless facility or of a new, replacement, or modified utility pole on which a small wireless facility is sited. For purposes of this subparagraph, engineering and structural review are deemed to be related to the permitting of a small wireless facility. The total amount of fees shall be adjusted every five years to reflect any increases or decreases in the consumer price index, rounded to the nearest five dollars.\n\n(2) An authority shall approve or deny a permit application within ninety days following the submission of a completed application. Except as provided herein, an application shall be deemed approved if the authority fails to approve or deny the application within ninety days following the submission of a completed application. This period of time for the processing of an application may be extended upon mutual written agreement between the authority and the applicant. An applicant may address up to twenty-five small wireless facilities in a single application, provided, however, that a single application may only address small wireless facilities within a single two-mile radius consisting of substantially similar equipment to be placed on substantially similar types of wireless support structures or utility poles. In rendering a decision on an application addressing more than one small wireless facility, an authority may approve the application as to certain individual small wireless facilities while denying it as to others. An authority’s denial of an individual small wireless facility or subset of small wireless facilities within an application is not a basis to deny the application as a whole. If an authority receives applications for the approval of more than seventy-five small wireless facilities within a single seven-day period, whether from a single applicant or from multiple applicants, the authority may notify an applicant submitting any additional siting applications during that seven-day period that the authority is invoking its right to an automatic thirty-day extension for any additional siting application submitted during that seven-day period.\n\n(3) (a) An authority may only deny a completed application if any of the following apply:\n\n(i) The application fails to include reasonable information required by the authority and in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(ii) The application does not comply with the Iowa electrical safety code, the national electrical safety code, applicable fire safety codes, or any building code or similar code of general applicability for the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare that was adopted by an authority prior to the filing of the application.\n\n(iii) The application would result in the authority being noncompliant with the federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\n(iv) (A) A licensed engineer selected by the applicant or the authority certifies that siting the small wireless facility as proposed would compromise the structural safety of, or preclude the essential purpose of, the utility pole or wireless support structure in the public right-of-way on which it is proposed to be sited and any of the following conditions apply:\n\n(I) The applicant fails to redesign the small wireless facility in a manner determined necessary by the engineer to make the existing utility pole or wireless support structure structurally sound for the siting of the small wireless facility.\n\n(II) The applicant fails to modify the utility pole or wireless support structure to make the structure structurally sound for the siting of the small wireless facility.\n\n(III) The applicant fails to replace the utility pole or wireless support structure with a utility pole or wireless support structure that is structurally sound for the siting of the small wireless facility.\n\n(IV) The applicant fails to propose an alternative location for the siting of the small wireless facility.\n\n(B) If an applicant chooses to modify or replace a utility pole or wireless support structure to make the structure structurally sound for the siting of a small wireless facility, the applicant shall pay or advance to the authority the costs of modifying or replacing the utility pole or wireless support structure with a utility pole or wireless support structure that would safely support the small wireless facility and preserve the essential purpose of the utility pole or wireless support structure.\n\n(v) The application seeks approval of a new small wireless facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure that would impair, interfere with, or preclude the safe and effective use of facilities already located in the public right-of-way for pedestrian, vehicular, utility, or other authority public right-of-way purposes.\n\n(vi) The application seeks approval for the siting of a small wireless facility outside the public right-of-way that would impair, interfere with, or preclude the safe and effective use of an authority structure or property for a public purpose.\n\n(vii) The application seeks approval for the siting of a small wireless facility on a wireless support structure used exclusively for emergency communications equipment.\n\n(viii) The application seeks approval for the siting of a small wireless facility on a utility pole that is the vertical portion of a support structure for a traffic control signal or device, and the authority determines that the utility pole lacks sufficient space or load capacity for the proposed siting or the small wireless facility cannot be sited on the utility pole without impairing the public health, safety, or welfare.\n\n(b) An authority denying an application shall document the basis for the denial, including the specific code provisions or standards on which the denial is based, and provide the applicant with such documentation on or before the date the application is denied.\n\n(c) An applicant whose application is denied shall have an opportunity to cure any deficiencies identified by the authority as the basis for the denial and to submit a revised application within thirty days following the date of denial without paying an additional fee. The authority shall approve or deny a revised application within thirty days following submission. The authority shall not identify any deficiencies in a second or subsequent denial that were not identified in the original denial.\n\n(4) An authority shall not limit the duration of a permit issued for the siting of a small wireless facility in a public right-of-way pursuant to this subsection, and shall not limit the duration of a permit issued for the siting of a small wireless facility on an authority structure located outside of a public right-of-way to any period less than ten years, with one automatic five-year renewal, provided, however, that the owner of the small wireless facility may terminate the permit upon providing ninety days’ notice to the authority. The construction of a small wireless facility permitted pursuant to this subsection shall commence no later than two years following the date that the permit is issued, or two years after any appeals are exhausted.\n\n(5) An authority shall not impose a moratorium on the processing or issuance of permits under this subsection.\n\n(6) An authority shall process and issue permits on a nondiscriminatory basis. An authority shall receive an application for, process, and issue a permit for the siting of a small wireless facility in a manner substantially comparable to the permitting of other applicants within the jurisdiction of the authority, and may not impose discriminatory licensing standards for persons siting small wireless facilities.\n\n4. The annual recurring rate charged by an authority for the siting of a small wireless facility on an authority utility pole shall not exceed the rate computed by the federal communications commission for telecommunications pole attachments in\n\n47 C.F.R. §1.1409(e)(2)\n\n5. a. An authority shall authorize the siting of a small wireless facility on an authority structure located outside of a public right-of-way to the same extent the authority authorizes access to such structures for other non-authority communications equipment that involve external attachments, and may authorize the siting even if the authority has not previously permitted such access.\n\nb. A siting authorized under this subsection shall be subject to reasonable rates, terms, and conditions as provided in one or more agreements between the authority and the wireless service provider. Notwithstanding chapter 480A, the annual recurring rate for such siting as charged by an authority shall not exceed the lesser of the following:\n\n(1) The amount charged for a similar commercial project or use to occupy a similar area of space on similarly situated property.\n\n(2) The projected cost to the authority resulting from the siting.\n\n6. A party aggrieved by the final action of an authority, either by its affirmative action on a permit, term or condition, or rate under the provisions of this section or by its inaction, may bring an action for review in any court of competent jurisdiction, except that if the final action of the authority was the denial of a conditional or special use permit pursuant to this section, the party must first seek review under section 335.13 or 414.10, as applicable.\n\n7. This section only addresses an authority’s approval of zoning and building permits and the rates for the use of public rights-of-way and authority structures. This section shall not modify the rights and obligations of a nonauthority owner of a utility pole or a municipal utility that owns a utility pole, under\n\n47 C.F.R. §1.1401 et seq.\n\n, and the Iowa electrical safety code.\n\n2017 Acts, ch 112, §3; 2017 Acts, ch 170, §22; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §6; 2023 Acts, ch 64, §4\n\nReferred to in §8C.7C\n\nSubsection 3, paragraph c, subparagraph (3), subparagraph division (a), subparagraph subdivision (iii) amended",

      "text": "8C.7B Small wireless facilities — violation and removal.\n\n1. A public utility that owns or controls a utility pole on which a small wireless facility is sited in alleged violation of this chapter or the Iowa electrical safety code shall notify the owner of the small wireless facility of the alleged violation, in writing or by any other method agreed upon by the parties in writing. The notice shall include the following information:\n\na. The address and location where the alleged violation occurred.\n\nb. A description of the alleged violation.\n\nc. Suggested corrective action.\n\n2. Upon the receipt of notice of an alleged violation, the recipient of such notice shall respond to the public utility within sixty days in writing or by any other method agreed upon by the parties in writing. The response shall include the following information:\n\na. A statement disclosing whether or not the recipient of the notice is the owner of the small wireless facility at issue.\n\nb. A statement disclosing that the owner disputes that the alleged violation has occurred, if applicable.\n\nc. A plan for corrective action if the owner does not dispute that the violation has occurred.\n\nd. A statement disclosing whether the violation has been corrected, if the owner does not dispute that the violation has occurred.\n\n3. The owner of a small wireless facility in alleged violation of this chapter or the Iowa electrical safety code shall correct the alleged violation within one hundred eighty days after receiving notice of the violation unless, for good cause shown, a delay for taking corrective action is appropriate or if the parties otherwise agree in writing to extend the time required to take corrective action. Good cause for a delay in corrective action shall include but is not limited to a dispute over whether the recipient of the notice is the owner of the small wireless facility at issue, a dispute over whether the alleged violation has occurred, or if taking corrective action within the required time frame is not possible due to circumstances which are beyond the control of the owner of the small wireless facility. The public utility and owner of the small wireless facility shall cooperate in determining an efficient and cost-effective solution to correct an alleged violation.\n\n4. a. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 3, in the event of an emergency, an authority or public utility shall contact the owner of the small wireless facility at issue and provide the owner with a reasonable opportunity, given the nature of the emergency, to alleviate such emergency or participate with the authority or public utility to make any repairs necessary to alleviate such emergency. If the owner of the small wireless facility does not respond in a timely manner, as determined by the authority or public utility given the nature of the emergency, the authority or public utility may remove or make alterations to the small wireless facility as necessary to ensure public safety.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, “emergency” means exigent and extraordinary circumstances under which the physical or electrical failure of a utility pole, wireless support structure, or small wireless facility threatens imminent physical harm to persons or there is a substantial likelihood of imminent and significant harm to property.\n\n5. If the parties cannot resolve a dispute after following the procedures provided in this section, any party may file an action concerning an alleged violation under this section in the district court for the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, for any appropriate remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility deemed by the court to be in violation of this chapter or the Iowa electrical safety code. However, this section shall not preclude a party from bringing an action pursuant to the Iowa electrical safety code or\n\n47 C.F.R. §1.1401 et seq.\n\n, or the application of a dispute resolution process set forth in an applicable pole attachment agreement between the parties.\n\n6. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the ability of a public utility and the owner of a small wireless facility to voluntarily enter into a pole attachment agreement that establishes different terms for the siting of a small wireless facility or the resolution of a dispute regarding such a facility.\n\n2017 Acts, ch 112, §4",
