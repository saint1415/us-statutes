The committee shall require that a financial institution seeking to qualify for the list shall annually provide the committee a written statement that the financial institution has complied with the requirements of this chapter and has a commitment to community reinvestment consistent with the safe and sound operation of a financial institution, unless the financial institution has received a rating of satisfactory or higher pursuant to the federal Community Reinvestment Act, 12 U.S.C. §2901 et seq., and such rating is certified to the committee by the superintendent of banking. To qualify for the list, a financial institution must demonstrate a continuing commitment to meet the credit needs of the local community in which it is chartered.\n\n3. The committee may require a financial institution to provide public notice inviting the public to submit comments to the financial institution regarding its community lending activities.

Ability to meet various community credit needs based on financial condition, size, legal impediments, and local economic conditions.\n\n5. a. A person who believes a bank has failed to meet its community reinvestment responsibility may file a complaint with the committee detailing the basis for that belief.\n\nb. If any committee member, in the member’s discretion, finds that the complaint has merit, the member may order the bank alleged to have failed to meet its community reinvestment responsibility to attend and participate in a meeting with the complainant. The committee member may specify who, at minimum, shall represent the bank at the meeting. At the meeting, or at any other time, the bank may, but is not required to, enter into an agreement with a complainant to correct alleged failings.\n\nc. A majority of the committee may order a bank against which a complaint has been filed pursuant to this subsection, to disclose such additional information relating to community reinvestment as required by the order of the majority of the committee.\n\nd. This subsection does not preempt any other remedies available under statutory or common law available to the committee, the superintendent of banking, or aggrieved persons to cure violations of this section or chapter 524, or rules adopted pursuant to this section or chapter 524.

The loss to public depositors shall be satisfied, first through any applicable deposit insurance and then through the sale of securities pledged by the defaulting credit union, and then the assets of the defaulting credit union. The priority of claims are those established pursuant to section 533.404, subsection 1, paragraph “b”. To the extent permitted by federal law, in the distribution of an insolvent federally chartered credit union’s assets, the order of payment of liabilities if its assets are insufficient to pay in full all its liabilities for which claims are made shall be in the same order as for the equivalent type of state chartered credit union as provided in section 533.404, subsection 1, paragraph “b”.\n\nc. The claim of a public depositor for purposes of this section shall be the amount of the depositor’s deposits plus interest to the date the funds are distributed to the public depositor at the rate the credit union agreed to pay on the funds reduced by the portion of the funds which is insured by federal deposit insurance.\n\nd. If the loss to public funds is not covered by insurance and the proceeds of the failed credit union’s assets which are liquidated within thirty days of the closing of the credit union and pledged collateral, the treasurer shall provide coverage of the remaining loss from the state sinking fund for public deposits in credit unions. If the funds are inadequate to cover the entire loss, then the treasurer shall make an assessment against other credit unions who hold public funds. The assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of the remaining loss to public depositors by a percentage that represents the average of public funds deposits held by all credit unions during the preceding twelve-month period ending on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month the credit union was closed. Each credit union shall pay its assessment to the treasurer within three business days after it receives notice of assessment. If a credit union fails to pay its assessment when due, the treasurer of state shall initiate a lawsuit to collect the assessment. If a credit union is found to have failed to pay the assessment as required by this paragraph, the court shall order it to pay the assessment, court costs, reasonable attorney’s fees based upon the amount of time the attorney general’s office spent preparing and bringing the action, and reasonable expenses incurred by the treasurer of state’s office. Idle balances in the fund are to be invested by the treasurer with earnings credited to the fund. Fees paid by credit unions for administration of this chapter will be credited to the fund and the treasurer may deduct actual costs of administration from the fund.\n\ne. Any amount realized from the sale of collateral pursuant to paragraph “d”, in excess of the amount of a credit union’s assessment, shall continue to be held by the treasurer, in the same interest-bearing investments available for public funds, as collateral until that credit union provides substitute collateral or is otherwise entitled to its release.\n\n85 Acts, ch 194, §6\n\nCS85, §453.23\n\n92 Acts, ch 1156, §37 – 40\n\nC93, §12C.23\n\n94 Acts, ch 1023, §3; 99 Acts, ch 117, §11, 15; 99 Acts, ch 208, §43, 74; 2007 Acts, ch 174, §81; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201\n\nReferred to in §12C.1, 12C.25",

      "text": "12C.23A Payment of losses in a bank.\n\n1. The acceptance of public funds by a bank pursuant to this chapter constitutes all of the following:\n\na. Agreement by the bank to pledge collateral as required by section 12C.22.\n\nb. Consent by the bank to the disposition of the collateral in accordance with this section.\n\nc. Consent by the bank to assessments by the treasurer of state in accordance with this chapter.\n\nd. Agreement by the bank to provide accurate information and to otherwise comply with the requirements of this chapter.\n\ne. Consent to the jurisdiction and authority of the superintendent as provided under section 12C.29.\n\n2. A bank is liable for payment if the bank fails to pay a check, draft, or warrant drawn by a public funds depositor or to account for a check, draft, warrant, order, or certificate of deposit, or any public funds entrusted to the bank if, in failing to pay, the bank acts contrary to the terms of an agreement between the bank and the public funds depositor. The bank is also liable to the treasurer of state for payment if the bank fails to pay an assessment by the treasurer of state under subsection 3 when the assessment is due.\n\n3. If a bank is closed by its primary state or federal regulator, including a bank that has accepted public funds deposits under section 12B.10, subsection 7, each public funds depositor with deposits in the bank shall notify the treasurer of state of the amount of any claim within thirty days of the closing. The treasurer of state shall implement the following procedures:\n\na. In cooperation with the responsible regulatory officials for the closed bank, the treasurer shall validate the amount of public funds on deposit at the closed bank and the amount of deposit insurance applicable to the deposits.\n\nb. Any loss to a public funds depositor shall be satisfied first by any federal deposit insurance, then by the sale or other disposition of collateral pledged by the closed bank, then from the assets of the closed bank. To the extent permitted by federal law, the priority of claims are those established pursuant to section 524.1312, subsection 2. To the extent permitted by federal law, in the distribution of an insolvent federally chartered bank’s assets, the order of payment of liabilities, if its assets are insufficient to pay in full all its liabilities for which claims are made, shall be in the same order as for a state bank as provided in section 524.1312, subsection 2.\n\nc. The claim of a public funds depositor for purposes of this section shall be the amount of the depositor’s public funds deposits plus interest to the date the funds are distributed to the public funds depositor at the rate the bank agreed to pay on the public funds reduced by the portion of the public funds that is insured by federal deposit insurance.\n\nd. If the loss of public funds is not covered by federal deposit insurance and the proceeds of the closed bank’s assets that are liquidated within thirty days of the closing of the bank are not sufficient to cover the loss, then any further payments to cover the loss will come from the state sinking fund for public deposits in banks. If the balance in that sinking fund is inadequate to pay the entire loss, then the treasurer shall obtain the additional amount needed by making an assessment against other banks whose public funds deposits exceed federal deposit insurance coverage. A bank’s assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of the remaining loss to all public depositors in the closed bank by a percentage that represents the assessed bank’s proportional share of the total of uninsured public funds deposits held by all banks and all branches of out-of-state banks, based upon the average of the uninsured public funds of the assessed bank or branch of an out-of-state bank as of the end of the four calendar quarters prior to the date of closing of the closed bank and the average of the uninsured public funds in all banks and branches of out-of-state banks as of the end of the four calendar quarters prior to the date of closing of the closed bank, excluding the amount of uninsured public funds held by the closed bank at the end of the four calendar quarters. Each bank shall pay its assessment to the treasurer of state within three business days after it receives notice of assessment. For purposes of this section, when calculating uninsured public funds, a bank shall include all deposits of customers of other financial institutions as permitted by section 12B.10, subsection 7.\n\ne. If a bank fails to pay its assessment when due, the treasurer of state shall make additional assessments as may be necessary against other banks that hold uninsured public funds to satisfy any unpaid assessment. Any additional assessments shall be determined, collected, and satisfied in the same manner as the first assessment except that in calculating the amount of each such additional assessment, the amount of uninsured public funds held by the bank that fails to pay the assessment shall not be counted.\n\nf. If a bank fails to pay its assessment when due, the treasurer of state shall notify the superintendent or the comptroller of the currency, as applicable, of the failure to pay the assessment. If the bank that has failed to pay the assessment is a nationally chartered financial institution, the superintendent shall immediately notify the bank’s primary federal regulator. If the assessment is not paid within thirty days after the bank received the notice of assessment, the treasurer of state shall initiate a lawsuit to collect the amount of the assessment. If a bank is found to have failed to pay the assessment as required by this subsection and is ordered to pay the assessment, the court shall also order that the bank pay court costs and reasonable attorney fees based on the amount of time the attorney general’s office spent preparing and bringing the action, and reasonable expenses incurred by the treasurer of state.\n\ng. Following collection of the assessments, the treasurer of state shall distribute funds to the public depositors of the closed bank according to their validated claims unless a public depositor requests in writing that the claims of other public depositors be paid prior to payment to the public depositor making the request. By receiving payment under this section, a public depositor shall be deemed to have assigned to the treasurer of state any claim the public depositor may have against the closed bank by reason of the deposit of its public funds and all rights the public depositor may have in funds that subsequently become available to depositors of the closed bank.\n\n99 Acts, ch 117, §12, 15; 99 Acts, ch 208, §44, 45, 74; 2002 Acts, ch 1096, §9, 17; 2003 Acts, ch 44, §7; 2004 Acts, ch 1080, §4 – 7; 2006 Acts, ch 1023, §6; 2010 Acts, ch 1028, §3, 14; 2012 Acts, ch 1051, §4\n\nReferred to in §12C.1, 12C.22, 12C.25",

Not accept uninsured public funds deposits.\n\nb. Reduce the amount of uninsured public funds accepted.\n\nc. Return to the depositors some or all uninsured public funds held in demand deposits and, when deposit instruments or agreements mature, return to the depositors some or all uninsured deposits representing proceeds of such instruments or agreements.\n\nd.
