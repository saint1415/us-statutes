Before an appropriation of any department or establishment becomes available, the department or establishment shall submit to the director of the department of management a requisition for allotment of the appropriation according to dates identified in the requisition during the fiscal year by which portions of the appropriation will be needed. The department or establishment shall submit the requisition by June 1, prior to the start of a fiscal year or by another date identified by the director. The requisition shall contain details of proposed expenditures as may be required by the director subject to review by the governor.\n\nb. The director of the department of management shall approve the allotments subject to review by the governor, unless it is found that the estimated budget resources during the fiscal year are insufficient to pay all appropriations in full, in which event such allotments may be modified to the extent the governor may deem necessary in order that there shall be no overdraft or deficit in the several funds of the state at the end of the fiscal year, and the director shall submit copies of the allotments thus approved or modified to the head of the department or establishment concerned, who shall set up such allotments on the books and be governed accordingly in the control of expenditures.\n\n2. Allotments made in accordance with subsection 1 may be subsequently modified by the director of the department of management at the direction of the governor either upon the written request of the head of the department or establishment concerned, or in the event the governor finds that the estimated budget resources during the fiscal year are insufficient to pay all appropriations in full, upon the governor’s own initiative to the extent the governor may deem necessary in order that there shall be no overdraft or deficit in the several funds of the state at the end of the fiscal year; and the head of the department or establishment shall be given notice of a modification in the same way as in the case of original allotments.\n\n3. The allotment requests of all departments and establishments collecting governmental fees and other revenue which supplement a state appropriation shall attach to the summary of requests a statement showing how much of the proposed allotments are to be financed from state appropriations, stores, and repayment receipts.\n\n4. The procedure to be employed in controlling the expenditures and receipts of the state fair board and the institutions under the state board of regents, whose collections are not deposited in the state treasury, is that outlined in section 8A.502, subsection 8.\n\n5. If the governor determines that the estimated budget resources during the fiscal year are insufficient to pay all appropriations in full, the reductions shall be uniform and prorated between all departments, agencies, and establishments upon the basis of their respective appropriations.\n\n6.

However, with the prior written consent and approval of the governor and the director of the department of management, the governing board or head of any state department, institution, or agency may, at any time during the fiscal year, make a whole or partial intradepartmental transfer of its unexpended appropriations for purposes within the scope of such department, institution, or agency. Such transfer shall be to an appropriation made from the same funding source and within the same fiscal year. The amount of a transfer made from an appropriation under this subsection shall be limited to not more than one-tenth of one percent of the total of all appropriations made from the funding source of the transferred appropriation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is made.\n\n2. If the appropriation of a department, institution, or agency is insufficient to properly meet the legitimate expenses of the department, institution, or agency, the director, with the approval of the governor, may make an interdepartmental transfer from any other department, institution, or agency of the state having an appropriation in excess of its needs, of sufficient funds to meet that deficiency. Such transfer shall be to an appropriation made from the same funding source and within the same fiscal year. The amount of a transfer made from an appropriation under this subsection shall be limited to not more than one-tenth of one percent of the total of all appropriations made from the funding source of the transferred appropriation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is made. An interdepartmental transfer to an appropriation which is not an entitlement appropriation is not authorized when the general assembly is in regular session and, in addition, the sum of interdepartmental transfers in a fiscal year to an appropriation which is not an entitlement appropriation shall not exceed fifty percent of the amount of the appropriation as enacted by the general assembly. For the purposes of this subsection, an entitlement appropriation is a line item appropriation to the state public defender for indigent defense or to the department of health and human services for foster care, state supplementary assistance, medical assistance, or for the family investment program.\n\n3. The aggregate amount of intradepartmental and interdepartmental transfers made from all appropriations for a fiscal year pursuant to this section is limited to not more than five-tenths of one percent of the total amount of the appropriations made from the general fund of the state for the fiscal year.

The notice from the director shall include information concerning the amount of the proposed transfer, the departments, institutions, or agencies affected by the proposed transfer and the reasons for the proposed transfer. Chairpersons notified shall be given at least two weeks to review and comment on the proposed transfer before the transfer of funds is made.\n\n5. a. Any transfer made under the provisions of this section shall be reported to the legislative fiscal committee on a monthly basis. The report shall cover each calendar month and shall be due the tenth day of the following month.

To the extent allowed by federal law, the block grant plan shall be developed in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) The primary goal of the plan shall be to attain savings for taxpayers and to avoid shifting costs from the federal government to state and local governments.\n\n(2) State agency planning meetings shall be held jointly with officials of the affected political subdivision and affected members of the public.\n\n(3) The plan shall address proposed expenditures and accountability measures and shall be published so as to provide reasonable opportunity for public review and comment.\n\n(4) (a) Preference shall be given to any existing service delivery system capable of delivering the required service.
