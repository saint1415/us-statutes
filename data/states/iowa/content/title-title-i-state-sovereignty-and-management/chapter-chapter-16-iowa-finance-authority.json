There exists a serious shortage of safe and sanitary residential housing available to low or moderate income families.\n\n2. This shortage is conducive to disease, crime, environmental decline and poverty and impairs the economic value of large areas, which are characterized by depreciated values, impaired investments, and reduced capacity to pay taxes and are a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the state.\n\n3. These conditions result in a loss in population and further deterioration, accompanied by added costs to communities for creation of new public facilities and services elsewhere.\n\n4. One major cause of this condition has been recurrent shortages of funds in private channels.\n\n5. These shortages have contributed to reductions in construction of new residential units, and have made the sale and purchase of existing residential units a virtual impossibility in many parts of the state.\n\n6. The ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions.\n\n7. A stable supply of adequate funds for residential financing is required to encourage new housing and the rehabilitation of existing housing in an orderly and sustained manner and to reduce the problems described in this section.\n\n8. It is necessary to create a state finance authority to encourage the investment of private capital and stimulate the construction and rehabilitation of adequate housing through the use of public financing.\n\n9. The interest costs paid by group homes of fifteen beds or less licensed as health care facilities or child foster care facilities for facility acquisition and indirectly reimbursed by the department of health and human services through payments for patients at those facilities who are recipients of medical assistance or state supplementary assistance are severe drains on the state’s budget. A reduction in these costs obtained through financing with tax-exempt revenue bonds would clearly be in the public interest.\n\n10. There is a need in areas of the state for new construction of certain group homes of fifteen beds or less licensed as health care facilities or child foster care facilities to provide adequate housing and care for elderly Iowans and Iowans with disabilities, and to provide adequate housing and foster care for children.\n\n11. There is a need to provide for early intensive intervention on behalf of juveniles which is designed to meet the juveniles’ needs and prevent future antisocial and criminal behavior and there is a need in areas of the state to establish facilities providing residential housing or treatment facilities for juveniles requiring a more enhanced level of services than those services currently available in the state’s existing foster care system.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §220.3; 82 Acts, ch 1187, §4]\n\n83 Acts, ch 96, §157, 159; 85 Acts, ch 252, §27; 90 Acts, ch 1239, §5\n\n96 Acts, ch 1129, §10; 2007 Acts, ch 54, §13; 2008 Acts, ch 1031, §16; 2014 Acts, ch 1080, §12, 78; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §28\n\nSubsection 9 amended",

The authority shall seek to encourage cooperative housing efforts at the local level, both with respect to the cooperation of public bodies with private enterprise and civic groups, and with respect to the formation of regional or multicity units engaged in housing.\n\n6. With respect to programs relating to housing, wherever practicable, the authority shall give preference to the following types of programs:\n\na. Those which treat housing problems in the context of the total needs of individuals and communities, recognizing that individuals may have other problems and needs closely related to their need for adequate housing, and that the development of isolated housing units without regard for neighborhood and community development tends to create undesirable consequences.\n\nb. Those which promote home ownership by families of low or moderate income, recognizing the need for educational counseling programs in family financial management and home maintenance in order to achieve this goal.\n\nc.

Those designed to serve elderly families, families which include one or more persons with disabilities, lower income families, or very low income families.\n\n7.

      "text": "16.4A Legislative findings — agricultural development.\n\nThe general assembly finds and declares all of the following:\n\n1. There exists a serious problem in this state regarding the ability of nonestablished farmers to acquire agricultural land and agricultural improvements and depreciable agricultural property in order to enter farming.\n\n2. This barrier to entry into farming is conducive to consolidation of acreage of agricultural land with fewer individuals resulting in a grave threat to the traditional family farm.\n\n3. These conditions result in a loss in population, unemployment, and a movement of persons from rural communities to urban areas accompanied by added costs to communities for creation of new public facilities and services.\n\n4. One major cause of this condition has been recurrent shortages of funds in private channels and the high interest cost of borrowing.\n\n5. These shortages and costs have made the sale and purchase of agricultural land to beginning farmers a virtual impossibility in many parts of the state.\n\n6. The ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions.\n\n7. A stable supply of adequate funds for agricultural financing is required to encourage beginning farmers in an orderly and sustained manner and to reduce the problems described in this section.\n\nArticle IX, 2nd subarticle, section 3, of the Constitution of the State of Iowa\n\nrequires that, “The General Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement,” and agricultural improvement and the public good are served by a policy of facilitating access to capital by beginning farmers unable to obtain capital elsewhere in order to preserve, encourage, and protect the family farm which has been the economic, political, and social backbone of rural Iowa.\n\n9. It is necessary to create a program to encourage ownership of farms by beginning farmers by providing purchase money loans to beginning farmers who are not able to obtain adequate capital elsewhere to provide such funds and to lower costs through the use of public financing.\n\n10. There exists a serious problem in this state regarding the ability of farmers to obtain affordable operating loans for reasonable and necessary expenses and cash flow requirements of farming.\n\n11. Farming is one of the principal pursuits of the inhabitants of this state. Many other industries and pursuits, in turn, are wholly dependent upon farming.\n\n12. The inability of farmers to obtain affordable operating loans is conducive to a general decline of the economy in this state.\n\n13. A serious problem continues to exist in this state regarding the ability of agricultural producers to obtain, retain, restructure, or service loans or other financing on a reasonable and affordable basis for operating expenses, cash flow requirements, and capital asset acquisition or maintenance.\n\n14. Because the Iowa economy is dependent upon the production and marketing of agricultural produce, the inability of agricultural producers to obtain, retain, restructure, or service loans or other financing on a reasonable and an affordable basis for operating expenses, cash flow requirements, or capital asset acquisition or maintenance contributes to a general decline of the state’s economy.\n\n2014 Acts, ch 1080, §14, 78",

Neither the resolution, trust agreement, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created needs to be recorded or filed under the Iowa uniform commercial code, chapter 554, to be valid, binding, or effective against the parties.\n\n8. Neither the members of the authority nor any person executing its bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be liable personally on the bonds, notes, or other obligations or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the authority’s bonds or notes.\n\n9. The authority may make or participate in the making of loans to housing sponsors to provide interim construction financing for the construction or rehabilitation of adequate housing for low or moderate income persons or families, elderly persons or families, and persons or families which include one or more persons with disabilities, and of noninstitutional residential care facilities.

For the purposes of this section, the term “bond reserve fund requirement” means, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money, as provided in the resolutions of the authority authorizing the bonds with respect to which the fund is established, equal to not more than ten percent of the outstanding principal amount of bonds of the authority secured in whole or in part by the fund.\n\n4.

Subject to the limitations described in subsections 5, 6, and 7, the authority shall determine the amount of the tax credit under an agreement using the following methods:\n\na. In the case of an agreement on a fixed basis, in which an eligible taxpayer receives a fixed cash rent payment, the amount of the tax credit equals five percent of the amount of the fixed cash rent payment for each year.\n\nb.

A tax credit in excess of the eligible taxpayer’s tax liability for the tax year is not refundable but may be credited to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the eligible taxpayer redeems the tax credit.\n\n8. a. To claim a tax credit under this section, an eligible taxpayer shall include one or more tax credit certificates with the eligible taxpayer’s tax return pursuant to rules adopted by the department.\n\nb. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other person other than the eligible taxpayer’s estate or trust upon the eligible taxpayer’s death pursuant to rules adopted by the department.\n\n9.

Any tax credit properly claimed by the eligible taxpayer prior to the date of termination or for the year during which the termination occurred shall be allowed except as provided in paragraph “b”, but no additional tax credits may be issued or claimed under the program for that agreement.

The authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of its bonds or notes for the economic development program that the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes are payable exclusively from any of the following:\n\na. The income and receipts or other money derived from the projects financed with the proceeds of the bonds or notes.\n\nb. The income and receipts or other money derived from designated projects whether or not the projects are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the bonds or notes.\n\nc. The authority’s income and receipts of other assets generally, or a designated part or parts of them.\n\n2. a. For the purpose of securing one or more issues of its bonds or notes, the authority may establish one or more special funds, called “capital reserve funds”. The authority may pay into the capital reserve funds the proceeds of the sale of its bonds or notes and other money which may be made available to the authority from other sources for the purposes of the capital reserve funds. Except as provided in this section, money in a capital reserve fund shall be used only as required for any of the following:\n\n(1) The payment of the principal of and interest on bonds or notes or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds or notes.\n\n(2) The purchase or redemption of the bonds or notes.\n\n(3) The payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds or notes are redeemed before maturity.\n\nb. However, money in a capital reserve fund shall not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purpose of making payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums on the bonds or notes, and making sinking fund payments when other money pledged to the payment of the bonds or notes is not available for the payments. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund from the investment of all or part of the fund may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority if the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.\n\n3. If the authority decides to issue bonds or notes secured by a capital reserve fund, the bonds or notes shall not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than the capital reserve fund requirement, unless at the time of issuance of the bonds or notes the authority deposits in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds or notes to be issued or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement.\n\n4. In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the fund is invested shall be valued by a reasonable method established by the authority by resolution. Valuation shall include the amount of interest earned or accrued as of the date of valuation.\n\n5. In this section, “capital reserve fund requirement” means the amount required to be on deposit in the capital reserve fund as of the date of computation as determined by resolution of the authority.\n\n6. To assure maintenance of the capital reserve funds, the chairperson of the authority shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year, make and deliver to the governor the chairperson’s certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore each capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement for that fund. Within thirty days after the beginning of the session of the general assembly next following the delivery of the certificate, the governor may submit to both houses printed copies of a budget including the sum, if any, required to restore each capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement for that fund. Any sums appropriated by the general assembly and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be deposited by the authority in the applicable capital reserve fund.\n\n7. All amounts paid to the authority by the state pursuant to this section shall be considered advances by the state to the authority and, subject to the rights of the holders of any bonds or notes of the authority that have previously been issued or will be issued, shall be repaid to the state without interest from all available operating revenues of the authority in excess of amounts required for the payment of bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority, the capital reserve fund, and operating expenses.\n\n8. If any amount deposited in a capital reserve fund is withdrawn for payment of principal, premium, or interest on the bonds or notes or sinking fund payments with respect to bonds or notes thus reducing the amount of that fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, the authority shall immediately notify the general assembly of this event and shall take steps to restore the capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement for that fund from any amounts designated as being available for such purpose.\n\n9. The authority may establish reserve funds, other than capital reserve funds, to secure one or more issues of its bonds or notes. The authority may deposit in a reserve fund established under this subsection the proceeds of the sale of its bonds or notes and other money which is made available from any other source. The authority may allow a reserve fund established under this subsection to be depleted without complying with subsection 6 or subsection 8.\n\n10. It is the intention of the general assembly that a pledge made in respect of bonds or notes shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, that the money or property so pledged and received after the pledge by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act, and that the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority whether or not the parties have notice of the lien. Neither the resolution, trust agreement, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created needs to be recorded or filed under the Iowa uniform commercial code, chapter 554, to be valid, binding, or effective against the parties.\n\n11. Neither the members of the authority nor a person executing the bonds or notes are liable personally on the bonds or notes or are subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds or notes.\n\n12. The bonds or notes issued by the authority are not an indebtedness or other liability of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, and are payable solely from the income and receipts or other funds or property of the authority which are designated in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of the bonds or notes as being available as security for bonds or notes. The authority shall not pledge the faith or credit of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, to the payment of a bond or note. The issuance of a bond or note by the authority does not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or a political subdivision of the state to apply money from, or levy or pledge any form of taxation whatever to the payment of the bond or note.\n\n86 Acts, ch 1212, §6\n\nC87, §220.105\n\nC93, §16.105\n\n2005 Acts, ch 3, §13; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2014 Acts, ch 1080, §71, 72, 78",
