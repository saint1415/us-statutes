Decisions regarding settlement of the case shall be reserved exclusively to the discretion of the government attorney and the state.\n\nf. A government attorney with supervisory authority for the case shall participate in all settlement conferences.\n\n5. Copies of any executed contingency fee contract as well as the attorney general’s written determination to enter into a contingency fee contract with a private attorney shall be posted on the attorney general’s internet site for public inspection within five business days after the date the contract is executed and shall remain posted on the internet site for the duration of the contingency fee contract, including any extensions or amendments thereto. Any payment of contingency fees shall be posted on the attorney general’s internet site within fifteen days after the payment of such contingency fees to the private attorney and shall remain posted on the internet site for at least one year thereafter.\n\n6.
