The design consists of three vertical stripes of blue, white, and red, the blue stripe being nearest the staff and the white stripe* being in the center. On the central white stripe is depicted a spreading eagle bearing in its beak blue streamers on which is inscribed the state motto, “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain” in white letters, with the word “Iowa” in red letters below the streamers.\n\n[C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §468; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §31.1]\n\n95 Acts, ch 1, §1\n\n*Editor’s Note: On the original design, the white stripe was about equal to the sum of the others",
