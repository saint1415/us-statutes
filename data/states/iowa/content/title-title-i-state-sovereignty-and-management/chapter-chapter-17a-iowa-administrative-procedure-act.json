      "text": "17A.1 Citation and statement of purpose.\n\n1. This chapter may be cited as the “Iowa Administrative Procedure Act”.\n\n2. This chapter is intended to provide a minimum procedural code for the operation of all state agencies when they take action affecting the rights and duties of the public. Nothing in this chapter is meant to discourage agencies from adopting procedures providing greater protections to the public or conferring additional rights upon the public; and save for express provisions of this chapter to the contrary, nothing in this chapter is meant to abrogate in whole or in part any statute prescribing procedural duties for an agency which are greater than or in addition to those provided here. This chapter is meant to apply to all rulemaking and contested case proceedings and all suits for the judicial review of agency action that are not specifically excluded from this chapter or some portion thereof by its express terms or by the express terms of another chapter.\n\n3. The purposes of this chapter are: To provide legislative oversight of powers and duties delegated to administrative agencies; to increase public accountability of administrative agencies; to simplify government by assuring a uniform minimum procedure to which all agencies will be held in the conduct of their most important functions; to increase public access to governmental information; to increase public participation in the formulation of administrative rules; to increase the fairness of agencies in their conduct of contested case proceedings; and to simplify the process of judicial review of agency action as well as increase its ease and availability.\n\n4. In accomplishing its objectives, the intention of this chapter is to strike a fair balance between these purposes and the need for efficient, economical and effective government administration. The chapter is not meant to alter the substantive rights of any person or agency. Its impact is limited to procedural rights with the expectation that better substantive results will be achieved in the everyday conduct of state government by improving the process by which those results are attained.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §17A.1]\n\n2005 Acts, ch 3, §15; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §135",

Adopt as a rule a description of the organization of the agency which states the general course and method of its operations, the administrative subdivisions of the agency and the programs implemented by each of them, a statement of the mission of the agency, and the methods by which and location where the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests.\n\nb. Adopt rules of practice setting forth the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available to the public, including a description of all forms and instructions that are to be used by the public in dealing with the agency.\n\nc. As soon as feasible and to the extent practicable, adopt rules, in addition to those otherwise required by this chapter, embodying appropriate standards, principles, and procedural safeguards that the agency will apply to the law it administers.\n\nd. Make available for public inspection all rules, and make available for public inspection and index by subject, all other written statements of law or policy, or interpretations formulated, adopted, or used by the agency in the discharge of its functions. Except as otherwise required by Constitution or statute, or in the use of discovery under the Iowa rules of civil procedure or in criminal cases, an agency shall not be required to make available for public inspection those portions of its staff manuals, instructions, or other statements excluded from the definition of “rule” by section 17A.2, subsection 11, paragraph “f”.\n\ne. Make available for public inspection and index by name and subject all final orders, decisions, and opinions: Provided that to the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or trade secrets, an agency shall delete identifying details when it makes available for public inspection any final order, decision, or opinion; however, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.\n\n2. No agency rule or other written statement of law or policy, or interpretation, order, decision, or opinion is valid or effective against any person or party, nor shall it be invoked by the agency for any purpose, until it has been made available for public inspection and indexed as required by subsection 1, paragraphs “d” and “e”.

      "text": "17A.4 Procedure for adoption of rules.\n\n1. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule an agency shall:\n\na. Give notice of its intended action by submitting the notice to the administrative rules coordinator and the administrative code editor. The administrative rules coordinator shall assign an ARC number to each rulemaking document. The administrative code editor shall publish each notice meeting the requirements of this chapter in the Iowa administrative bulletin created pursuant to section 2B.5A. The legislative services agency shall provide the chairpersons and ranking members of the appropriate standing committees of the general assembly a means to receive an electronic copy of the notice for additional study. Any notice of intended action shall be published at least thirty-five days in advance of the action. The notice shall include a statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects and issues involved, and the time when, the place where, and the manner in which interested persons may present their views.\n\nb. Afford all interested persons not less than twenty days to submit data, views, or arguments in writing. If timely requested in writing by twenty-five interested persons, by a governmental subdivision, by the administrative rules review committee, by an agency, or by an association having not less than twenty-five members, the agency must give interested persons an opportunity to make oral presentation. The opportunity for oral presentation must be held at least twenty days after publication of the notice of its time and place in the Iowa administrative bulletin. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule. Within one hundred eighty days following either the notice published according to the provisions of paragraph “a” or within one hundred eighty days after the last date of the oral presentations on the proposed rule, whichever is later, the agency shall adopt a rule pursuant to the rulemaking proceeding or shall terminate the proceeding by publishing notice of termination in the Iowa administrative bulletin.\n\nc. Mail the number of copies of the proposed rule as requested to the state office of a trade or occupational association which has registered its name and address with the agency. The trade or occupational association shall reimburse the agency for the actual cost incurred in providing the copies of the proposed rule under this paragraph. Failure to provide copies as provided in this paragraph shall not be grounds for the invalidation of a rule, unless that failure was deliberate on the part of that agency or the result of gross negligence.\n\n2. An agency shall include in a preamble to each rule it adopts a brief explanation of the principal reasons for its action and, if applicable, a brief explanation of the principal reasons for its failure to provide in that rule for the waiver of the rule in specified situations if no such waiver provision is included in the rule. This explanatory requirement does not apply when the agency adopts a rule that only defines the meaning of a provision of law if the agency does not possess delegated authority to bind the courts to any extent with its definition. In addition, if requested to do so by an interested person, either prior to adoption or within thirty days thereafter, the agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against the rule adopted, incorporating therein the reasons for overruling considerations urged against the rule. This concise statement shall be issued either at the time of the adoption of the rule or within thirty-five days after the agency receives the request.\n\n3. a. When the statute so provides, or with the approval of the administrative rules review committee, if the committee finds good cause that notice and public participation would be unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary to the public interest, the provisions of subsection 1 shall be inapplicable.\n\nb. (1) If the administrative rules review committee by a two-thirds vote, the governor, or the attorney general files with the administrative code editor an objection to the adoption of a rule or portion of a rule pursuant to this subsection, the rule or portion of the rule shall cease to be effective one hundred eighty days after the date the objection was filed.\n\n(2) If the administrative rules review committee files with the administrative code editor an objection to the adoption of a rule or portion of a rule pursuant to this subsection, the administrative rules review committee, by a separate two-thirds vote, may suspend the applicability of the rule or portion of the rule until the rule ceases to be effective under this paragraph “b”. The determination to suspend the applicability of the rule or portion of the rule shall be included in the copy of the objection to be forwarded to the agency.\n\nc. If an objection to a rule is filed under this subsection, a copy of the objection, properly dated, shall be forwarded to the agency at the time of filing the objection. In any action contesting a rule or portion of a rule adopted pursuant to this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the agency to show that the procedures of subsection 1 were impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\n\n4. Any rule filed pursuant to this section or section 17A.5, that necessitates additional annual expenditures of at least one hundred thousand dollars or combined expenditures of at least five hundred thousand dollars within five years by all affected persons, including the agency itself, shall be accompanied by a fiscal impact statement outlining the expenditures. The agency shall promptly deliver a copy of the statement to the legislative services agency. To the extent feasible, the legislative services agency shall analyze the statement and provide a summary of that analysis to the administrative rules review committee. If the agency has made a good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of this subsection, the rule shall not be invalidated on the ground that the contents of the statement are insufficient or inaccurate.\n\n5. A rule is not valid unless adopted in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section that are in effect at the time of adoption of the rule. However, a rule shall be conclusively presumed to have been made in compliance with all of the procedural requirements of this section if it has not been invalidated on the grounds of noncompliance in a proceeding commenced within two years after its effective date.\n\n6. a. If the administrative rules review committee created by section 17A.8, the governor, or the attorney general finds objection to all or some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because that rule is deemed to be unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise beyond the authority delegated to the agency, the committee, governor, or attorney general may, in writing, notify the agency of the objection. In the case of a rule filed without notice pursuant to subsection 3, or a rule made effective under section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph “b”, the committee, governor, or attorney general may notify the agency of such an objection. The committee, governor, or attorney general shall also file a certified copy of such an objection in the office of the administrative code editor and a notice to the effect that an objection has been filed shall be published in the next issue of the Iowa administrative bulletin and in the Iowa administrative code when that rule is printed in it. The burden of proof shall then be on the agency in any proceeding for judicial review or for enforcement of the rule heard subsequent to the filing to establish that the rule or portion of the rule objected to according to the above procedure is not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise beyond the authority delegated to it.\n\nb. If the agency fails to meet the burden of proof prescribed for a rule objected to according to the provisions of paragraph “a”, the court shall declare the rule or portion of the rule objected to invalid and judgment shall be rendered against the agency for court costs. Such court costs shall include a reasonable attorney fee and shall be payable by the director of the department of administrative services from the support appropriations of the agency which adopted the rule in question.\n\n7. The governor may rescind an adopted rule by executive order within seventy days of the rule becoming effective. The governor shall provide a copy of the executive order to the administrative code editor who shall include it in the next publication of the Iowa administrative bulletin.\n\n8. Upon the vote of two-thirds of its members, the administrative rules review committee, following notice of intended action as provided in subsection 1 and prior to adoption of a rule pursuant to that notice, may suspend the agency from adopting that notice for seventy days. Notice that adoption of a notice of intended action was suspended under this provision shall be published in the Iowa administrative code and bulletin.\n\n9. a. If a provision of an Act of the general assembly expressly requires rulemaking by an agency, or if another statute that governs or is directly related to a provision of an Act of the general assembly expressly requires rulemaking by an agency, the agency shall make one of the following submissions regarding such rulemaking within one hundred eighty days of the date on which the provision becomes effective:\n\n(1) Submit a notice of intended action to the administrative rules coordinator and the administrative code editor pursuant to subsection 1.\n\n(2) Submit written notification to the administrative rules review committee that the agency has not submitted a notice of intended action to the administrative rules coordinator and the administrative code editor pursuant to subsection 1. The notification shall include the provision of the Act of the general assembly for which rulemaking is required, the subject matter of the provision, an explanation of the delay in the submission of a notice of intended action, and an estimated timeline for submission of a notice of intended action.\n\nb. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit an agency from conducting rulemaking relating to a provision of an Act of the general assembly for which a submission was not made pursuant to paragraph “a”. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit an agency from conducting additional rulemaking subsequent to completion of any rulemaking for which a submission was made pursuant to paragraph “a”.\n\n[C66, 71, §17A.6, 17A.7; C73, §17A.6, 17A.7, 17A.17; C75, 77, 79, 81, §17A.4]\n\n83 Acts, ch 142, §9; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §2038; 90 Acts, ch 1266, §32; 91 Acts, ch 258, §17, 18; 98 Acts, ch 1202, §8, 9, 46; 2003 Acts, ch 35, §27, 49; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2006 Acts, ch 1011, §2; 2008 Acts, ch 1031, §80; 2010 Acts, ch 1031, §52, 58; 2013 Acts, ch 114, §1 – 3; 2014 Acts, ch 1092, §13 – 15; 2016 Acts, ch 1126, §1 – 3; 2020 Acts, ch 1090, §2, 3; 2023 Acts, ch 70, §5, 6, 14\n\nReferred to in §2B.5A, 2B.17, 17A.4A, 17A.4B, 17A.6, 17A.7, 17A.8, 35A.13, 68B.2, 100B.22, 124.201A, 135C.2, 163.30, 204.3, 249A.3, 249A.20A, 249A.21, 267.6, 455B.105, 459.301, 479.29, 479B.20, 502.321B, 505.18A, 514B.4A, 519A.4\n\nRules mandating expenditures by political subdivisions; limitations; fiscal impact statements; §25B.6\n\n2023 amendments to subsection 1, paragraph a and subsection 8 effective January 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 70, §14\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph a amended\n\nSubsection 8 amended",

An agency may request that such information be submitted to the agency.\n\n6. If a jobs impact statement is revised after a notice of intended action or a rule filed without notice pursuant to section 17A.4, subsection 3, is published, the revised jobs impact statement shall be published as part of the preamble to the adopted version of the rule, unless the administrative rules coordinator determines that publication of the entire jobs impact statement would be unnecessary or impractical.\n\n7. The analysis in the jobs impact statement shall give particular weight to jobs in production sectors of the economy which includes the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of the economy and shall include analysis, where applicable, of the impact of the rule on expansion of existing businesses or facilities.\n\n8.

Each agency shall adopt rules that provide for the form, contents, and filing of petitions for declaratory orders, the procedural rights of persons in relation to the petitions, and the disposition of the petitions. The rules must describe the classes of circumstances in which the agency will not issue a declaratory order and must be consistent with the public interest and with the general policy of this chapter to facilitate and encourage agency issuance of reliable advice.\n\n3. Within fifteen days after receipt of a petition for a declaratory order, an agency shall give notice of the petition to all persons to whom notice is required by any provision of law and may give notice to any other persons.\n\n4. Persons who qualify under any applicable provision of law as an intervenor and who file timely petitions for intervention according to agency rules may intervene in proceedings for declaratory orders.

An agency shall not grant a petition for waiver of a rule unless the agency has jurisdiction over the rule and the waiver is consistent with any applicable statute, constitutional provision, or other provision of law. In addition, this section does not authorize an agency to waive any requirement created or duty imposed by statute.\n\n2. Upon petition of a person, an agency may in its sole discretion issue a waiver from the requirements of a rule if the agency finds, based on clear and convincing evidence, all of the following:\n\na. The application of the rule would pose an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested.\n\nb. The waiver from the requirements of a rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person.\n\nc. The provisions of a rule subject to a petition for a waiver are not specifically mandated by statute or another provision of law.\n\nd. Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested.\n\n3. The burden of persuasion rests with the person who petitions an agency for the waiver of a rule. Each petition for a waiver shall be evaluated by the agency based on the unique, individual circumstances set out in the petition. A waiver, if granted, shall be drafted by the agency so as to provide the narrowest exception possible to the provisions of the rule. The agency may place any condition on a waiver that the agency finds desirable to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. A waiver shall not be permanent, unless the petitioner can show that a temporary waiver would be impracticable. If a temporary waiver is granted, there is no automatic right to renewal. At the sole discretion of the agency, a waiver may be renewed if the agency finds all of the factors set out in subsection 2 remain valid.\n\n4. A grant or denial of a waiver petition shall be indexed, filed, and available for public inspection as provided in section 17A.3. The administrative code editor and the administrative rules coordinator shall maintain an internet site to identify rules for which a petition for a waiver has been granted or denied and make this information available to the public. When an agency grants or denies a waiver, the agency shall submit the information required by this subsection on the internet site within sixty days. The internet site shall identify the rules for which a waiver has been granted or denied, the number of times a waiver was granted or denied for each rule, a citation to the statutory provisions implemented by these rules, and a general summary of the reasons justifying the agencies’ actions on the waiver request. To the extent practicable, the agency shall include information detailing the extent to which the granting of a waiver has established a precedent for additional waivers and the extent to which the granting of a waiver has affected the general applicability of the rule itself.\n\n5.

When the agency presides at the reception of the evidence in a contested case, the decision of the agency is a final decision.\n\n2. When the agency did not preside at the reception of the evidence in a contested case, the presiding officer shall make a proposed decision. Findings of fact shall be prepared by the officer presiding at the reception of the evidence in a contested case unless the officer becomes unavailable to the agency. If the officer is unavailable, the findings of fact may be prepared by another person qualified to be a presiding officer who has read the record, unless demeanor of witnesses is a substantial factor.

On appeal from or review of the proposed decision, the agency has all the power which it would have in initially making the final decision except as it may limit the issues on notice to the parties or by rule. The agency may reverse or modify any finding of fact if a preponderance of the evidence will support a determination to reverse or modify such a finding, or may reverse or modify any conclusion of law that the agency finds to be in error.

This section shall not preclude an agency from instituting a system whereby the proposed decision of a presiding officer in a contested case may be appealed to, or reviewed on motion of, a body consisting of one or more persons that is between the presiding officer and the agency. If an agency institutes such a system of intermediate review, the proposed decision of the presiding officer becomes the final decision of the agency without further proceedings unless there is an appeal to, or review on motion of, the intermediate reviewing body within the time provided by rule. An intermediate reviewing body may be vested with all or a part of the power which it would have in initially making the decision.

In deciding an appeal from or review of a proposed decision of the first agency, the second agency shall have all those powers conferred upon it by statute and shall afford each party an opportunity to file exceptions, present briefs and, with its consent, present oral arguments to agency members who are to render the final decision.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §17A.15]\n\n98 Acts, ch 1202, §17, 46\n\nReferred to in §10A.321, 10A.330, 10A.801, 17A.9, 225C.61, 421.17",

Unless otherwise required by a provision of law, the agency record need not constitute the exclusive basis for agency action in emergency adjudicative proceedings or for judicial review thereof.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1202, §21, 46; 2006 Acts, ch 1030, §5\n\nReferred to in §124.305, 163.3E, 165B.5, 207.14, 235E.2, 421.17, 459.314B, 502.412, 507A.10, 507B.6A, 508E.16, 515I.12, 523A.805, 523C.19, 523D.13, 523I.203, 533A.7, 533D.12, 535B.7, 535D.13, 536.9, 536A.18",

      "text": "17A.19 Judicial review.\n\nExcept as expressly provided otherwise by another statute referring to this chapter by name, the judicial review provisions of this chapter shall be the exclusive means by which a person or party who is aggrieved or adversely affected by agency action may seek judicial review of such agency action. However, nothing in this chapter shall abridge or deny to any person or party who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any agency action the right to seek relief from such action in the courts.\n\n1. A person or party who has exhausted all adequate administrative remedies and who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any final agency action is entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter. When agency action is pursuant to rate regulatory powers over public utilities or common carriers and the aggrievement or adverse effect is to the rates or charges of a public utility or common carrier, the agency action shall not be final until all agency remedies have been exhausted and a decision prescribing rates which satisfy the requirements of those provisions of the Code has been rendered. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action is immediately reviewable if all adequate administrative remedies have been exhausted and review of the final agency action would not provide an adequate remedy. If a declaratory order has not been rendered within sixty days after the filing of a petition therefor under section 17A.9, or by such later time as agreed by the parties, or if the agency declines to issue such a declaratory order after receipt of a petition therefor, any administrative remedy available under section 17A.9 shall be deemed inadequate or exhausted.\n\n2. Proceedings for judicial review shall be instituted by filing a petition either in Polk county district court or in the district court for the county in which the petitioner resides or has its principal place of business. When a proceeding for judicial review has been commenced, a court may, in the interest of justice, transfer the proceeding to another county where the venue is proper. Within ten days after the filing of a petition for judicial review the petitioner shall serve by the means provided in the Iowa rules of civil procedure for the personal service of an original notice, or shall mail copies of the petition to all parties named in the petition and, if the petition involves review of agency action in a contested case, all parties of record in that case before the agency. Such personal service or mailing shall be jurisdictional. The delivery by personal service or mailing referred to in this subsection may be made upon the party’s attorney of record in the proceeding before the agency. A mailing shall be addressed to the parties or their attorney of record at their last known mailing address. Proof of mailing shall be by affidavit. Any party of record in a contested case before an agency wishing to intervene and participate in the review proceeding must file an appearance within forty-five days from the time the petition is filed.\n\n3. If a party files an application under section 17A.16, subsection 2, for rehearing with the agency, the petition for judicial review must be filed within thirty days after that application has been denied or deemed denied. If a party does not file an application under section 17A.16, subsection 2, for rehearing, the petition must be filed within thirty days after the issuance of the agency’s final decision in that contested case. If an application for rehearing is granted, the petition for review must be filed within thirty days after the issuance of the agency’s final decision on rehearing. In cases involving a petition for judicial review of agency action other than the decision in a contested case, the petition may be filed at any time petitioner is aggrieved or adversely affected by that action.\n\n4. The petition for review shall name the agency as respondent and shall contain a concise statement of:\n\na. The nature of the agency action which is the subject of the petition.\n\nb. The particular agency action appealed from.\n\nc. The facts on which venue is based.\n\nd. The grounds on which relief is sought.\n\ne. The relief sought.\n\n5. a. The filing of the petition for review does not itself stay execution or enforcement of any agency action. Unless precluded by law, the agency may grant a stay on appropriate terms or other temporary remedies during the pendency of judicial review.\n\nb. A party may file an interlocutory motion in the reviewing court, during the pendency of judicial review, seeking review of the agency’s action on an application for stay or other temporary remedies.\n\nc. If the agency refuses to grant an application for stay or other temporary remedies, or application to the agency for a stay or other temporary remedies is an inadequate remedy, the court may grant relief but only after a consideration and balancing of all of the following factors:\n\n(1) The extent to which the applicant is likely to prevail when the court finally disposes of the matter.\n\n(2) The extent to which the applicant will suffer irreparable injury if relief is not granted.\n\n(3) The extent to which the grant of relief to the applicant will substantially harm other parties to the proceedings.\n\n(4) The extent to which the public interest relied on by the agency is sufficient to justify the agency’s action in the circumstances.\n\nd. If the court determines that relief should be granted from the agency’s action on an application for stay or other temporary remedies, the court may remand the matter to the agency with directions to deny a stay, to grant a stay on appropriate terms, or to grant other temporary remedies, or the court may issue an order denying a stay, granting a stay on appropriate terms, or granting other temporary remedies.\n\n6. Within thirty days after filing of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of any contested case which may be the subject of the petition. By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record of such a case may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.\n\n7. In proceedings for judicial review of agency action a court may hear and consider such evidence as it deems appropriate. In proceedings for judicial review of agency action in a contested case, however, a court shall not itself hear any further evidence with respect to those issues of fact whose determination was entrusted by the Constitution or a statute to the agency in that contested case proceeding. Before the date set for hearing a petition for judicial review of agency action in a contested case, application may be made to the court for leave to present evidence in addition to that found in the record of the case. If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the contested case proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision in the case by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court and mail copies of the new findings or decisions to all parties.\n\n8. Except to the extent that this chapter provides otherwise, in suits for judicial review of agency action all of the following apply:\n\na. The burden of demonstrating the required prejudice and the invalidity of agency action is on the party asserting invalidity.\n\nb. The validity of agency action must be determined in accordance with the standards of review provided in this section, as applied to the agency action at the time that action was taken.\n\n9. The court shall make a separate and distinct ruling on each material issue on which the court’s decision is based.\n\n10. The court may affirm the agency action or remand to the agency for further proceedings. The court shall reverse, modify, or grant other appropriate relief from agency action, equitable or legal and including declaratory relief, if it determines that substantial rights of the person seeking judicial relief have been prejudiced because the agency action is any of the following:\n\na. Unconstitutional on its face or as applied or is based upon a provision of law that is unconstitutional on its face or as applied.\n\nb. Beyond the authority delegated to the agency by any provision of law or in violation of any provision of law.\n\nc. Based upon an erroneous interpretation of a provision of law whose interpretation has not clearly been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\nd. Based upon a procedure or decision-making process prohibited by law or was taken without following the prescribed procedure or decision-making process.\n\ne. The product of decision making undertaken by persons who were improperly constituted as a decision-making body, were motivated by an improper purpose, or were subject to disqualification.\n\nf. Based upon a determination of fact clearly vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency that is not supported by substantial evidence in the record before the court when that record is viewed as a whole. For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\n(1) “Substantial evidence” means the quantity and quality of evidence that would be deemed sufficient by a neutral, detached, and reasonable person, to establish the fact at issue when the consequences resulting from the establishment of that fact are understood to be serious and of great importance.\n\n(2) “Record before the court” means the agency record for judicial review, as defined by this chapter, supplemented by any additional evidence received by the court under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(3) “When that record is viewed as a whole” means that the adequacy of the evidence in the record before the court to support a particular finding of fact must be judged in light of all the relevant evidence in the record cited by any party that detracts from that finding as well as all of the relevant evidence in the record cited by any party that supports it, including any determinations of veracity by the presiding officer who personally observed the demeanor of the witnesses and the agency’s explanation of why the relevant evidence in the record supports its material findings of fact.\n\ng. Action other than a rule that is inconsistent with a rule of the agency.\n\nh. Action other than a rule that is inconsistent with the agency’s prior practice or precedents, unless the agency has justified that inconsistency by stating credible reasons sufficient to indicate a fair and rational basis for the inconsistency.\n\ni. The product of reasoning that is so illogical as to render it wholly irrational.\n\nj. The product of a decision-making process in which the agency did not consider a relevant and important matter relating to the propriety or desirability of the action in question that a rational decision maker in similar circumstances would have considered prior to taking that action.\n\nk. Not required by law and its negative impact on the private rights affected is so grossly disproportionate to the benefits accruing to the public interest from that action that it must necessarily be deemed to lack any foundation in rational agency policy.\n\nl. Based upon an irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation of a provision of law whose interpretation has clearly been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\nm. Based upon an irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable application of law to fact that has clearly been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\nn. Otherwise unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\n\n11. In making the determinations required by subsection 10, paragraphs “a” through “n”, the court shall do all of the following:\n\na. Shall not give any deference to the view of the agency with respect to whether particular matters have been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\nb. Should not give any deference to the view of the agency with respect to particular matters that have not been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\nc. Shall give appropriate deference to the view of the agency with respect to particular matters that have been vested by a provision of law in the discretion of the agency.\n\n12. A defendant in a suit for civil enforcement of agency action may defend on any of the grounds specified in subsection 10, paragraphs “a” through “n”, if that defendant, at the time the enforcement suit was filed, would have been entitled to rely upon any of those grounds as a basis for invalidating the agency action in a suit for judicial review of that action brought at the time the enforcement suit was filed. If a suit for civil enforcement of agency action in a contested case is filed within the time period in which the defendant could have filed a petition for judicial review of that agency action, and the agency subsequently dismisses its suit for civil enforcement of that agency action against the defendant, the defendant may, within thirty days of that dismissal, file a petition for judicial review of the original agency action at issue if the defendant relied upon any of the grounds for judicial review in subsection 10, paragraphs “a” through “n”, in a responsive pleading to the enforcement action, or if the time to file a responsive pleading had not yet expired at the time the enforcement action was dismissed.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §17A.19; 81 Acts, ch 24, §1, 2]\n\n98 Acts, ch 1202, §22 – 24, 46; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §12\n\nReferred to in §10A.322, 10A.330, 10A.601, 10A.720, 21.6, 22.8, 22.10, 23.5, 23.10, 80A.17, 90A.11, 92.22, 99A.6, 103.29, 103.31, 103.39, 105.27, 139A.22, 152C.4, 156.16, 157.13, 169.15, 185.34, 214A.11, 216.17, 225C.29, 225C.61, 252.27, 261B.3, 272C.3, 272C.6, 321.52, 321.560, 368.22, 441.37B, 455I.9, 476.6, 514G.110, 514J.110, 522B.11, 522D.7, 533A.16, 535B.13, 535D.13, 542.14, 542B.27, 543D.21, 543E.18, 544A.15",
