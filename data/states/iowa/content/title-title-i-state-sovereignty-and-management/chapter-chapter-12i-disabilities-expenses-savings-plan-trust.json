The general assembly finds that the general welfare and well-being of the state are directly related to the health, maintenance, independence, and quality of life of its disabled residents, and that a vital and valid public purpose is served by the creation and implementation of programs that encourage and make possible savings to secure funding for disability-related expenses on behalf of individuals with disabilities that will supplement, but not supplant, other benefits provided by various federal, state, and private sources. The creation of the means of encouragement for citizens to invest in such a program represents the carrying out of a vital and valid public purpose. In order to make available to the citizens of the state an opportunity to fund future disability-related expenses of individuals, it is necessary that a public trust be established in which moneys may be invested for payment of future disability-related expenses of an individual.\n\n2. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Account balance limit” means the maximum allowable aggregate balance of an account established for a designated beneficiary. Account earnings, if any, are included in the account balance limit.\n\nb. “Account owner” means an individual who is the designated beneficiary under a participation agreement under this chapter for the payment of qualified disability expenses on behalf of the designated beneficiary.\n\nc. “Contracting state” means the same as defined in section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nd. “Designated beneficiary” means an individual who is a resident of this state or a resident of a contracting state and who meets the definition of “eligible individual” in section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\ne. “Internal Revenue Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\nf. “Iowa ABLE savings plan trust” or “trust” means the trust created under section 12I.2.\n\ng. “Participation agreement” means an agreement establishing an account with the trust.\n\nh. “Qualified ABLE program” means the same as defined in section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\ni. “Qualified disability expenses” means the same as defined in section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nj. “Resident” shall be defined by rules adopted by the treasurer of state. The rules shall determine residency in such manner as may be required or permitted under section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code, or, in the absence of any guidance under federal law, as the treasurer of state deems advisable for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n2015 Acts, ch 137, §76, 162, 163; 2021 Acts, ch 136, §1\n\nReferred to in §12D.1, 12I.10, 249A.53, 633C.2, 634A.2",

The general assembly acknowledges that section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code permits access to qualified ABLE programs by residents of a state without such a program. The general assembly finds that becoming a contracting state may accomplish the public purpose set forth in section 12I.1, subsection 1, in the same manner as if the qualified ABLE program under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust were to be implemented and administered by this state. To that end, the treasurer of state, as trustee of the trust, may defer implementation of the qualified ABLE program under the trust and alternatively cause this state to become a contracting state by entering into an agreement with another state with a qualified ABLE program to provide Iowa residents access to that state’s qualified ABLE program. The trust shall not enter into an agreement pursuant to this section unless the treasurer, as trustee of the trust, determines that all of the following requirements are satisfied:\n\na. The program is a qualified ABLE program.\n\nb. The qualified ABLE program provides comparable benefits and protections to Iowa residents as would be provided under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.\n\nc. That entering into an agreement for access to the qualified ABLE program would not result in increased costs to the state or to account owners and designated beneficiaries as compared to the costs of implementing and administering the qualified ABLE program under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.\n\nd. The qualified ABLE program will be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant or by the state auditor, or similar public official, of the state that has implemented the qualified ABLE program.\n\ne. The qualified ABLE program will provide information to the treasurer of state as trustee of the trust so as to allow the trustee to fulfill the reporting requirements in section 12I.7.\n\n2. a. The maximum amount that may be deducted per year for Iowa income tax purposes by an individual for contributions on behalf of any one designated beneficiary that is a resident of this state to the qualified ABLE program with which the state has contracted pursuant to this section shall not exceed the maximum deductible amount determined for the year pursuant to section 12D.3, subsection 1.\n\nb. State income tax treatment of the qualified ABLE program with which the state has contracted pursuant to this section shall be as provided in section 422.7, subsections 24 and 25.\n\n3.
