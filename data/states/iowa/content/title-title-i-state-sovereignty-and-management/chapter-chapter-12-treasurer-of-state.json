      "text": "12.28 Centralized financing for state agency purchase of real and personal property.\n\n1. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Financing agreement” means any lease, lease-purchase agreement, or installment acquisition contract in which the lessee may purchase the leased property at a price which is less than the fair market value of the property at the end of the lease term, or any lease, agreement, or transaction which would be considered under criteria established by the internal revenue service to be a conditional sale agreement for tax purposes.\n\nb. “State agency” means a board, commission, bureau, division, office, department, or branch of state government. However, state agency does not mean the state board of regents, institutions governed by the board of regents, or authorities created under chapter 16 or 261A.\n\n2. The treasurer of state shall have sole authority to enter into financing agreements on behalf of state agencies. The treasurer of state may enter into financing agreements, including master lease-purchase agreements, for the purpose of funding state agency requests for the financing of real or personal property, wherever located within the state, including equipment, buildings, facilities, and structures, or additions or improvements to existing buildings, facilities, and structures. Subject to the selection procedures of section 12.30, the treasurer may employ financial consultants, banks, trustees, insurers, underwriters, accountants, attorneys, and other advisors or consultants as necessary to implement the provisions of this section. The costs of professional services and any other costs of entering into the financing agreements may be included in the financing agreement as a cost of the property being financed.\n\n3. The financing agreement may provide for ultimate ownership of the property by the state. Title to all property acquired in this manner shall be taken and held in the name of the state. The state shall be the lessee or contracting party under all financing agreements entered into pursuant to this section. The financing agreements may contain provisions pertaining, but not limited to, interest, term, prepayment, and the state’s obligation to make payments on the financing agreement beyond the current budget year subject to availability of appropriations. All projects financed under this section shall be deemed to be for an essential governmental purpose.\n\n4. The treasurer of state may contract for additional security or liquidity for a financing agreement and may enter into agreements for letters of credit, lines of credit, insurance, or other forms of security with respect to rental and other payments due under a financing agreement. Fees for the costs of additional security or liquidity are a cost of entering into the financing agreement and may be paid from funds annually appropriated by the general assembly to the state agency for which the property is being obtained, from other funds legally available, or from proceeds of the financing agreement. The provision of a financing agreement which provides that a portion of the periodic rental or lease payment be applied as interest is subject to chapter 74A. Other laws relating to interest rates do not apply. Chapter 75 does not apply to financing agreements entered into pursuant to this section.\n\n5. Payments and other costs due under financing agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall be payable from funds annually appropriated by the general assembly to the state agency for which the property is being obtained or from other funds legally available. The treasurer of state, in cooperation with the department of administrative services, shall implement procedures to ensure that state agencies are timely in making payments due under the financing agreements.\n\n6. The maximum principal amount of financing agreements which the treasurer of state can enter into shall be one million dollars per state agency in a fiscal year, subject to the requirements of section 8.46. For the fiscal year, the treasurer of state shall not enter into more than one million dollars of financing agreements per state agency, not considering interest expense. However, the treasurer of state may enter into financing agreements in excess of the one million dollar per agency per fiscal year limit if a constitutional majority of each house of the general assembly, or the legislative council if the general assembly is not in session, and the governor, authorize the treasurer of state to enter into additional financing agreements above the one million dollar authorization contained in this section. The treasurer of state shall not enter into a financing agreement for real or personal property which is to be constructed for use as a prison or prison-related facility without prior authorization by a constitutional majority of each house of the general assembly and approval by the governor of the use, location, and maximum cost, not including interest expense, of the real or personal property to be financed. However, financing agreements for an energy conservation measure, as defined in section 7D.34, for an energy management improvement, as defined in section 473.19, or for costs associated with projects under section 473.13A, are exempt from the provisions of this subsection, but are subject to the requirements of section 7D.34. In addition, financing agreements funded through the materials and equipment revolving fund established in section 307.47 are exempt from the provisions of this subsection.\n\n7. The treasurer of state shall decide upon the most economical method of financing a state agency’s request for funds. The treasurer of state may utilize master lease-purchase agreements, issue certificates of participation in lease-purchase agreements, or use any other financing method or method of sale which the treasurer believes will provide savings to the state in issuance or interest costs.\n\n8. A financing agreement to which the state is a party is an obligation of the state for purposes of chapters 502 and 636, and is a lawful investment for banks, trust companies, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, executors, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries responsible for the investment of funds.\n\n9. Publication of any notice, whether under section 73A.12 or otherwise, and other or further proceedings with respect to the financing agreements referred to in this section are not required except as set forth in this section, notwithstanding any provisions of other statutes of the state to the contrary.\n\n96 Acts, ch 1177, §2; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2008 Acts, ch 1126, §2, 33; 2008 Acts, ch 1156, §13, 58; 2009 Acts, ch 97, §6; 2013 Acts, ch 100, §19, 27; 2023 Acts, ch 70, §16\n\nReferred to in §8A.321, 8D.11, 29C.23, 473.19, 473.20A, 476.10B\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph b amended",

Loan applications for the transfer of an existing small business shall be to assist in the transfer of ownership of a retail, wholesale, manufacturing, service, or agricultural business that may close in the absence of sufficient financial assistance.\n\n3. During the lifetime of this loan program, the maximum amount of assistance that an eligible borrower or business may borrow or receive through this loan program shall be two hundred thousand dollars. An eligible borrower or business under this program shall be limited to one loan from one financial institution.\n\n4.

Liquor, beer, and wine sales must not exceed twenty percent of annual sales for establishments holding a class “C” retail alcohol license issued pursuant to section 123.30.\n\nf. If an application involves the transfer of an existing small business, the transfer must be by purchase, lease-purchase, or contract of sale. The purchase must be for all or a portion of the business which is essential to its continued viability, including land where the business is located, fixtures attached to the land, machinery, inventory, supplies, equipment, information technology, or licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property relied upon by the business, and inventory for sale by the business.\n\n6.

Any amounts remaining in the school infrastructure fund at the end of the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, and for each fiscal year thereafter, which are determined by the treasurer of state to be unencumbered and unobligated and otherwise unnecessary to make the payments for such fiscal year, shall be transferred to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund created in section 8.57.\n\n5. a. The treasurer of state may create and establish one or more special funds, to be known as “bond reserve funds”, to secure one or more issues of bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 12.81. The treasurer of state shall pay into each bond reserve fund any moneys appropriated and made available by the state or the treasurer for the purpose of the fund, any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds to the extent provided in the resolutions authorizing their issuance, and any other moneys which may be available to the treasurer for the purpose of the fund from any other sources. All moneys held in a bond reserve fund, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall be used as required solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured in whole or in part by the fund or of the sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds, the purchase or redemption of the bonds, the payment of interest on the bonds, or the payments of any redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed prior to maturity.\n\nb. Moneys in a bond reserve fund shall not be withdrawn from it at any time in an amount that will reduce the amount of the fund to less than the bond reserve fund requirement established for the fund, as provided in this subsection, except for the purpose of making, with respect to bonds secured in whole or in part by the fund, payment when due of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and the sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds for the payment of which other moneys of the treasurer are not available. Any income or interest earned by, or incremental to, a bond reserve fund due to the investment of it may be transferred by the treasurer to other funds or accounts to the extent the transfer does not reduce the amount of that bond reserve fund below the bond reserve fund requirement for it.\n\nc. The treasurer of state shall not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a bond reserve fund if, upon the issuance of the bonds, the amount in the bond reserve fund will be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for the fund, unless the treasurer at the time of issuance of the bonds deposits in the fund from the proceeds of the bonds issued or from other sources an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for the fund. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “bond reserve fund requirement” means, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money, as provided in the resolutions authorizing the bonds with respect to which the fund is established.\n\nd. To assure the continued solvency of any bonds secured by the bond reserve fund, provision is made in paragraph “c” for the accumulation in each bond reserve fund of an amount equal to the bond reserve fund requirement for the fund. In order further to assure maintenance of the bond reserve funds, the treasurer shall, on or before January 1 of each calendar year, make and deliver to the governor the treasurer’s certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore each bond reserve fund to the bond reserve fund requirement for that fund. Within thirty days after the beginning of the session of the general assembly next following the delivery of the certificate, the governor shall submit to both houses printed copies of a budget including the sum, if any, required to restore each bond reserve fund to the bond reserve fund requirement for that fund. Any sums appropriated by the general assembly and paid to the treasurer pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited by the treasurer in the applicable bond reserve fund.\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1174, §22\n\n; 2001 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 5, §4, 7\n\n; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §4; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §12\n\n; 2011 Acts, ch 133, §24, 25, 29\n\n; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §1\n\nReferred to in §8.57, 8.57F, 12.85, 12.86, 292.1",
