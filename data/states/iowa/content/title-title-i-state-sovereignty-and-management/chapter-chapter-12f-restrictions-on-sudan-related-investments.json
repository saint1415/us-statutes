Therefore, the general assembly intends that state funds and funds administered by the state, including public employee retirement funds, should not be invested in companies that provide power production-related services, mineral extraction activities, oil-related activities, or military equipment to the government of Sudan, or are complicit in the genocide in Darfur, given the ongoing genocide in that country, the previous atrocities perpetrated by the government of Sudan, and the abysmal human rights situation in that country.\n\n2007 Acts, ch 39, §1",

By July 1, 2007, the public fund shall make its best efforts to identify all scrutinized companies in which the public fund has direct or indirect holdings or could possibly have such holdings in the future and shall create and make available to the public a scrutinized companies list for that public fund. The list shall further identify whether the company has inactive business operations or active business operations. The public fund shall review and update, if necessary, the scrutinized companies list and the determination of whether a company has inactive or active business operations on an annual basis thereafter.\n\nb. In making its best efforts to identify scrutinized companies and companies with inactive business operations or active business operations, the public fund may review and rely, in the best judgment of the public fund, on publicly available information regarding companies with business operations in Sudan, such as information provided by the Sudan divestment task force, and including other information that may be provided by nonprofit organizations, research firms, international organizations, and government entities. The public fund may also contact asset managers and institutional investors for the public fund to identify scrutinized companies based upon industry-recognized lists of such companies that the public fund may have indirect holdings in.\n\n2. a. For each company on the scrutinized companies list with only inactive business operations in which the public fund has direct or indirect holdings, the public fund shall send a written notice informing the company of the requirements of this chapter and encouraging it to continue to refrain from initiating active business operations in Sudan until it is able to avoid scrutinized business operations. The public fund shall continue to provide such written notice on an annual basis if the company remains a scrutinized company with inactive business operations.\n\nb. For each company on the scrutinized companies list with active business operations in which the public fund has direct or indirect holdings, the public fund shall send a written notice informing the company of its status as a scrutinized company with active business operations and that it may become subject to divestment and restrictions on investing in the company by the public fund. The notice shall offer the company the opportunity to clarify its Sudan-related activities and shall encourage the company to either cease its scrutinized business operations or convert such operations to inactive business operations in order to avoid becoming subject to divestment and restrictions on investment in the company by the public fund.
