An individual may claim the credit of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata share of the individual’s earnings from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust. Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer’s tax liability for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the following seven years, or until depleted, whichever is earlier.\n\n2. The board shall certify the maximum amount of a tax credit which could be issued to a designated investor and identify the specific earliest date or dates the certificate may be redeemed pursuant to this subchapter. The amount of the tax credit shall be limited to an amount equivalent to any difference between the scheduled aggregate return to the designated investor at rates of return authorized by the board and aggregate actual return received by the designated investor and any predecessor in interest of capital and interest on the capital. The rates, whether fixed rates or variable rates, shall be determined pursuant to a formula stipulated in the certificate or incorporated therein by reference. The board shall clearly indicate on the certificate, or incorporate therein by reference, the schedule, the amount of equity investment, the calculation formula for determining the scheduled aggregate return on invested capital, and the calculation formula for determining the amount of the tax credit that may be claimed. Once issued to a designated investor, a certificate shall be binding on the board and the department of revenue and shall not be modified, terminated, or rescinded.\n\n3. If a designated investor or transferee elects to redeem a certificate, the certificate shall not be redeemed prior to the maturity date or dates stated on the certificate. At the time of redemption, the board shall determine the amount of the tax credit that may be claimed by the designated investor based upon the returns received by the designated investor and its predecessors in interest and the provisions of the certificate. The board shall issue a verification to the department of revenue setting forth the maximum tax credit which can be claimed by the designated investor with respect to the redemption of the certificate.\n\n4. The board shall, in conjunction with the department of revenue, develop a system for registration of any certificate and related tax credit issued or transferred pursuant to this section and a system that permits verification that any tax credit claimed upon a tax return is valid and that any transfers of the certificate and related tax credit are made in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.\n\n5. The board shall issue the tax credits in such a manner that not more than twenty million dollars of tax credits may be initially redeemable in any fiscal year. The board shall indicate on the tax certificate the principal amount of the tax credit and the maturity date or dates on which the credit may be first claimed.\n\n6. A certificate or tax credit issued or transferred pursuant to this subchapter shall not be considered a security pursuant to chapter 502.\n\n7. In determining the maximum aggregate limit in subsection 1 and the fiscal year limitation in subsection 5, the board shall use the cumulative amount of scheduled aggregate returns on certificates issued by the board to designated investors. However, certificates and related tax credits which have expired shall not be included and certificates and related tax credits which have been redeemed shall be included only to the extent of tax credits actually allowed.\n\n2002 Acts, ch 1005, §6; 2002 Acts, ch 1006, §13, 14; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2005 Acts, ch 7, §3, 4; 2010 Acts, ch 1138, §20, 21; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §76\n\nReferred to in §15E.62, 15E.63, 422.11Q, 422.33, 422.60, 432.12I, 533.329",
