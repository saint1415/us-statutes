If a public fund determines that a company may be subject to inclusion on the prohibited companies list, the public fund shall scrutinize and engage the company for a period of not more than twelve months and shall include the company on the prohibited companies list if the public fund determines that the company is a prohibited company.\n\n2023 Acts, ch 58, §5\n\nReferred to in §12K.4, 12K.6\n\nNEW section",
