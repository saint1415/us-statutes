      "text": "6B.54 Acquisition policies for acquiring agencies.\n\nFor any public use, public purpose, or public improvement for which condemnation is sought, an acquiring agency shall, at a minimum, satisfy the following policies:\n\n1. Every reasonable and good faith effort shall be made to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation as provided in section 6B.2B.\n\n2. Real property shall be appraised as required by section 6B.45 before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or the owner’s designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany at least one appraiser of the acquiring agency during an inspection of the property, except that an acquiring agency may prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition of property with a low fair market value. In lieu of an appraisal, a utility or person under the jurisdiction of the utilities board, or any other utility conferred the right by statute to condemn private property, shall provide in writing by certified mail to the owner of record thirty days before negotiations, the methods and factors used in arriving at an offered price for voluntary easements including the range of cash amount of each component.\n\n3. Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, the acquiring agency shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation for the real property, and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount established by the agency. In no event shall the amount be less than the fair market value the acquiring agency has established for the property or property interest pursuant to the appraisal required in section 6B.45 or less than the value determined under the acquiring agency’s waiver procedure established pursuant to subsection 2. A purchase offer made by an acquiring agency shall include provisions for payment to the owner of expenses, including relocation expenses, expenses listed in subsection 10, and other expenses required by law to be paid by an acquiring agency to a condemnee. However, in the alternative, the acquiring agency may make, and the owner may accept, a purchase offer from the acquiring agency that is an amount equal to one hundred thirty percent of the appraisal amount plus payment to the owner of expenses listed in subsection 10, once those expenses have been determined. If the owner accepts such a purchase offer, the owner is barred from claiming payment from the acquiring agency for any other expenses allowed by law. In the case of a utility or person under the jurisdiction of the utilities board, or any other utility conferred the right by statute to condemn private property, the amount shall not be less than the amount indicated by the methods and factors used in arriving at an offered price for a voluntary easement. The option to make an alternative purchase offer does not apply when property is being acquired for street and highway projects undertaken by the state, a county, or a city.\n\n4. The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move the person’s business or farm operation without at least ninety days’ written notice of the date by which the move is required.\n\n5. If after damages have been finally determined and paid, an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.\n\n6. In no event shall the time of condemnation be advanced, or negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, or any other coercive action be taken to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.\n\n7. If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted. The acquiring agency shall not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the owner’s real property.\n\n8. If the acquisition of only a portion of property would leave the owner with an uneconomical remnant, the acquiring agency shall offer to acquire that remnant. For the purposes of this chapter, an “uneconomical remnant” is a parcel of real property in which the owner is left with an interest after the partial acquisition of the owner’s property, where the acquiring agency determines that the parcel has little or no value or utility to the owner.\n\n9. A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this chapter, after the person has been fully informed of the person’s right to receive just compensation for the property, may donate the property, any part of the property, any interest in the property, or any compensation paid for it as the person may determine.\n\n10. a. As soon as practicable after the date of payment of the purchase price or the date of deposit in court of funds to satisfy the award of compensation in a condemnation proceeding to acquire real property, whichever is earlier, the acquiring agency shall reimburse the owner, to the extent the acquiring agency deems fair and reasonable, for expenses the owner necessarily incurred for all of the following:\n\n(1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental to conveying the real property to the acquiring agency.\n\n(2) Penalty costs for full or partial prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering the real property.\n\nb. Payments and expenditures under this subsection are incident to and arise out of the program or project for which the acquisition activity takes place. Such payments and expenditures may be made from the funds made available for the program or project.\n\nc. A person aggrieved by a determination as to the eligibility for or amount of a reimbursement may apply to have the matter reviewed by the acquiring agency or in accordance with section 316.9 if applicable.\n\n11. An owner shall not be required to surrender possession of real property before the acquiring agency concerned pays the agreed purchase price.\n\n12. After damages have been finally determined and paid, the acquiring agency may offer, and the owner may accept, an amount equal to thirty percent of the amount of damages plus payment to the owner of expenses listed in subsection 10, once those expenses have been determined. If the owner accepts such an offer, the owner is barred from claiming payment from the acquiring agency for any other expenses allowed by law. This subsection does not apply when property is being acquired for street and highway projects undertaken by the state, a county, or a city.\n\n89 Acts, ch 20, §19\n\nCS89, §472.54\n\nC93, §6B.54\n\n99 Acts, ch 171, §19, 20, 42;\n\n2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §18, 49\n\n; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §2656\n\nReferred to in §6B.2B\n\nSubsections 2 and 3 amended",

If an interest in real property is acquired, the acquiring agency shall acquire an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property which are required to be removed from the real property or which are determined to be adversely affected by the use to which the real property will be put.\n\n2. For the purpose of determining the just compensation to be paid for any building, structure, or other improvement required to be acquired under this section, the building, structure, or other improvement shall be deemed to be a part of the real property to be acquired, notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant of the lands, as against the owner of any other interest in the real property, to remove the building, structure, or improvement at the expiration of the tenant’s term. The fair market value which the building, structure, or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the real property to be acquired, or the fair market value of the building, structure, or improvement for removal from the real property, whichever is the greater, shall be paid to the owner of the building, structure, or improvement.\n\n3. Payment for the building, structure, or improvement under this section shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by state law. The payment shall not be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release all the tenant’s right, title, and interest in and to the improvements. Nothing with regard to the above-mentioned acquisition of buildings, structures, or other improvements shall be construed to deprive the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for the property interests in accordance with other laws of this state.\n\n89 Acts, ch 20, §20\n\nCS89, §472.55\n\nC93, §6B.55\n\n99 Acts, ch 171, §21, 42;\n\n2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §19, 49",

If all or a portion of real property condemned pursuant to this chapter is not used for the purpose stated in the application filed pursuant to section 6B.3 and the acquiring agency seeks to dispose of the unused real property, the acquiring agency shall first offer the unused real property for sale to the prior owner of the condemned property as provided in this section. If real property condemned pursuant to this chapter is used for the purpose stated in the application filed pursuant to section 6B.3 and the acquiring agency seeks to dispose of the real property by sale to a private person or entity within five years after acquisition of the property, the acquiring agency shall first offer the property for sale to the prior owner of the condemned property as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, the prior owner of the real property includes the successor in interest of the real property.\n\n2. a. Before the real property described in subsection 1 may be offered for sale to the general public, the acquiring agency shall notify the prior owner of such real property in writing of the acquiring agency’s intent to dispose of the real property, of the current appraised value of the real property to be offered for sale, and of the prior owner’s right to purchase the real property to be offered for sale within sixty days from the date the notice is served at a price equal to the current appraised value of the real property to be offered for sale or the fair market value of the property to be offered for sale at the time it was acquired by the acquiring agency from the prior owner plus cleanup costs incurred by the acquiring agency for the property to be offered for sale, whichever is less. However, the current appraised value of the real property to be offered for sale shall be the purchase price to be paid by the previous owner if any other amount would result in a loss of federal funding for projects funded in whole or in part with federal funds. The notice sent by the acquiring agency as provided in this subsection shall be filed with the office of the recorder in the county in which the real property is located.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, “cleanup costs” means costs incurred to abate a nuisance or a public nuisance as those terms are defined in chapters 657 and 657A and costs incurred to recycle and remediate land pursuant to chapter 455H.\n\n3. If the prior owner elects to purchase the real property at the price established in subsection 2, before the expiration of the sixty-day period, the prior owner shall notify the acquiring agency in writing of this intention and file a copy of this notice with the office of the recorder in the county in which the real property is located.\n\n4.

When five years have elapsed since property was condemned and all or a portion of the property has not been used for the purpose stated in the application filed pursuant to section 6B.3, and the acquiring agency has not taken action to dispose of the unused property pursuant to section 6B.56, the acquiring agency shall, within sixty days, adopt a resolution reaffirming the purpose for which the unused property will be used or offering the unused property for sale to the prior owner at a price as provided in section 6B.56. However, if all or a portion of such property was condemned for the creation of a lake subject to the requirements of section 6A.22, subsection 2, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (b), the acquiring agency shall not adopt a resolution reaffirming the purpose for which the property was to be used and shall instead adopt a resolution offering the property for sale to the prior owner at a price as provided in section 6B.56. If the resolution adopted approves an offer of sale to the prior owner, the offer shall be made in writing and mailed by certified mail to the prior owner.
