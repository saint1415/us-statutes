The board of supervisors of each county shall maintain a joint 911 service board.\n\n(1) Each political subdivision of the state having a public safety agency serving territory within the county and each local emergency management agency as defined in section 29C.2 operating within the area is entitled to voting membership on the joint 911 service board. For the purposes of this section, a township that operates a volunteer fire department providing fire protection services to the township, or a city which provides fire protection services through the operation of a volunteer fire department not financed through city government, shall be considered a political subdivision of the state having a public safety agency serving territory within the county. Each private safety agency operating within the area is entitled to nonvoting membership on the board.\n\n(2) A township that does not operate its own public safety agency, but contracts for the provision of public safety services, is not entitled to membership on the joint 911 service board, but its contractor is entitled to membership according to the contractor’s status as a public or private safety agency.\n\n(3) The sheriff of each county, or the sheriff’s designee, is entitled to voting membership on the joint 911 service board.\n\n(4) The chief of police of each city operating a public safety answering point, or the chief of police’s designee, is entitled to voting membership on the joint 911 service board of the county where the city is located.\n\nb. The joint 911 service board shall maintain a 911 service plan encompassing at minimum the entire county, unless an exemption is granted by the program manager permitting a smaller 911 service area.\n\n(1) The program manager may grant a discretionary exemption from the single county minimum service area requirement based upon a joint 911 service board’s or other 911 service plan operating authority’s presentation of evidence which supports the requested exemption if the program manager finds that local conditions make adherence to the minimum standard unreasonable or technically infeasible and that the purposes of this chapter would be furthered by granting an exemption. The minimum size requirement is intended to prevent unnecessary duplication of public safety answering points and minimize other administrative, personnel, and equipment expenses.\n\n(2) The program manager may order the inclusion of a specific territory not serviced by surrounding 911 service plan areas in an adjoining 911 service plan area upon request of the joint 911 service board representing the territory to avoid the creation by exclusion of a territory smaller than a single county.\n\nc. The 911 service plan operating authority shall submit proposed changes to the plan to all of the following:\n\n(1) The program manager.\n\n(2) Public and private safety agencies in the 911 service area.\n\n(3) Local exchange service providers affected by the 911 service plan.\n\n2. Compliance waivers available in limited circumstances.\n\na. The program manager may extend the time period for plan implementation by issuing a compliance waiver.\n\nb. The compliance waiver shall be based upon a joint 911 service board’s presentation of evidence which supports an extension if the program manager finds that local conditions make implementation financially unreasonable or technically infeasible by the originally scheduled plan of implementation.\n\nc. The compliance waiver shall be for a set period of time, and subject to review and renewal or denial of renewal upon its expiration.\n\nd. The waiver may cover all or a portion of a 911 service plan’s 911 service area to facilitate phased implementation when possible.\n\ne. The granting of a compliance waiver does not create a presumption that the identical or similar waiver will be extended in the future.\n\nf. Consideration of compliance waivers shall be on a case-by-case basis.\n\n3. Chapter 28E agreement — alternative to joint 911 service board.\n\na. A legal entity created pursuant to chapter 28E by a county or counties, other political divisions, and public or private agencies to jointly plan, implement, and operate a countywide, or larger, 911 service system may be substituted for the joint 911 service board required under subsection 1. An alternative legal entity created pursuant to chapter 28E as a substitute for a joint 911 service board, as permitted by this subsection, may be created by either:\n\n(1) Agreement of the parties entitled to voting membership on a joint 911 service board.\n\n(2) Agreement of the members of a joint 911 service board.\n\nb. An alternative chapter 28E entity has all of the powers of a joint 911 service board and any additional powers granted by the agreement. As used in this chapter, “joint 911 service board” includes an alternative chapter 28E entity created for that purpose, except as specifically limited by the chapter 28E agreement or unless clearly provided otherwise in this chapter. A chapter 28E agreement related to 911 service shall permit the participation of a private safety agency or other persons allowed to participate in a joint 911 service board, but the terms, scope, and conditions of participation are subject to the chapter 28E agreement.\n\n4. Local emergency management commission — alternative to 911 service board.\n\na. Subject to section 29C.9, subsection 10, a local emergency management commission may be substituted for the joint 911 service board required under subsection 1 by the board of supervisors of the county in which the joint 911 service board is maintained.\n\nb. A commission shall have all of the powers of a joint 911 service board if a commission is substituted for the joint 911 service board pursuant to paragraph “a”.\n\nc. As used in this chapter, “joint 911 service board” includes a commission if a commission is substituted for the joint 911 service board pursuant to paragraph “a”.\n\n5.

Costs in excess of the amount raised by imposition of the 911 service surcharge provided for under subsection 1 shall be paid by the joint 911 service board from such revenue sources allocated among the member political subdivisions as determined by the joint 911 service board. Funding is not limited to the surcharge, and surcharge revenues may be supplemented by other permissible local and state revenue sources. A joint 911 service board shall not commit a political subdivision to appropriate property tax revenues to fund a 911 service plan without the consent of the political subdivision. A joint 911 service board may approve a 911 service plan, including a funding formula requiring appropriations by participating political subdivisions, subject to the approval of the funding formula by each political subdivision. However, a political subdivision may agree in advance to appropriate property tax revenues or other moneys according to a formula or plan developed by an alternative chapter 28E entity.\n\n1. Local wire-line 911 service surcharge imposition.\n\na. To encourage local implementation of 911 service, one source of funding for 911 emergency communication systems shall come from a surcharge per month, per access line on each access line subscriber, of one dollar.\n\nb. The surcharge shall be imposed by order of the program manager as follows:\n\n(1) The program manager shall notify a local exchange service provider scheduled to provide exchange access line service to a 911 service area that implementation of a 911 service plan has been approved by the joint 911 service board and that collection of the surcharge is to begin within sixty days.\n\n(2) The program manager shall also provide notice to all affected public safety answering points.\n\n2. Surcharge collected by local exchange service providers.\n\na. The surcharge shall be collected as part of the access line service provider’s periodic billing to a subscriber. In compensation for the costs of billing and collection, the local exchange service provider may retain one percent of the gross surcharges collected. If the compensation is insufficient to fully recover a local exchange service provider’s costs for billing and collection of the surcharge, the deficiency shall be included in the local exchange service provider’s costs for ratemaking purposes to the extent it is reasonable and just under section 476.6. The surcharge shall be remitted to the joint 911 service board for deposit into the 911 service fund quarterly by the local exchange service provider. The total amount for multiple exchanges may be combined.\n\nb. A local exchange service provider is not liable for an uncollected surcharge for which the local exchange service provider has billed a subscriber but not been paid. The surcharge shall appear as a single line item on a subscriber’s periodic billing entitled, “911 emergency communications service surcharge”.\n\nc. The joint 911 service board may request, not more than once each quarter, the following information from the local exchange service provider:\n\n(1) The identity of the exchange from which the surcharge is collected.\n\n(2) The number of lines to which the surcharge was applied for the quarter.\n\n(3) The number of refusals to pay per exchange if applicable.\n\n(4) Write-offs applied per exchange if applicable.\n\n(5) The number of lines exempt per exchange.\n\n(6) The amount retained by the local exchange service provider generated from the one percent administration fee.\n\nd. Access line counts and surcharge remittances are confidential public records as provided in section 34A.8.\n\n3. Maximum limit per subscriber billing for surcharge. An individual subscriber shall not be required to pay on a single periodic billing the surcharge on more than one hundred access lines, or their equivalent, in a 911 service area. A subscriber shall pay the surcharge in each 911 service area in which the subscriber receives access line service.\n\n4. 911 service fund. Each joint 911 service board shall establish and maintain as a separate account a 911 service fund. Any funds remaining in the account at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general funds of the member political subdivisions, except as provided in subsection 5, but shall remain in the 911 service fund. Moneys in a 911 service fund may only be used for nonrecurring and recurring costs of the 911 service plan as approved by the program manager, as those terms are defined by section 34A.2.\n\n5. Use of moneys in fund — priority and limitations on expenditure.\n\na. Moneys deposited in a 911 service fund shall be used for the repayment of any bonds issued for the benefit of or loan made to the joint 911 service board pursuant to sections 34A.20 through 34A.22, and as long as any such bond or loan remains unpaid the surcharge shall not be reduced or eliminated. Moneys deposited in the fund shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the relevant bond documents, trust indenture, resolution, loan agreement, or other instrument pursuant to which bonds are issued or a loan is made, without regard to any limitation otherwise provided by law.\n\nb. Moneys deposited in a 911 service fund shall be used for the following, in order of priority if paragraph “a” does not apply:\n\n(1) Money shall first be spent for actual recurring costs of operating the 911 service plan.\n\n(2) If money remains in the fund after fully paying for recurring costs incurred in the preceding year, the remainder may be spent to pay for nonrecurring costs, not to exceed actual nonrecurring costs as approved by the program manager.\n\n(3) If money remains in the fund after fully paying obligations under subparagraphs (1) and (2), the remainder may be accumulated in the fund as a carryover operating surplus.\n\n6. Limitation of liability — provider not liable on cause of action related to provision of 911 services. A claim or cause of action does not exist based upon or arising out of an act or omission in connection with a land-line or wireless provider’s participation in a 911 service plan or provision of 911 or local exchange access service, unless the act or omission is determined to be willful and wanton negligence.\n\n88 Acts, ch 1177, §7\n\nC89, §477B.7\n\n89 Acts, ch 168, §4 – 6; 90 Acts, ch 1144, §2 – 4\n\nC93, §34A.7\n\n98 Acts, ch 1101, §8, 16; 2004 Acts, ch 1175, §450 – 452; 2005 Acts, ch 140, §1; 2012 Acts, ch 1111, §5 – 8; 2013 Acts, ch 120, §1 – 4; 2017 Acts, ch 136, §8; 2018 Acts, ch 1076, §4, 11\n\nReferred to in §34A.2, 34A.7B, 476.95",

However, the moneys contained in such reserve account shall not exceed twelve and one-half percent of the total surcharges collected for each fiscal year. Moneys credited to the reserve account shall only be used by the department for the purpose of repairing or replacing equipment in the event of a catastrophic equipment failure, as determined by the director.\n\nf. (1) If moneys remain in the fund after fully paying all obligations under paragraphs “a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, and “e”, remaining funds shall be expended and distributed in the following priority order:\n\n(a) (i) The director, in consultation with the program manager and the 911 communications council, may provide grants to any public safety answering point agreeing to consolidate. For purposes of this subparagraph division, “consolidate” means the consolidation of all public safety answering point systems, functions, 911 service areas, and physical facilities of two or more public safety answering points, resulting in the consolidated public safety answering point being responsible for all call answering and dispatch functions for the combined 911 service area.

This subsection does not prohibit the inclusion of information in any report providing aggregate amounts and information which does not identify numbers of accounts or customers, revenues, or expenses attributable to an individual originating service provider.\n\n5. a. The program manager, in consultation with the 911 communications council and the auditor of state, shall establish a methodology for determining and collecting public safety answering point cost and expense data through the county joint 911 service boards. The methodology shall include the collection of data for direct costs and expenses related to the operation of a public safety answering point and account for the extent to which identified costs and expenses are compensated for or addressed through 911 surcharges versus other sources of funding.\n\nb. Data collection pursuant to paragraph “a” shall commence no later than January 1, 2014, and shall be subject to an audit by the auditor of state beginning July 1, 2014. The program manager shall prepare a report detailing the methodology developed and the data collected after such data has been collected for a two-year period. The report and the results of the initial audit shall be submitted to the general assembly by March 1, 2016. A new report regarding data collection and the results of an ongoing audit for each successive two-year period shall be submitted by March 1 every two years thereafter.

Remaining funds shall be held in the carryover operating surplus fund until the expenses and cost report is submitted by the county joint 911 service board. If the county joint 911 service board submits the expense and cost report before March 30 of the following year, the set aside funds shall be provided to the county joint 911 service board. If the county joint 911 service board fails to submit the expense and cost report within one year, funds shall revert to the carryover operating surplus fund and be used in accordance with subsection 2, paragraph “f”.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1101, §9, 16; 99 Acts, ch 96, §5; 2004 Acts, ch 1175, §453 – 455; 2005 Acts, ch 140, §2; 2007 Acts, ch 213, §21; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2009 Acts, ch 86, §4; 2012 Acts, ch 1111, §9; 2013 Acts, ch 29, §35, 36; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §13; 2013 Acts, ch 120, §5 – 8; 2015 Acts, ch 129, §3, 5, 7, 8; 2016 Acts, ch 1100, §1; 2016 Acts, ch 1103, §2 – 4; 2017 Acts, ch 136, §9; 2018 Acts, ch 1076, §5 – 8, 11; 2022 Acts, ch 1031, §1\n\nReferred to in §34A.2, 34A.7B, 34A.15",
