The lien attaches at the time the notice of the lien is filed under subsection 3, and continues for ten years from that date, unless released or otherwise discharged at an earlier time.\n\nb. The lien may be extended, within ten years from the date of attachment, if a person files a notice with the county recorder or other appropriate county official of the county in which the property is located at the time of filing the extension. From the time of the filing of the notice, the lien period shall be extended for ten years to apply to the property in the county in which the notice is filed, unless released or otherwise discharged at an earlier time. The number of extensions is not limited.\n\nc. The department shall discharge any lien which is allowed to lapse and may charge off any account and release the corresponding lien before the lien has lapsed if the department determines, under uniform rules prescribed by the director, that the account is uncollectible or collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due.\n\n3. To preserve the lien against subsequent mortgagees, purchasers, or judgment creditors, for value and without notice of the lien, on any property located in a county, the director shall file a notice of the lien with the recorder of the county in which the property is located at the time of filing of the notice.\n\n4. The county recorder of each county shall prepare and maintain in the recorder’s office an index of liens of debts established based upon benefits or provider payments inappropriately obtained from and owed the department of health and human services, containing the applicable entries specified in sections 558.49 and 558.52, and providing appropriate columns for all of the following data, under the names of debtors, arranged alphabetically:\n\na.

The distress warrant shall be in a form as prescribed by the director, shall be directed to the sheriff of the appropriate county, and shall identify the debtor, the type of debt, and the delinquent amount. The distress warrant shall direct the sheriff to distrain, seize, garnish, or levy upon, and sell, as provided by law, any real or personal property belonging to the debtor to satisfy the amount of the delinquency plus costs. The distress warrant shall also direct the sheriff to make due and prompt return to the department or to the district court under chapter 626 of all amounts collected.\n\n10.

One member shall be qualified by experience and affiliation to represent employers, one member shall be qualified by experience and affiliation to represent employees, and one member shall represent the general public.

The members of the employment appeal board shall receive an annual salary as set by the governor.\n\n3. The members of the appeal board shall select a chairperson and vice chairperson from their membership. The appeal board shall meet at least once per month but may meet as often as necessary.

The employment appeal board, subject to the approval of the director, may appoint personnel necessary for carrying out its functions and duties.\n\n4. The appeal board may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside a decision of an administrative law judge on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in the contested case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the parties to the decision to initiate further appeals before the appeal board. The appeal board shall permit further appeal by any of the parties interested in a decision of an administrative law judge and by the representative whose decision has been overruled or modified by the administrative law judge.

The appeal board may order testimony to be taken by deposition, and may compel persons to appear and testify and to produce books, papers, and documents in the same manner as witnesses may be deposed and compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the district court. In the discharge of the duties imposed by this chapter, the chairperson of the appeal board and any duly authorized representative designated by the appeal board, may administer oaths and affirmations, take depositions, certify official acts, and issue subpoenas. Persons deposed or compelled to testify or produce documentary evidence shall be allowed the same fees and traveling expenses as allowed witnesses in the district court.\n\n6.

All testimony at a hearing shall be recorded, but need not be transcribed unless the contested case is further appealed. The appeal board shall retain the record for at least sixty days following the final date for appeal of a contested case.

The appeal board may be represented in any such judicial review by an attorney who is a regular salaried employee of the appeal board or who has been designated by the appeal board for that purpose, or at the appeal board’s request, by the attorney general. Notwithstanding the petitioner’s residency requirement in section 17A.19, subsection 2, a petition for judicial review may be filed in the district court of the county in which the petitioner was last employed or resides, provided that if the petitioner does not reside in this state, the action shall be brought in the district court of Polk county, Iowa, and any other party to the proceeding before the appeal board shall be named in the petition. Notwithstanding the thirty-day requirement in section 17A.19, subsection 6, the appeal board shall, within sixty days after filing of the petition for judicial review or within a longer period of time allowed by the court, transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire records of a contested case. The appeal board may also certify to the court, questions of law involved in any decision by the appeal board.

The appropriate and efficient use or prospective use of the proposed institutional health service, and of any existing similar services, including but not limited to a consideration of the capacity of the sponsor’s facility to provide the proposed service, and possible sharing or cooperative arrangements among existing facilities and providers.\n\ni. The availability of resources, including, but not limited to, health care providers, management personnel, and funds for capital and operating needs, to provide the proposed institutional health services and the possible alternative uses of those resources to provide other health services.\n\nj. The appropriate and nondiscriminatory utilization of existing and available health care providers. Where both allopathic and osteopathic institutional health services exist, each application shall be considered in light of the availability and utilization of both allopathic and osteopathic facilities and services in order to protect the freedom of choice of consumers and health care providers.\n\nk. The relationship, including the organizational relationship, of the proposed institutional health services to ancillary or support services.\n\nl. Special needs and circumstances of those entities which provide a substantial portion of their services or resources, or both, to individuals not residing in the immediate geographic area in which the entities are located, which entities may include but are not limited to medical and other health professional schools, multidisciplinary clinics, and specialty centers.\n\nm.

For purposes of this subchapter, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Administrator” means the person coordinating the administration of the division.\n\nb. “Division” means the administrative hearings division of the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing.\n\n2. The administrator shall coordinate the division’s conduct of appeals and administrative hearings as provided by law, shall serve as chief administrative law judge of the division, and may conduct any proceeding for which the division provides an administrative law judge.\n\n3. a. The department shall employ a sufficient number of administrative law judges to conduct proceedings for which agencies are required, by section 17A.11 or any other provision of law, to use an administrative law judge employed by the division. An administrative law judge employed by the division shall not perform duties inconsistent with the judge’s duties and responsibilities as an administrative law judge and shall be located in an office that is separated from the offices of the agencies for which that person acts as a presiding officer. Administrative law judges, except the chief administrative law judge, shall be covered by the merit system provisions of chapter 8A, subchapter IV.\n\nb. The division shall facilitate, insofar as practicable, specialization by its administrative law judges so that particular judges may become expert in presiding over cases in particular agencies. An agency may, by rule, identify particular classes of its contested cases for which the administrative law judge who acts as presiding officer shall have specified technical expertness. After the adoption of such a rule, the division may assign administrative law judges to preside over those identified particular classes of contested cases only if the administrative law judge possesses the technical expertness specified by agency rule. The division may charge the applicable agency for the costs of any training required by the division’s administrative law judges to acquire or maintain the technical expertise specified by agency rule.\n\n4. If the division cannot furnish one of its administrative law judges in response to an agency request, the administrator shall designate in writing a full-time employee of an agency other than the requesting agency to serve as administrative law judge for the proceeding, but only with the consent of the employing agency. The designee must possess the same qualifications required of administrative law judges employed by the division.\n\n5. The division may furnish administrative law judges on a contract basis to any governmental entity to conduct any proceeding.\n\n6. A person shall not be employed by the division as the administrator or as an administrative law judge to preside over contested case proceedings unless that person has a license to practice law in this state.\n\n7. The division shall adopt rules pursuant to this chapter and chapter 17A to do all of the following:\n\na. To establish procedures for agencies to request and for the administrator to assign administrative law judges employed by the division.\n\nb. To establish procedures and adopt forms, consistent with chapter 17A and other provisions of law, to govern administrative law judges employed by the division, but any rules adopted under this paragraph shall be applicable to a particular contested case proceeding only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the rules of the agency under whose authority that proceeding is conducted. Nothing in this paragraph precludes an agency from establishing procedural requirements otherwise within its authority to govern its contested case proceedings, including requirements with respect to the timeliness of decisions rendered for it by administrative law judges.\n\nc. To establish standards and procedures for the evaluation, training, promotion, and discipline for the administrative law judges employed by the division. The procedures shall include provisions for each agency for whom a particular administrative law judge presides to submit to the division on a periodic basis the agency’s views with respect to the performance of that administrative law judge or the need for specified additional training for that administrative law judge. However, the evaluation, training, promotion, and discipline of all administrative law judges employed by the division shall remain solely within the authority of the department.\n\nd. To establish, consistent with the provisions of this section and chapter 17A, a code of administrative judicial conduct that is similar in function and substantially equivalent to the Iowa code of judicial conduct, to govern the conduct, in relation to their quasi-judicial functions in contested cases, of all persons who act as presiding officers under the authority of section 17A.11, subsection 1. The code of administrative judicial conduct shall separately specify which provisions are applicable to agency heads or members of multimembered agency heads when they act as presiding officers, taking into account the objectives of the code and the fact that agency heads, unlike administrative law judges, have other duties imposed upon them by law. The code of administrative judicial conduct may also contain separate provisions, that are appropriate and consistent with the objectives of such a code, to govern the conduct of agency heads or the members of multimember agency heads when they act as presiding officers. However, a provision of the code of administrative judicial conduct shall not be made applicable to agency heads or members of multimember agency heads unless the application of that provision to agency heads and members of multimember agency heads has previously been approved by the administrative rules coordinator.\n\ne. To facilitate the performance of the responsibilities conferred upon the division by this section, chapter 17A, and any other provision of law.\n\n8. The division may do all of the following:\n\na. Provide administrative law judges, upon request, to any agency that is required to or wishes to utilize the services of an administrative law judge employed by the division.\n\nb. Maintain a staff of reporters and other personnel.\n\nc. Administer the provisions of this section and rules adopted under its authority.\n\n9. The division may charge agencies for services rendered and the payment received shall be considered repayment receipts as defined in section 8.2.\n\n10.
