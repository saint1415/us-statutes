      "text": "29C.6 Proclamation of disaster emergency by governor.\n\nIn exercising the governor’s powers and duties under this chapter and to effect the policy and purpose, the governor may:\n\n1. After finding a disaster exists or is threatened, proclaim a state of disaster emergency. This proclamation shall be in writing, indicate the area affected and the facts upon which it is based, be signed by the governor, and be filed with the secretary of state. If the state of disaster emergency specifically constitutes a public health disaster as defined in section 135.140, the written proclamation shall include a statement to that effect. A state of disaster emergency shall continue for thirty days, unless sooner terminated or extended in writing by the governor. The general assembly may, by concurrent resolution, rescind this proclamation. If the general assembly is not in session, the legislative council may, by majority vote, rescind this proclamation. Rescission shall be effective upon filing of the concurrent resolution or resolution of the legislative council with the secretary of state. A proclamation of disaster emergency shall activate the disaster response and recovery aspect of the state, local, and interjurisdictional disaster emergency plans applicable to the political subdivision or area in question and be authority for the deployment and use of any forces to which the plan applies, and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, and materials and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available.\n\n2. When, at the request of the governor, the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in this state, enter into purchase, lease, or other arrangements with any agency of the United States for temporary housing units to be occupied by disaster victims and to make such units available to any political subdivision of the state, to assist any political subdivision of this state which is the locus of temporary housing for disaster victims, to acquire sites necessary for such temporary housing and to do all things required to prepare such sites to receive and utilize temporary housing units, by advancing or lending funds available to the governor from any appropriation made by the legislature or from any other source, allocating funds made available by any agency, public or private, or becoming a copartner with the political subdivision for the execution and performance of any temporary housing for disaster victims project. Any political subdivision of this state is expressly authorized to acquire, temporarily or permanently, by purchase, lease, or otherwise, sites required for installation of temporary housing units for disaster victims, and to enter into whatever arrangements are necessary to prepare or equip such sites to utilize the housing units. The governor may temporarily suspend or modify, for not to exceed sixty days, any public health, safety, zoning, transportation, or other requirement of law or regulation within this state when by proclamation, the governor deems such suspension or modification essential to provide temporary housing for disaster victims.\n\n3. When the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in the state and upon the governor’s determination that a local government of the state will suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenues from a major disaster and has demonstrated a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental functions, apply to the federal government, on behalf of the local government for a loan, receive and disburse the proceeds of any approved loan to any applicant local government, determine the amount needed by any applicant local government to restore or resume its governmental functions, and certify the same to the federal government; however, no application amount shall exceed twenty-five percent of the annual operating budget of the applicant for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs. The governor may recommend to the federal government, based upon the governor’s review, the cancellation of all or any part of repayment when, in the first three full fiscal year period following the major disaster, the revenues of the local government are insufficient to meet its operating expenses, including additional disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.\n\n4. When a disaster emergency is proclaimed, notwithstanding any other provision of law, through the use of state agencies or the use of any of the political subdivisions of the state, clear or remove from publicly or privately owned land or water, debris and wreckage which may threaten public health or safety or public or private property. The governor may accept funds from the federal government and utilize such funds to make grants to any local government for the purpose of removing debris or wreckage from publicly or privately owned land or water. Authority shall not be exercised by the governor unless the affected local government, corporation, organization, or individual shall first present an additional authorization for removal of such debris or wreckage from public and private property and, in the case of removal of debris or wreckage from private property, such corporation, organization, or individual shall first agree to hold harmless the state or local government against any claim arising from such removal. The state and any of its officers or employees who are engaged in the removal of debris or wreckage on public property shall not be liable to the affected local government on account of any act or omission in good faith while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection with the removal of debris or wreckage. For purposes of this subsection, “good faith” shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness. When the governor provides for clearance of debris or wreckage, employees of the designated state agencies or individuals appointed by the state may enter upon private land or waters and perform any tasks necessary to the removal or clearance operation. Any state employee or agent complying with orders of the governor and performing duties pursuant to such orders under this chapter shall be considered to be acting within the scope of employment within the meaning specified in chapter 669.\n\n5. When the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in the state and upon the governor’s determination that financial assistance is essential to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by a major disaster that cannot be otherwise adequately met from other means of assistance, accept a grant by the federal government to fund such financial assistance, subject to such terms and conditions as may be imposed upon the grant and enter into an agreement with the federal government pledging the state to participate in the funding of the financial assistance authorized in an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent thereof, and, if state funds are not otherwise available to the governor, accept an advance of the state share from the federal government to be repaid when the state is able to do so.\n\n6. Suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders or rules, of any state agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any statute, order or rule would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency by stating in a proclamation such reasons. Upon the request of a local governing body, the governor may also suspend statutes limiting local governments in their ability to provide services to aid disaster victims.\n\n7. On behalf of this state, enter into mutual aid arrangements with other states, including mutual aid arrangements with other states that extend the terms and conditions set forth in the interstate emergency management assistance compact described in section 29C.21 to situations in which an emergency or disaster proclamation has not been made by the governor of an affected state, and to coordinate mutual aid plans between political subdivisions of this state.\n\n8. Delegate any administrative authority vested in the governor under this chapter and provide for the subdelegation of any such authority.\n\n9. Cooperate with the president of the United States and the heads of the armed forces, the emergency management agencies of the United States and other appropriate federal officers and agencies and with the officers and agencies of other states in matters pertaining to emergency management of the state and nation.\n\n10. Utilize all available resources of the state government as reasonably necessary to cope with the disaster emergency and of each political subdivision of the state.\n\n11. Transfer the direction, personnel, or functions of state departments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency management.\n\n12. Subject to any applicable requirements for compensation, commandeer or utilize any private property if the governor finds this necessary to cope with the disaster emergency.\n\n13. Direct the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area within the state if the governor deems this action necessary for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response, or recovery.\n\n14. Prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation.\n\n15. Control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises in such area.\n\n16. Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transportation of alcoholic beverages, explosives, and combustibles.\n\n17. a. When the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in the state and upon the governor’s determination that financial assistance is essential to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of local and state government adversely affected by a major disaster that cannot be otherwise adequately met from other means of assistance, accept a grant by the federal government to fund the financial assistance, subject to terms and conditions imposed upon the grant, and enter into an agreement with the federal government pledging the state to participate in the funding of the financial assistance authorized to local government and eligible private nonprofit agencies in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the total eligible expenses, with the applicant providing the balance of any participation amount. If financial assistance is granted by the federal government for state disaster-related expenses or serious needs, the state shall participate in the funding of the financial assistance authorized in an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent of the total eligible expenses. If financial assistance is granted by the federal government for hazard mitigation, the state may participate in the funding of the financial assistance authorized to a local government in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the eligible expenses, with the applicant providing the balance of any participation amount. If financial assistance is granted by the federal government for state-related hazard mitigation, the state may participate in the funding of the financial assistance authorized, not to exceed fifty percent of the total eligible expenses. If state funds are not otherwise available to the governor, an advance of the state share may be accepted from the federal government to be repaid when the state is able to do so.\n\nb. State participation in funding financial assistance under paragraph “a” is contingent upon the local government having on file a state-approved, comprehensive emergency plan which meets the standards adopted pursuant to section 29C.9, subsection 8.\n\n[C62, §28A.3; C66, 71, 73, 75, §29C.3; C77, 79, 81, §29C.6; 81 Acts, ch 32, §2]\n\n85 Acts, ch 53, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1139, §4; 99 Acts, ch 86, §3, 4; 2003 Acts, ch 33, §7, 11; 2011 Acts, ch 69, §3; 2014 Acts, ch 1014, §1; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §76; 2017 Acts, ch 69, §35; 2022 Acts, ch 1081, §1; 2023 Acts, ch 66, §7\n\nReferred to in §8D.9, 16.57B, 16.194, 16.194A, 16.196, 29C.7, 29C.8, 29C.24, 53.2, 68A.405A, 100D.13, 135.140, 135.144, 135M.1, 135M.3, 135M.4, 161A.75, 418.4, 423.6, 455B.262A, 613.17, 670.4\n\nEmergency care or assistance rendered during disasters, see §613.17\n\nSubsection 3 amended",

Moneys in the fund may be expended following the governor’s proclamation of a state of disaster emergency. The executive council may make financial grants to meet disaster-related expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by a disaster which cannot otherwise be met by other means of financial assistance. The aggregate total of grants awarded shall not be more than one million dollars during a fiscal year. However, within the same fiscal year, additional funds may be specifically authorized by the executive council to meet additional needs.\n\n2. The grant funds shall be administered by the department. The department shall adopt rules to create the Iowa disaster aid individual assistance grant program. The rules shall specify the eligibility of applicants and eligible items for grant funding. The executive council shall use grant funds to reimburse the department for its actual expenses associated with the administration of the grants. The department may implement an ongoing contract with a provider or providers of a statewide program with local offices throughout the state to serve as the local administrative entity for the grant program so that the program can be implemented with minimal delay when a disaster occurs in a local area. The rules adopted by the department for the program shall include but are not limited to all of the following:\n\na. If a local administrative entity is under contract with the state to provide other services or is implementing a state or federal program and the contract contains a sufficient surety bond or other adequate financial responsibility provision, the department shall accept the existing surety bond or financial responsibility provision in lieu of applying a new or additional surety bond or financial responsibility requirement.\n\nb. If the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in this state and federal aid is made available to provide assistance grants to individuals similar to that provided by the Iowa disaster aid individual assistance grant program, the Iowa program shall be discontinued.\n\nc. Authorization for the local administrative entity to draw grant funding to pay valid claims on at least a weekly basis.\n\n3. To be eligible for a grant, an applicant shall have an annual household income that is less than two hundred percent of the federal poverty level based on the number of people in the applicant’s household as defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published by the United States department of health and human services. The amount of a grant for a household shall not exceed five thousand dollars. Expenses eligible for grant funding shall be limited to personal property, home repair, food assistance, and temporary housing assistance. An applicant for a grant shall sign an affidavit committing to refund any part of the grant that is duplicated by any other assistance, such as but not limited to insurance or assistance from community development groups, charities, the small business administration, and the federal emergency management agency.\n\n4. A recipient of grant funding shall receive reimbursement for expenses upon presenting a receipt for an eligible expense or shall receive a voucher through a voucher system developed by the department and administered locally within the designated disaster area. A voucher system shall ensure sufficient data collection to discourage and prevent fraud. The department shall consult with long-term disaster recovery committees and disaster recovery case management committees in developing a voucher system.\n\n5. The department shall submit an annual report, by January 1 of each year, to the legislative fiscal committee and the general assembly’s standing committees on government oversight concerning the activities of the grant program in the previous fiscal year.\n\n2007 Acts, ch 145, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1078, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 86, §3; 2010 Acts, ch 1150, §1; 2011 Acts, ch 69, §10; 2012 Acts, ch 1078, §1; 2012 Acts, ch 1138, §14, 42, 45; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §2164\n\nReferred to in §7D.29\n\nSubsections 2, 4, and 5 amended",

Article I — Purpose and authorities.\n\na. This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.\n\nb. The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resource shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.\n\nc. This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ national guard forces, either in accordance with the national guard mutual assistance compact or by mutual agreement between states.\n\n2. Article II — General implementation.\n\na. Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.\n\nb. The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.\n\nc. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.\n\n3. Article III — Party state responsibilities.\n\na. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:\n\n(1) Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.\n\n(2) Review party states’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.\n\n(3) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.\n\n(4) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.\n\n(5) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.\n\n(6) Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.\n\n(7) Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.\n\nb. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide all of the following:\n\n(1) A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.\n\n(2) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.\n\n(3) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party’s response and a point of contact at that location.\n\nc. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.\n\n4. Article IV — Limitations. Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.\n\n5. Article V — Licenses and permits. Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.\n\n6. Article VI — Liability. Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.\n\n7. Article VII — Supplementary agreements. Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.\n\n8. Article VIII — Compensation. Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.\n\n9. Article IX — Reimbursement. Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.\n\n10. Article X — Evacuation. Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management or services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.\n\n11. Article XI — Implementation.\n\na. This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.\n\nb. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nc. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.\n\n12. Article XII — Validity. This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in article I hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n13. Article XIII — Additional provisions. Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the national guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the president is authorized by law to call into federal active duty the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the army or the air force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under 18 U.S.C. §1385.\n\n[C62, §28A.3; C66, 71, 73, 75, §29C.3; C77, 79, 81, §29C.21]\n\n97 Acts, ch 129, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2012 Acts, ch 1072, §25\n\nReferred to in §29C.6, 29C.8, 29C.20, 135.143, 669.2",
