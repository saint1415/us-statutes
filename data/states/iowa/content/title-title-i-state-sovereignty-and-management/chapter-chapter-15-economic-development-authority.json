If the authority releases such information to a third party, the authority shall ensure that the third party protects such information from public disclosure. After the authority has considered a request for confidentiality pursuant to subsection 3, any information not deemed confidential shall be made publicly available. Any information deemed confidential by the authority shall also be kept confidential during and following administration of a contract executed pursuant to a successful application. Information deemed confidential may be treated as such for as long as the authority deems necessary to protect an applicant’s competitive position, and the confidential treatment of the information shall apply whether the authority is in possession of the information or whether the information has been sent to off-site storage or to the state archivist.\n\n3.

If confidential details are withheld from a request for records pursuant to chapter 22, the authority shall release an explanation of why the information was deemed confidential and a summary of the nature of the information withheld and the reasons for withholding it. In considering requests for confidential treatment, the authority shall narrowly construe the provisions of this section in order to appropriately balance an applicant’s need for confidentiality against the public’s right to information about the authority’s activities.\n\n4.

The nature and extent of competition in the applicant’s industry sector.\n\nb. The likelihood of adverse financial impact to the applicant if the information were to be released.\n\nc. The risk that the applicant will locate in another state if the request is denied.\n\nd.

If the qualifying investment is ten million dollars or more, the community has approved the project by ordinance or resolution for the purpose of receiving the benefits of this part.\n\nb. (1) The business shall not be solely relocating operations from one area of the state while seeking state or local incentives. A project that does not create new jobs or involve a substantial amount of new capital investment shall be presumed to be a relocation. In determining whether a business is solely relocating operations for purposes of this subparagraph, the authority shall consider a letter of support for the move from the affected local community.\n\n(2) The business shall not be in the process of reducing operations in one community while simultaneously applying for assistance under the program. For purposes of this subparagraph, a reduction in operations within twelve months before or after an application for assistance is submitted to the authority shall be presumed to be a reduction in operations while simultaneously applying for assistance under the program.\n\n(3) This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a business from expanding its operation in a community if existing operations of a similar nature in this state are not closed or substantially reduced.\n\nc. The business shall create or retain jobs as part of a project, and the jobs created or retained shall meet one of the following qualifying wage thresholds:\n\n(1) If the business is creating jobs, the business shall demonstrate that the jobs will pay at least one hundred percent of the qualifying wage threshold at the start of the project completion period, at least one hundred twenty percent of the qualifying wage threshold by the project completion date, and at least one hundred twenty percent of the qualifying wage threshold until the maintenance period completion date.\n\n(2) If the business is retaining jobs, the business shall demonstrate that the jobs retained will pay at least one hundred twenty percent of the qualifying wage threshold throughout both the project completion period and the maintenance period.\n\nd. The business shall provide a sufficient package of benefits to each employee holding a created or retained job. The board, at the recommendation of the authority, shall adopt rules determining what constitutes a sufficient package of benefits.\n\ne. The business shall demonstrate that the jobs created or retained will have a sufficient impact on state and local government revenues as determined by the authority after calculating the fiscal impact ratio of the project.\n\nf. The business shall not be a retail business or a business where entrance is limited by a cover charge or membership requirement.\n\ng. Notwithstanding the qualifying wage threshold requirements in paragraph “c”, if a business is also the recipient of financial assistance under another program administered by the authority, and the other program requires the payment of higher wages than the wages required under this subsection, the business shall be required to pay the higher wages.\n\n2. a. If the authority finds that a business has a record of violations of the law, including but not limited to antitrust, environmental, and worker safety statutes, rules, and regulations, that over a period of time tends to show a consistent pattern or that establishes intentional, criminal, or reckless conduct in violation of such laws, the business shall not qualify for economic development assistance under this part, except as provided in paragraph “b”.\n\nb. If the authority finds that the violations described in paragraph “a” did not seriously affect public health, public safety, or the environment, or if the authority finds that there were mitigating circumstances involved, the business may qualify for economic development assistance under this part, notwithstanding paragraph “a”.\n\nc. In making the findings and determinations regarding violations, mitigating circumstances, and whether the business is disqualified for economic development assistance under this part, the authority shall be exempt from chapter 17A.\n\n3. The authority shall also consider a variety of factors including but not limited to the following in determining the eligibility of a business to participate in the program:\n\na. The quality of the jobs to be created or retained. In rating the quality of the jobs, the authority shall place greater emphasis on those jobs that have a higher wage scale, have a lower turnover rate, are full-time or career-type positions, provide comprehensive health benefits, or have other related factors which could be considered to be higher in quality, than to other jobs. Businesses that have wage scales substantially below that of existing Iowa businesses in that area should be rated as providing the lowest quality of jobs and should therefore be given the lowest ranking for providing such assistance.\n\nb. The impact of the proposed project on other businesses in competition with the business being considered for assistance. The authority shall make a good-faith effort to identify existing Iowa businesses within an industry in competition with the business being considered for assistance. The authority shall make a good-faith effort to determine the probability that the proposed financial assistance will displace employees of the existing businesses. In determining the impact on businesses in competition with the business being considered for assistance, jobs created or retained as a result of other jobs being displaced elsewhere in the state shall not be considered direct jobs created or retained.\n\nc. The economic impact to this state of the proposed project. In measuring the economic impact, the authority shall place greater emphasis on projects which can demonstrate the existence of one or more of the following conditions:\n\n(1) A business with a greater percentage of sales out-of-state or of import substitution.\n\n(2) A business with a higher proportion of in-state suppliers.\n\n(3) A project which would provide greater diversification of the state economy.\n\n(4) A business with fewer in-state competitors.\n\n(5) A potential for future job growth.\n\n(6) A project which is not a retail operation.\n\n4. In addition to the factors in subsection 3, in determining the eligibility of a business to participate in the program the authority may consider whether a proposed project will provide a licensed center for use by the business’s employees.\n\n5.

A business that is approved to receive incentives or assistance under this part shall, for the length of the agreement, certify annually to the authority the compliance of the business with the requirements of the agreement. If the business receives a local property tax exemption, the business shall also certify annually to the community the compliance of the business with the requirements of the agreement.\n\n2. The repayment of incentives or financial assistance by the business if the business does not meet any of the requirements of this part or the resulting agreement. The repayment of incentives pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a tax payment due and payable to the department of revenue by any taxpayer who has claimed such incentives, and the failure to make such a repayment may be treated by the department of revenue in the same manner as a failure to pay the tax shown due or required to be shown due with the filing of a return or deposit form. In addition, the county shall have the authority to take action to recover the value of property taxes not collected as a result of the exemption provided to the business under this part.\n\n3. If a business that is approved to receive incentives or assistance under this part experiences a layoff within the state or closes any of its facilities within the state, the authority shall have the discretion to reduce or eliminate some or all of the incentives or assistance. If a business has received incentives or assistance under this part and experiences a layoff within the state or closes any of its facilities within the state, the business may be subject to repayment of all or a portion of the incentives or financial assistance that it has received.\n\n4. A project completion date, a maintenance period completion date, the number of jobs to be created or retained, or certain other terms and obligations as the authority deems necessary in order to make the requirements in project agreements uniform.

The business shall not be relocating or reducing operations as described in section 15.329, subsection 1, paragraph “b”.\n\n8. The proposed project shall not negatively impact other businesses in competition with the business being considered for assistance. The authority shall make a good-faith effort to identify existing Iowa businesses within an industry in competition with the business being considered for incentives or assistance. The authority shall make a good-faith effort to determine the probability that the proposed incentives or assistance will displace employees of the existing businesses. In determining the impact on businesses in competition with the business being considered for incentives or assistance, jobs created or retained as a result of other jobs being displaced elsewhere in the state shall not be considered direct jobs created or retained.\n\n9. A report submitted to the authority by a business together with its application describing all violations of environmental law or worker safety law within the last five years. If, upon review of the application, the authority finds that the business has a record of violations of the law, statutes, rules, or regulations that tends to show a consistent pattern, the authority shall not provide incentives or assistance to the business unless the authority finds either that the violations did not seriously affect public health, public safety, or the environment, or, if such violations did seriously affect public health, public safety, or the environment, that mitigating circumstances were present.\n\n10. That the business shall only employ individuals legally authorized to work in this state. In addition to any and all other applicable penalties provided by current law, all or a portion of the incentives or assistance received under this part by a business that is found to knowingly employ individuals not legally authorized to work in this state is subject to recapture by the authority or by the department of revenue.\n\n11. Any terms deemed necessary by the authority to effect compliance with the eligibility requirements of section 15.329.\n\n12. a. The imposition of a one-time compliance cost fee of five hundred dollars to be collected by the authority prior to the issuance of a tax incentive certificate or the disbursement of financial assistance.\n\nb.

In such case, the authority shall reduce the tax incentive award and the corresponding amount of tax incentives the eligible housing project may claim under section 15.355, subsections 2 and 3, by the same percentage that the housing project’s average dwelling unit cost exceeds the applicable maximum amount under section 15.353, subsection 3, and such tax incentive reduction shall be reflected on the tax credit certificate. If the authority issues a certificate pursuant to this subparagraph division, the department of revenue shall accept the certificate notwithstanding that the housing project’s average dwelling unit costs exceed the maximum amount specified in section 15.353, subsection 3.\n\n(c) If the project costs cause the housing project’s average dwelling unit cost to exceed one hundred fifty percent of the applicable maximum amount authorized in section 15.353, subsection 3, the authority shall determine the eligible housing business to be in default under the agreement, shall revoke the tax incentive award, and shall not issue a tax credit certificate.

This paragraph “a” applies to housing projects awarded tax incentives pursuant to subsection 2 on or after July 1, 2019, and to housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2019, under section 15.354, subsection 2, Code 2019.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), and section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”, if the sum of the amount of tax incentives applied for in valid applications submitted in a given fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2019, for housing projects located in small cities, plus the amount of tax incentives eligible for issuance to housing projects located in small cities that were registered prior to July 1, 2019, under section 15.354, subsection 2, Code 2019, does not exceed the amount reserved for housing projects located in small cities pursuant to section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”, the authority may award the remaining amount of tax incentives reserved for housing projects located in small cities to other housing projects during that same fiscal year.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), and section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”, the authority may award during a fiscal year an aggregate amount of tax incentives to housing projects located in small cities that is less than the amount reserved for allocation to small cities under section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”, provided the difference between the amount of the small city reservation and the aggregate amount actually awarded to small cities during that fiscal year is awarded during that same fiscal year to housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2018.\n\nb. With regard to a housing project registered prior to July 1, 2019, a tax incentive shall be considered awarded for purposes of paragraph “a” when the authority enters into an agreement with the housing business for that housing project as provided under section 15.354, subsection 3, Code 2019. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a housing business shall have no right to enter into an agreement with the authority for a housing project registered prior to July 1, 2019, until the authority allocates an amount of tax incentives to the housing project and notifies the housing business that the authority is prepared to execute the agreement and make a tax incentive award for the housing project. A housing business shall have no right to receive a tax credit certificate or claim a tax incentive for a housing project registered prior to July 1, 2019, until the housing business enters into an agreement with the authority.\n\nc. In making tax incentive awards during any fiscal year in which there are housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2019, which are eligible to receive tax incentives under the program, the authority shall give priority in making tax incentive awards to housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2019. The authority shall create and maintain a wait list of housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2019, and such housing projects shall be placed on the wait list in the order the housing projects were registered.\n\nd. The maximum aggregate amount of tax incentives that may be awarded and issued under section 15.355 to a housing business for a housing project shall not exceed one million dollars.\n\ne. If a housing business qualifies for a higher amount of tax incentives under section 15.355 than is allowed by the limitation imposed in paragraph “d”, the authority and the housing business may negotiate an apportionment of the reduction in tax incentives between the sales tax refund provided in section 15.355, subsection 2, and the workforce housing investment tax credits provided in section 15.355, subsection 3, provided the total aggregate amount of tax incentives after the apportioned reduction does not exceed the amount in paragraph “d”.\n\nf. The authority shall issue tax incentives under the program on a first-come, first-served basis until the maximum amount of tax incentives allocated under section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”, is reached. The authority shall maintain a list of housing projects registered prior to July 1, 2019, and of housing projects awarded tax incentives on or after July 1, 2019, so that if the maximum aggregate amount of tax incentives is reached in a given fiscal year, such registered housing projects that were completed but for which tax incentives were not issued, and such housing projects that were completed and are awarded tax incentives but for which tax incentives have not been issued, shall be placed on a wait list in the order the housing projects were registered or awarded tax incentives and shall be given priority for receiving tax incentives in succeeding fiscal years.\n\n5. Termination and repayment. The failure by a housing business in completing a housing project to comply with any requirement of this program or any of the terms and obligations of an agreement entered into pursuant to this section may result in the revocation, reduction, termination, or rescission of the tax incentive award or the approved tax incentives and may subject the housing business to the repayment or recapture of tax incentives claimed under section 15.355. The repayment or recapture of tax incentives pursuant to this section shall be accomplished in the same manner as provided in section 15.330, subsection 2.\n\n6. Disaster recovery housing projects.\n\na. For purposes of this subsection, “disaster recovery housing project” means a qualified housing project located in a county that has been declared a major disaster by the president of the United States on or after March 12, 2019, and that is also a county in which individuals are eligible for federal individual assistance.\n\nb. Notwithstanding subsection 1, the authority may establish a disaster recovery application period following the declaration of a major disaster by the president of the United States for a county in Iowa.\n\nc. Upon review, and scoring of all applications received during a disaster recovery application period, the authority may make a tax incentive award to a disaster recovery housing project. The tax incentive award shall represent the maximum amount of tax incentives that the disaster recovery housing project may qualify for under the program. In determining a tax incentive award, the authority shall not use an amount of project costs that exceeds the amount included in the application of the housing business. Tax incentive awards shall be approved by the director of the authority.\n\nd. The authority shall administer tax credit allocations for disaster recovery housing projects separately from the general allocation and separately from the allocation reserved for small cities in section 15.119, subsection 2, paragraph “g”. The authority shall issue tax incentives under the program for disaster recovery housing projects on a first-come, first-served basis until the maximum amount of tax incentives allocated under section 15.119, subsection 5, is reached. The authority shall maintain a list of disaster recovery housing projects awarded tax incentives under the program, so that if the maximum aggregate amount of tax incentives allocated for disaster recovery housing projects under the program is reached in a given fiscal year, such disaster recovery housing projects that were completed but for which tax incentives were not issued shall be placed on a wait list in the order the disaster recovery housing projects were awarded tax incentives pursuant to paragraph “c”, and shall be given priority for receiving tax incentives in succeeding fiscal years.\n\n2014 Acts, ch 1130, §16, 24 – 26; 2015 Acts, ch 138, §129, 131, 132; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §76; 2017 Acts, ch 134, §7; 2018 Acts, ch 1157, §1, 3; 2019 Acts, ch 159, §19 – 25, 31, 32; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §5; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §9; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §36 – 38; 2022 Acts, ch 1007, §10 – 13\n\nReferred to in §15.106B, 15.119, 15.355\n\n2019 amendments to subsections 1 – 3, 5, and 6 apply to housing projects awarded tax incentives by the authority under the program on or after July 1, 2019, and housing projects registered by the authority under the program prior to July 1, 2019, shall be governed by sections 15.352, 15.354, and 15.355, Code 2019;\n\n2019 Acts, ch 159, §32\n\n2019 amendment to subsection 4 applies to housing projects registered by the authority under the program prior to July 1, 2019, and to housing projects awarded tax incentives by the authority under the program on or after July 1, 2019;\n\n2019 Acts, ch 159, §32\n\n2022 amendment to subsection 3, paragraph e, subparagraph (2), subparagraph divisions (b) and (c) applies retroactively to July 1, 2021, to all eligible housing businesses the authority has not notified of the amount the business may claim as a refund of sales and use tax under section 15.355, subsection 2, and to all eligible housing businesses the authority has not issued a tax credit certificate stating the amount of workforce housing investment tax credits that the business may claim under section 15.355, subsection 3;\n\n2022 Acts, ch 1007, §13",
