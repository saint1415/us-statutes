The auditor of state shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 17A to establish and collect a periodic examination fee from cities that are not required to have an audit or required fiscal year examination conducted pursuant to subsection 1 during a fiscal year. Such fees are due on March 31 each year. The auditor of state shall base the fees on a sliding scale, based on the city’s budgeted gross expenditures, to produce total revenue of not more than three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars for each fiscal year. However, cities that pay a filing fee for an audit or examination pursuant to subsection 10 during the fiscal year are not required to pay the examination fee. The funds collected shall be maintained in a segregated account for use by the office of the auditor of state in performing periodic examinations conducted pursuant to subsection 1. However, if the fees collected in one fiscal year exceed three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars, the auditor of state shall apply the excess funds to provide training to city officials on municipal financial management or shall contract with a qualified organization to provide such training.
