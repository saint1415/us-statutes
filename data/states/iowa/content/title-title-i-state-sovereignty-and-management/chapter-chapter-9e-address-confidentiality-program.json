The purpose of this chapter is to enable state and local agencies to respond to requests for data without disclosing the location of a victim of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, assault, stalking, or human trafficking; to enable interagency cooperation with the secretary of state in providing address confidentiality for victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, assault, stalking, or human trafficking; and to enable program participants to use an address designated by the secretary of state as a substitute mailing address for the purposes specified in this chapter. In addition, the purpose of this chapter is to prevent such victims from being physically located through a public records search.\n\n2015 Acts, ch 96, §2, 17; 2021 Acts, ch 183, §1",
