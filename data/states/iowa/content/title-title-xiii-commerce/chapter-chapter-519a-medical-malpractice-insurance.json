The purposes of sections519A.2 through 519A.13 are to assure that the public is adequately protected against lossesarising out of medical malpractice by providing licensed health care providers with medicalmalpractice insurance through the requirement that certain liability insurance carriers writemedical malpractice insurance for a period of two years upon a finding of an emergency bythe commissioner of insurance that either such insurance is not available through normalchannels or that it is not available on a reasonable basis because of lack of competition forsuch insurance, or otherwise; to establish an association to equitably spread the risks forsuch insurance; and to provide for recoupment of losses resulting from the operation of theassociation through a stabilization reserve fund contributed to by insureds, a surcharge onfuture liability insurance policies, or a favorable premium tax treatment. 2. It is the intent of this chapter to provide only an interim solution to the impending unavailability of medical malpractice insurance. It is not anticipated that this chapter willresolve the underlying causes of the unavailability and high cost which extend beyond theinsurance mechanism. It is anticipated that future legislation will be required to deal on amore permanent basis with the underlying causes of the current situation.
