A fraudulenttransfer made or an obligation incurred by a seller whose business is ordered to be liquidatedunder this chapter may be avoided by the liquidator, except as to a person who in good faithis a purchaser, lienor, or obligee for a present fair equivalent value. A purchaser, lienor, orobligee, who in good faith has given a consideration less than present fair equivalent valuefor such transfer, lien, or obligation, may retain the property, lien, or obligation as securityfor repayment. The court may, on due notice, order any such transfer, lien, or obligation tobe preserved for the benefit of the estate, and in that event, the receiver shall succeed to andmay enforce the rights of the purchaser, lienor, or obligee.\n\nb.\n\n(1) A transfer of property other than real property is made when it becomes perfected so that a subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contractcould not become superior to the rights of the transferee under subsection 9, paragraph\n\n“c”\n\n.

(3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien is not perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be perfected. (4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation is deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition. (5) This subsection applies whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained a lien or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers. 8.\n\nFraudulent transfer after petition.a.\n\nAfter a petition for liquidation has been filed, a transfer of real property of the seller made to a person acting in good faith is valid against the liquidator if made for a presentfair equivalent value. If the transfer is not made for a present fair equivalent value, then thetransfer is valid to the extent of the present consideration actually paid for which amount thetransferee shall have a lien on the property transferred. The commencement of a proceedingin liquidation is constructive notice upon the recording of a copy of the petition for or orderof liquidation with the recorder of deeds in the county where any real property in question islocated. The exercise by a court of the United States or a state or jurisdiction to authorize ajudicial sale of real property of the seller within a county in a state shall not be impaired by thependency of a proceeding unless the copy is recorded in the county prior to the consummationof the judicial sale.\n\nb.\n\nAfter a petition for liquidation has been filed and before either the liquidator takes possession of the property of the seller or an order of liquidation is granted: (1) A transfer of the property, other than real property, of the seller made to a person acting in good faith is valid against the liquidator if made for a present fair equivalent value.If the transfer was not made for a present fair equivalent value, then the transfer is valid tothe extent of the present consideration actually paid for which amount the transferee shallhave a lien on the property transferred.

If a liquidation order is entered while the seller is already subjectto a receivership, then the transfers are preferences if made or suffered within one year beforethe filing of the successful petition for the receivership, or within two years before the filingof the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter. (2) A preference may be avoided by the liquidator if any of the following exist:(a) The seller was insolvent at the time of the transfer.(b) The transfer was made within four months before the filing of the petition.(c) At the time the transfer was made, the creditor receiving it or to be benefited by the transfer or the creditor’s agent acting with reference to the transfer had reasonable cause tobelieve that the seller was insolvent or was about to become insolvent.

(3) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property. If the property has been converted, the liquidator may recover its value from a person who hasreceived or converted the property. However, if a bona fide purchaser or lienor has givenless than the present fair equivalent value, the purchaser or lienor shall have a lien upon theproperty to the extent of the consideration actually given. Where a preference by way oflien or security interest is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or securityinterest to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall passto the liquidator.\n\nb.\n\n(1) A transfer of property other than real property is made when it becomes perfected so that a subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contractcould not become superior to the rights of the transferee. (2) A transfer of real property is made when it becomes perfected so that a subsequent bona fide purchaser from the seller could not obtain rights superior to the rights of thetransferee. (3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien is not perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created. (4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation is deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition. (5) This subsection applies whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.\n\nc.\n\n(1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment ordecree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon,or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens whichunder applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time. (2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings may become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser may obtain rights superior to the rights of a transfereewithin the meaning of paragraph\n\n“b”\n\n, if such consequences follow only from the lien orpurchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by a step wholly within the controlof the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by Sat Dec 23 01:02:05 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 523A.901 (20, 0)\n\n§523A.901, CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES\n\n6\n\npublic officials. However, a lien could not become superior and a purchase could not createsuperior rights for the purpose of paragraph\n\n“b”\n\nthrough an act subsequent to the obtainingof a lien or subsequent to a purchase which requires the agreement or concurrence of anythird party or which requires further judicial action or ruling.\n\nd.\n\nA transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration, which is under paragraph\n\n“b”\n\nmade or suffered after the transfer because of delay inperfecting it, does not become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any actsrequired by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as againstliens or a bona fide purchaser’s rights are performed within twenty-one days or any periodexpressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if a loanis actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the sameeffect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\ne.\n\nIf a lien which is voidable under paragraph\n\n“a”\n\n, subparagraph (2), has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety of which has been indemnified directlyor indirectly by the transfer or the creation of a lien upon property of a seller before thefiling of a petition under this chapter which results in the liquidation order, the indemnifyingtransfer or lien is also voidable.\n\nf.\n\nThe property affected by a lien voidable under paragraphs\n\n“a”\n\nand\n\n“e”\n\nis discharged from the lien.

However, the court may on due notice order alien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that the conveyancebe executed to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\ng.\n\nThe court shall have summary jurisdiction in a proceeding by a liquidator to hear and determine the rights of the parties under this section. Reasonable notice of hearing in theproceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bondor other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying propertyin kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, upon application of any party in interest,the court shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien. If the valueis less than the amount for which the property is indemnified or less than the amount of thelien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of itsvalue, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator within the time as fixed by the court.\n\nh.\n\nThe liability of a surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation is discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying liennullified and avoided by the liquidator. Where the property is retained under paragraph\n\n“g”\n\n,the liability of the surety is discharged to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.\n\ni.\n\nIf a creditor has been preferred for property which becomes a part of the seller’s estate, and afterward in good faith gives the seller further credit without security of any kind, theamount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off againstthe preference which would otherwise be recoverable from the creditor.\n\nj.\n\nIf within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate, a seller, directlyor indirectly, pays money or transfers property to an attorney for services rendered or tobe rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall beexamined by the court on petition of the liquidator. The payment or transfer shall be heldvalid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court. The excessmay be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate. However, where the attorneyis in a position of influence in the business of the seller or an affiliate, payment of any moneyor the transfer of any property to the attorney for services rendered or to be rendered shall begoverned by the provisions of paragraph\n\n“a”\n\n, subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (d).\n\nk.\n\n(1) An officer, manager, employee, shareholder, subscriber, attorney, or other person acting on behalf of the seller who knowingly participates in giving any preference when theperson has reasonable cause to believe the seller is or is about to become insolvent at thetime of the preference is personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference.There is an inference that reasonable cause exists if the transfer was made within four monthsbefore the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation. (2) A person receiving property from the seller or the benefit of the property of the seller Sat Dec 23 01:02:05 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 523A.901 (20, 0)\n\nas a preference voidable under paragraph\n\n“a”\n\nis personally liable for the property and shallaccount to the liquidator.
