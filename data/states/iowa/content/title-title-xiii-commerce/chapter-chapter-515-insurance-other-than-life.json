Guaranty shareholders shall be members of the corporation, and provision may be made for representation of the shareholders of the guaranty capital on the board of directorsof the corporation. The representation shall not exceed one-third of the membership of theboard. Guaranty shareholders in a mutual company are subject to the same regulations oflaw relative to their right to vote as apply to its policyholders. 3. The guaranty capital shall be applied to the payment of the legal obligations of the corporation only when the corporation has exhausted its assets in excess of the unearnedpremium reserve and other liabilities. If the guaranty capital is thus impaired, the directorsmay restore the whole, or any part of the capital, by assessment on the corporation’spolicyholders as provided for in section 515.18. 4. By a legal vote of the policyholders of the corporation at any regular or special meeting of the policyholders of the corporation, the guaranty capital may be fully retired or maybe reduced to an amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars, if the net surplus of thecorporation together with the remaining guaranty capital is equal to or exceeds the amountof minimum assets required by this chapter for such companies, and if the commissionerof insurance consents to the action. Due notice of the proposed action on the part of thecorporation shall be included in the notice given to policyholders and shareholders of anyannual or special meeting and notice of the meeting shall also be given in accordance withthe corporation’s articles of incorporation. 5. A company with guaranty capital, which has ceased to do business, shall not distribute among its shareholders or policyholders any part of its assets, or guaranty capital, until ithas fully performed, or legally canceled, all of its policy obligations.
