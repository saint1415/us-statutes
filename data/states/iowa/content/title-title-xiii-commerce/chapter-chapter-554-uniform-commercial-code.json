Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee’s reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additionalconsideration is not nominal if:\n\na.\n\nwhen the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the timethe option is to be performed; or\n\nb.\n\nwhen the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to beperformed. 5. The “remaining economic life of the goods” and “reasonably predictable” fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determinedwith reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into. 2007 Acts, ch 41, §14, 57Referred to in §554.1201 Sat Dec 23 01:49:11 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 554.1203 (24, 0)",

Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, andenforcement of the security interest remain effective, but the seller is liable to the buyer fordamages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably beprevented by the buyer, and a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief,including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of thesecurity interest or consummation of the enforcement. 4. Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’sperformance. 5. An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language orthe circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegationof performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes apromise by the assignee to perform those duties.

The seller may so allocate in any mannerwhich is fair and reasonable. 3. The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under subsection 2, of the estimated quota thus made availablefor the buyer.

Discharge, under section 554.3604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right ofrecourse against the discharged party. 3. If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extensiondischarges an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the partywhose obligation is extended to the extent the endorser or accommodation party proves thatthe extension caused loss to the endorser or accommodation party with respect to the rightof recourse. 4. If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, themodification discharges the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a rightof recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modificationcauses loss to the endorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.The loss suffered by the endorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification isequal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument provesthat no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification wasan amount less than the amount of the right of recourse. 5. If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral,the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against theobligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral isimpaired to the extent the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount ofthe right of recourse of the party asserting discharge, or the reduction in value of the interestcauses an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds thevalue of the interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge. 6. If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the valueof the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liablewith respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causesthe party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay,taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred. If the partyasserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection 5,the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability ratherthan a right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on the party assertingdischarge. 7. Under subsection 5 or 6, impairing value of an interest in collateral includes failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral; release of collateralwithout substitution of collateral of equal value; failure to perform a duty to preserve thevalue of collateral owed, under Article 9 or other law, to a debtor or surety or other personsecondarily liable; or failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral. 8. An accommodation party is not discharged under subsection 3, 4, or 5 unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or has notice under section554.3419, subsection 3, that the instrument was signed for accommodation. 9. A party is not discharged under this section if the party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or the instrument or a separateagreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section either specificallyor by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship orimpairment of collateral. 94 Acts, ch 1167, §77, 121, 122; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §151Referred to in §554.3419 Sat Dec 23 01:57:10 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 554.3605 (26, 0)",

If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantitywithin a reasonable time after receiving the shipper’s request in a record to do so. In thatcase, “shipper’s weight” or words of similar import are ineffective. 4. The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words “shipper’s weight, load, and count”, or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded bythe shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by theimproper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damagescaused by improper loading. 5. A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by theshipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuraciesin those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer’s responsibility orliability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.
