In furtherance of such state interest, in this chapter the general assembly provides methods for substituted service of process upon such persons or insurers in any proceeding,suit or action in any court and substitute service of any notice, order, pleading, or processupon such persons or insurers in any proceeding before the commissioner of insurance toenforce or effect full compliance with the insurance and tax laws of this state.
