In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the institution shall actin good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exerciseunder similar circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, all of the following factors:\n\na.\n\nThe duration and preservation of the endowment fund.\n\nb.\n\nThe purposes of the institution and the endowment fund.\n\nc.\n\nGeneral economic conditions.\n\nd.\n\nThe possible effect of inflation or deflation.\n\ne.\n\nThe expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments.\n\nf.\n\nOther resources of the institution.\n\ng.\n\nThe investment policy of the institution.2. In order to limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection 1, a gift instrument must specifically state the limitation. 3. Terms in a gift instrument designating a gift as an endowment, or a direction or authorization in the gift instrument to use only “income”, “interest”, “dividends”, or “rents,issues, or profits”, or “to preserve the principal intact”, or words of similar import do all ofthe following:\n\na.\n\nCreate an endowment fund of permanent duration unless other language in the gift instrument limits the duration or purpose of the fund.\n\nb.\n\nDo not otherwise limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection 1. 4.\n\na.\n\nIf a gift instrument uses the terms or phrases described in subsection 3, the gift instrument may also contain language substantially similar to the following: A direction or authorization herein to use only “income”, “interest”, “dividends”, or “rents, issues, or profits”, or to “preservethe principal intact” or words of similar import, does not limit theexpenditures from the endowment fund only to income, interest,dividends, or rents, issues, or profits. Expenditures may also comefrom other assets in the endowment fund.

In determining the amounts to be expended annually or to beaccumulated, account shall be taken of the following factors: theduration and preservation of the endowment fund, the purposes ofthe endowment fund; general economic conditions; the possibleeffect of inflation or deflation; the expected total return from incomeand the appreciation of investments; other recourses available tocarry out the charitable purposes of this gift; and the governinginvestment policies. Because these factors govern expendituresand accumulations from the endowment fund created hereunder,terms such as those in the first sentence of this subsection shallbe interpreted, absent other express language to the contrary, ascreating an endowment fund of permanent duration, and suchwords do not limit the authority to expend or accumulate funds inaccordance with the factors listed above.\n\nb.\n\nThe absence of the foregoing language or words of similar import in a gift instrument does not invalidate the gift instrument or any gift, or portion of a gift, thereunder. 2008 Acts, ch 1066, §4, 11 Sat Dec 23 01:42:06 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 540A.104 (18, 0)",
