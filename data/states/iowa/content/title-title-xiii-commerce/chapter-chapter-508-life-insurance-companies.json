(2) However, in applying the percentages specified in subparagraph (1), subparagraph divisions (c) and (d), no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of theamount of insurance or an equivalent uniform amount. The date of issue of a policy for thepurpose of this subsection is the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\nb.\n\nIn the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount for the purpose of this subsection shall be deemed tobe the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing thesame endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term,the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the samepresent value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, provided that in the caseof a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under ageten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insuranceprovided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by thepolicy at age ten.\n\nc.\n\nThe adjusted premiums for a policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (1) the adjusted premiums for an otherwisesimilar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased duringthe period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (2) theadjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (1) and (2) being calculatedseparately and as specified in paragraphs\n\n“a”\n\nand\n\n“b”\n\nof this subsection except that, for thepurposes of paragraph\n\n“a”\n\n, subparagraph (1), subparagraph divisions (b), (c), and (d), theamount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation ofthe adjusted premiums referred to in item (2) in this paragraph shall be equal to the excessof the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in thecalculation of the adjusted premiums in item (1) in this paragraph.\n\nd.\n\n(1) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1958 standardordinary mortality table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued onfemale risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an agenot more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. The calculations for allpolicies of industrial insurance issued before January 1, 1968, shall be made on the basisof the 1941 standard industrial mortality table, except that a company may file with thecommissioner a written notice of its election that the adjusted premiums and present valuesshall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortalitytable, after a specified date before January 1, 1968. Whether or not any election has beenmade, the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table shall be the basis forthese calculations as to all policies of industrial insurance issued on or after January 1,1968. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policyfor calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that therate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum, except that a rateof interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on orafter July 1, 1974, and prior to January 1, 1980, and a rate of interest not exceeding five andone-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1980. (2) However, in calculating the present value under subparagraph (1) of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit,the rates of mortality assumed in the case of policies of ordinary insurance, may be notmore than those shown in the commissioners 1958 extended term insurance table, and inthe case of policies of industrial insurance, may be not more than one hundred thirty percentof the rates of mortality according to the 1941 standard industrial mortality table, exceptthat when the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table becomes applicableas specified in this paragraph, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than thoseshown in the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table. In addition, forinsurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation under subparagraph (1) of adjusted Sat Dec 23 00:40:48 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 508.37 (38, 0)\n\n§508.37, LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n\n4\n\npremiums and present values may be based on any other table of mortality that is specifiedby the company and approved by the commissioner. 7.\n\na.\n\n(1) This subsection applies to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection, as defined in paragraph\n\n“k”\n\n. Except as provided in paragraph\n\n“g”\n\n, theadjusted premiums for a policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be suchuniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year,excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards andalso excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy ina statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-upnonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjustedpremiums is equal to the sum of the following: (a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.(b) One percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. (c) One hundred twenty-five percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium, as defined in paragraph\n\n“b”\n\n. However, in applying this percentage a nonforfeiture net level premium shallnot be deemed to exceed four percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance isuniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the firstten policy years. (2) The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection is the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\nb.\n\nThe nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the presentvalue, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the dateof issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.\n\nc.\n\nIn the case of policies which on a basis guaranteed in the policy cause unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits orpremiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present valuesshall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do notchange from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of a change in thebenefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, andpresent values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums donot change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\nd.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n\n“g”\n\n, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for a policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiumsspecified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiumsto cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contractcharge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used incalculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the presentvalue, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all future adjustedpremiums is equal to the excess of the sum of the then present value of the then futureguaranteed benefits provided for by the policy plus the additional expense allowance, if any,over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiturebenefit under the policy.\n\ne.\n\nThe additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of one percent of the excess, if positive, of theaverage amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequentto the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning ofeach of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change,or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy, plus one hundredtwenty-five percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\nf.\n\nThe recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount described in subparagraph (1) by the amount described in subparagraph(2), where subparagraph (1) and subparagraph (2) are as follows: (1) The sum of the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy Sat Dec 23 00:40:48 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 508.37 (38, 0)\n\non or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due hadthe change not occurred, plus the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefitsprovided for by the policy. (2) The present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.\n\ng.\n\nNotwithstanding any contrary provision of this subsection, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in eachpolicy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policyissued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjustedpremiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issuedto provide those higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\nh.\n\nAdjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of either the commissioners 1980 standardordinary mortality table or, at the election of the company for any one or more specified plansof life insurance, the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten-yearselect mortality factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basisof the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table; and shall for all policies issuedin a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding thenonforfeiture interest rate as defined in paragraph\n\n“i”\n\nfor policies issued in that calendar year.However: (1) At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeitureinterest rate, as defined in paragraph\n\n“i”\n\n, for policies issued in the immediately precedingcalendar year. (2) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection 2, shall becalculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining theamount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any. (3) A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower thanthat specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values. (4) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed maybe not more than those shown in the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table forpolicies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioners 1961 industrial extendedterm insurance table for policies of industrial insurance. (5) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables referred to inthis paragraph. (6) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the nationalassociation of insurance commissioners and approved by rule adopted by the commissionerfor use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for thecommissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year selectmortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table.

If the commissioner approves by rulethe commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the national association ofinsurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard forpolicies or contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then thatminimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard providedby the valuation manual.
