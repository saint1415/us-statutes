If theproposed transferee does not meet the reasonable current qualifications of the franchisor,the franchisor may refuse to permit the transfer, provided that the refusal of the franchisorto consent to the transfer is not arbitrary or capricious. 2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a franchisor may exercise a right of first refusal contained in a franchise agreement after receipt of a proposal from the franchisee totransfer the franchise. 3. A franchisor may require as a condition of a transfer any of the following:\n\na.\n\nThat the transferee successfully complete a reasonable training program.\n\nb.\n\nThat a reasonable transfer fee be paid to reimburse the franchisor for the franchisor’s reasonable and actual expenses directly attributable to the transfer.\n\nc.\n\nThat the franchisee pay or make provision reasonably acceptable to the franchisor to pay any amount due the franchisor or the franchisor’s affiliate.\n\nd.\n\nThat the financial terms of the transfer comply at the time of the transfer with the franchisor’s current financial requirements for franchisees. 4. A franchisee may transfer the franchisee’s interest in the franchise, for the unexpired term of the franchise agreement, and a franchisor shall not require the franchisee or thetransferee to enter into a new or different franchise agreement as a condition of the transfer. 5.

A franchisee shall not circumvent the intended effect of a contractual provision governing the transfer of the franchise or an interest in the franchise by means ofa management agreement, lease, profit-sharing agreement, conditional assignment, or othersimilar device. 6. A franchisor shall not transfer its interest in a franchise unless the franchisor makes reasonable provision for the performance of the franchisor’s obligations under the franchiseagreement by the transferee. For purposes of this subsection,\n\n“reasonable provision”\n\nmeansthat upon the transfer, the entity assuming the franchisor’s obligations has the financialmeans to perform the franchisor’s obligations in the ordinary course of business, but doesnot mean that the franchisor transferring the franchise is required to guarantee obligationsof the underlying franchise agreement. 7. A transfer by a franchisee is deemed to be approved sixty days after the franchisee submits the request for consent to the transfer unless the franchisor withholds consent to thetransfer as evidenced in writing, specifying the reason or reasons for withholding the consent.The written notice must be delivered to the franchisee prior to the expiration of the sixty-dayperiod. Any such notice is privileged and is not actionable based upon a claim of defamation. 8.
