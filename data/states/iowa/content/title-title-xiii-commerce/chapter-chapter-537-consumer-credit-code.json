A lender, other than the issuer of a lender credit card, who, with respect to a particular transaction, makes a consumer loan for the purpose of enabling a consumer to buy or leasefrom a particular seller or lessor property or services, is subject to all claims and defensesof the consumer against the seller or lessor arising from that sale or lease of the property orservices if any of the following are applicable:\n\na.\n\nThe lender knows that the seller or lessor arranged for a commission, brokerage, or referral fee, for the extension of credit by the lender.\n\nb.\n\nThe lender is a person related to the seller or lessor, unless the relationship is remote or is not a factor in the transaction.\n\nc.\n\nThe seller or lessor guarantees the loan or otherwise assumes the risk of loss by the lender upon the loan.\n\nd.\n\nThe lender directly supplies the seller or lessor with the contract document used by the consumer to evidence the loan, and the seller or lessor has knowledge of the credit terms andparticipates in the preparation of the document.\n\ne.\n\nThe loan is conditioned upon the consumer’s purchase or lease of the property or services from the particular seller or lessor, but the lender’s payment of proceeds of the loanto the seller or lessor does not in itself establish that the loan was so conditioned.\n\nf.\n\nThe lender otherwise knowingly participates with the seller in the sale. The fact that the lender takes a security interest in property sold in that sale, or makes the proceeds of theloan payable to the seller does not in itself constitute knowing participation in the sale. 2. A claim or defense of a consumer specified in subsection 1 may be asserted against the lender under this section only if the consumer has made a good faith attempt to obtainsatisfaction from the seller or lessor with respect to the claim or defense and only to the extentof the amount owing to the lender with respect to the sale or lease of the property or servicesas to which the claim or defense arose at the time the lender has notice of the claim or defense.Notice of the claim or defense may be given prior to the attempt specified in this subsection.Written notice is effective when mailed or delivered. 3. For the purpose of determining the amount owing to the lender with respect to the sale or lease:\n\na.\n\nPayments received by the lender after the consolidation of two or more consumer loans, other than pursuant to open-end credit, are deemed to have been first applied to the paymentof the loans first made, and if the loans consolidated arose from loans made on the same day,payments are deemed to have been first applied to the smaller or smallest loan or loans.\n\nb.\n\nPayments received upon an open-end credit account are deemed to have been first applied to the payment of finance charges in the order of their entry to the account and thento the payment of debts in the order in which the entries of the debts are made to the account. 4. Except as provided in section 537.1107, an agreement may not contain a provision to limit or waive the claims or defenses of a consumer under this section.

In a consumer rental purchase agreement, after a lessee has been in default for three business days and has not voluntarily surrendered possession of the rented property, a lessormay give the lessee the notice provided in subsection 3 when the consumer has the rightto cure a default. A lessor gives the notice to the lessee under this section when the lessordelivers notice to the lessee or mails the notice to the last known address of the lessee. 2. For the purpose of this section, there is no right to cure and no limitation on the lessor’s rights with respect to a default that occurs within twelve months after an earlier default as towhich a lessor has given a proper notice of the lessee’s right to cure. 3. The notice of right to cure must be in writing and conspicuously state all of the following:\n\na.\n\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the lessor to whom payment is to be made.\n\nb.\n\nA brief identification of the transaction.\n\nc.\n\nThe lessee’s right to cure the default.\n\nd.\n\nThe amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to cure the default. A notice in substantially the following form complies with this subsection: THE NAME, ADDRESS, & TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THE LESSOR ACCOUNT NUMBER, IF ANY BRIEF IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSACTION ( ) is the last date for payment, ( ) is the amount now due. You have failed to renew your rental purchaseagreement(s). If you pay the amount now due (above) by the lastdate for payment (above), you may continue with the agreement asthough you had renewed on time. If you do not pay by that date, wemay exercise our rights under the law. If you are late again duringthe next twelve months of your agreement, in either returningthe property or renewing your agreement, we may exercise ourrights without sending you another notice like this one. If you havequestions, you may write or telephone the lessor promptly. 4. With respect to a consumer rental purchase agreement, except as provided in subsection 5, after a default consisting of the lessee’s failure to renew and failure to returnthe property, a lessor, because of that default, may not instigate court action to recover therented property until five business days after the notice of the lessee’s right to cure is given.In the case of an agreement with weekly or biweekly renewal dates, such action shall not betaken until three business days after the notice of the lessee’s right to cure is given. 5. With respect to defaults on the same consumer rental purchase agreement and subject to subsection 4, after a lessor has once given a proper notice of the lessee’s right to cure, thissection does not give the consumer a right to cure or impose any additional limitations beyondthose otherwise imposed by this part on the lessor’s right to proceed against the lessee or thelessor’s right to recover the property. 6. Until expiration of the minimum applicable periods contained in subsection 4 after notice is given, the lessee may cure all defaults consisting of failure to renew and failure toreturn the property by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of the tenderplus any unpaid delinquency charges or other charges authorized by section 537.3616. 7. This section and the provisions on limitations of agreements do not prohibit a lessee from voluntarily surrendering possession of the rented property, and the lessor fromenforcing any past due obligation which the lessee may have at any time after default.However, in an enforcement proceeding, the lessor shall affirmatively plead and prove eitherthat the notice to cure is not required or that the lessor has given the required notice, but thefailure to so plead does not invalidate any action taken by the lessor that is lawful and if thelessor has rightfully repossessed any property the repossession is not conversion.

As used in thisparagraph,\n\n“obligation”\n\nmeans the initial periodic lease payments and any other additionaladvance payments required at the consummation of the transaction.\n\nb.\n\nIn the case of a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, or consumer rental purchase agreement, knowledge by the seller or lessor at the time of the sale or lease of the inabilityof the consumer to receive substantial benefits from the property or services sold or leased.\n\nc.\n\nIn the case of a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, or consumer rental purchase agreement, gross disparity between the price of the property or services sold or leased and thevalue of the property or services measured by the price at which similar property or servicesare readily obtainable in consumer credit transactions by like consumers.\n\nd.\n\nThe fact that the creditor contracted for or received separate charges for insurance with respect to a consumer credit sale or consumer loan with the effect of making the sale or loan,considered as a whole, unconscionable.\n\ne.\n\nThe fact that the seller, lessor or lender has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the consumer or debtor reasonably to protect the consumer’s or debtor’s interests byreason of physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand thelanguage of the agreement, or similar factors.\n\nf.\n\nThe fact that the seller, lessor or lender has engaged in conduct with knowledge or reason to know that like conduct has been restrained or enjoined by a court in a civil actionby the administrator against any person pursuant to the provisions on injunctions againstfraudulent or unconscionable agreements or conduct in section 537.6111. 5. In applying subsection 2, violations of section 537.7103 shall be considered, among other factors, as applicable. 6. If in an action in which unconscionability is claimed the court finds unconscionability pursuant to subsection 1 or 2, the court shall award reasonable fees to the attorney for theconsumer or debtor.

Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be determined by the value ofthe time reasonably expended by the attorney on the unconscionability issue and not by theamount of the recovery on behalf of the prevailing party. 7. The remedies of this section are in addition to remedies otherwise available for the same conduct under law other than this chapter, but no double recovery of actual damagesmay be had. 8. For the purpose of this section, a charge or practice expressly permitted by this chapter is not in itself unconscionable.

Notwithstanding any term or agreement to the contrary, the obligation of a consumer in a consumer credit transaction is enforceable by a creditor only after compliance with thissection, except that in a consumer rental purchase agreement, default is governed by section537.3618. 2.\n\na.\n\nA creditor who believes in good faith that a consumer is in default may give the consumer written notice of the alleged default, and, if the consumer has a right to cure thedefault, shall give the consumer the notice of right to cure provided in section 537.5111before commencing any legal action in any court on an obligation of the consumer andbefore repossessing collateral. However, this subsection and subsection 4 do not require acreditor to give notice of right to cure prior to the filing of a petition by a creditor seeking toenforce the consumer’s obligation in which attachment under chapter 639 is sought uponany of the grounds specified in section 639.3, subsections 3 through 12.\n\nb.\n\nWhen property is attached without the giving of notice of right to cure as permitted by this subsection, the creditor immediately shall give notice of the attachment to the consumerin the same manner as prescribed by the rules of civil procedure for service of an originalnotice. The notice shall advise the consumer that the attachment may be discharged by thefiling of a bond as provided in sections 639.42 and 639.45, or by the filing of a motion withthe court to discharge the attachment pursuant to section 639.63. The notice required by thisparagraph is in lieu of the notice requirements of sections 639.31 and 639.33.\n\nc.\n\nWhen a motion is filed to discharge an attachment made without the giving of a prior notice of right to cure, the court shall hear the motion within three days of the filing of themotion to discharge. If the court finds that the attachment should not have been issued orshould not have been levied on all or any part of the property held, the attachment shallbe discharged in whole or in part and property wrongfully attached shall be returned to theconsumer.\n\nd.\n\nIf the court finds that there was no probable cause to believe the grounds upon which the attachment was issued, the consumer may be awarded damages plus reasonableattorney’s fees to be determined by the court. 3. A consumer has a right to cure the default unless, in other than an insurance premium loan transaction, the creditor has given the consumer a proper notice of right to cure withrespect to a prior default which occurred within three hundred sixty-five days of the presentdefault, or the consumer has voluntarily surrendered possession of goods that are collateraland the creditor has accepted them in full satisfaction of any debt owing on the transactionin default. 4. If the consumer has a right to cure a default:\n\na.\n\nA creditor shall not accelerate the maturity of the unpaid balance of the obligation, demand or take possession of collateral, otherwise than by accepting a voluntary surrenderof it, or otherwise attempt to enforce the obligation until twenty days after a proper notice ofright to cure is given.\n\nb.\n\nWith respect to an insurance premium loan, a creditor shall not give notice of cancellation as provided in subsection 6 until thirteen days after a proper notice of right tocure is given.\n\nc.\n\nUntil the expiration of the minimum applicable period after the notice is given, the consumer may cure the default by tendering either the amount of all unpaid installmentsdue at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferralcharges, or the amount stated in the notice of right to cure, whichever is less, or by tenderingany performance necessary to cure any default other than nonpayment of amounts due,which is described in the notice of right to cure. The act of curing a default restores to theconsumer the consumer’s rights under the agreement as though no default had occurred,except as provided in subsection 3. However, where the obligation in default is a credit cardaccount that has been closed, the act of curing a default does not restore to the consumerthe consumer’s rights under the agreement as though no default had occurred. 5. This section and the provisions on waiver, agreements to forego rights, and settlement of claims under section 537.1107 do not prohibit a consumer from voluntarily surrendering Sat Dec 23 01:40:54 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 537.5110 (21, 0)\n\n§537.5110, CONSUMER CREDIT CODE\n\n2\n\npossession of goods which are collateral and do not prohibit the creditor from thereafterenforcing the creditor’s security interest in the goods at any time after default. 6. If a default on an insurance premium loan is not cured, the lender may give notice of cancellation of each insurance policy or contract to be canceled. If given, the notice ofcancellation shall be in writing and given to the insurer that issued the policy or contract andto the insured. The insurer, within two business days after receipt of the notice of cancellationtogether with a copy of the insurance premium loan agreement if not previously given to theinsurer, shall give any notice of cancellation required by the policy or contract or by law and,within ten business days after the effective date of the cancellation, pay to the lender anypremium unearned on the policy or contracts as of that effective date. Within ten businessdays after receipt of the unearned premium, the lender shall pay to the consumer indebtedupon the insurance premium loan any excess of the unearned premium received over theamount owing by the consumer upon the insurance premium loan. 7. If a creditor in a consumer credit transaction commences an action for money judgment prior to giving the customer notice of right to cure as required by this section andfails to follow the procedures set out in this section, the court shall dismiss the action withoutprejudice. If the action was commenced as a small claim under chapter 631, the creditorshall not be found to be in violation of this section for purposes of section 537.5201 and thepenalties provided in that section shall not apply if the creditor proves by a preponderanceof the evidence that the creditor did not at the time of the violation have either knowledgeor reason to know of the requirements of this section, and for this purpose the court shallconsider all relevant evidence, including but not limited to the education or experience ofthe creditor with respect to the collection of debts arising from consumer credit transactionsand any representation of the creditor by legal counsel and any legal advice rendered to thecreditor with respect to the collection of debts arising from consumer credit transactions.
