Ifa quoted market price is available, the fair value is the product of the number of tradingunits times the quoted market price. If a quoted market price is not available, the estimateof fair value shall be based on the best information available.

A valuation technique for measuring financial assets and liabilities and servicing assets and liabilitiesshall be consistent with the objective of measuring fair value. A valuation technique shall incorporate assumptions that a market participant would use in estimating value,future revenue, and future expenses, including assumptions about interest rates, default,prepayment, and volatility. In measuring financial liabilities and servicing liabilities at fairvalue by discounting estimated future cash flows, discount rates shall be used at which thoseliabilities could be settled in an open and competitive transaction. An estimate of expectedfuture cash flow, if used to estimate fair value, shall be the best estimate based on reasonableand supportable assumptions and projections. All available evidence shall be considered indeveloping an estimate of expected future cash flow. The weight given to the evidence shallbe commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be verified objectively. If a rangeis estimated for either the amount or timing of possible cash flows, the likelihood of possibleoutcomes shall be considered in determining the best estimate of such future cash flows. 2000 Acts, ch 1046, §4Referred to in §521G.3For future repeal of this section, effective January 1, 2025, see 2023 Acts, ch 107, §30 Sat Dec 23 00:53:16 2023 Iowa Code 2024, Section 521G.4 (17, 2)",
