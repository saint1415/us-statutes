The subpoenas when issued shall be delivered to the licensee or registrant or the licensee’s or registrant’s counsel. Such subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses shall be effective if served upon the person named in the subpoena anywhere within this state, provided that, at the time of such service, the fees provided by law for attendance of witnesses in civil cases in district court are paid or tendered to the person.\n\ne. In case of disobedience of a subpoena lawfully served under this subsection, the board or any party to such hearing aggrieved thereby may invoke the aid of the district court in the county where the hearing is being conducted to require the attendance and testimony of such witnesses. The district court of the county within which the hearing is being conducted may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey the subpoena, issue an order requiring the person to appear before the board, and, if so ordered, to give evidence touching the matter involved in the hearing. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.\n\nf. If the licensee or registrant pleads guilty, or after hearing is found guilty by the board of any of the charges made, the board may suspend for a limited period or revoke the license or registration, and the last renewal of the license or registration, and shall enter the order on its records. The board shall notify the accused of the revocation or suspension of the person’s license or registration, as the case may be, and the person shall immediately surrender that license or registration to the board. Any person whose license or registration has been revoked or suspended shall not practice dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting within this state while the revocation or suspension is in force and effect.\n\ng. The findings of fact made by the board acting within its power shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive, but the district court shall have power to review questions of law involved in any final decision or determination of the board if application is made by the aggrieved party within thirty days after such determination by certiorari, mandamus, or such other method of review or appeal permitted under the laws of this state, and to make such further orders in respect thereto as justice may require.\n\nh. Pending the review and final disposition thereof by the district court, the action of the board suspending or revoking such license or registration shall not be stayed.\n\n4. An inspector may be appointed by the dental board pursuant to the provisions of chapter 8A, subchapter IV.\n\n5. a. The board may impose an administrative penalty of up to five hundred dollars on a licensee, registrant, or trainee of the board who does any of the following:\n\n(1) Engages in a practice regulated by this chapter without a current license, registration, permit, or qualification.\n\n(2) Employs a person without a current license, registration, permit, or qualification to engage in a practice regulated by this chapter.\n\n(3) Fails to complete the continuing education required for renewal of a license or registration.\n\nb. The assessment and payment of a penalty imposed pursuant to paragraph “a” shall not be considered a disciplinary action or reported as discipline and shall be confidential.\n\nc. A licensee, registrant, or trainee may contest a penalty issued pursuant to paragraph “a” by initiating a contested case proceeding pursuant to chapter 17A.\n\nd. This subsection shall not prohibit the board from imposing discipline on a licensee, registrant, or trainee for willful or repeated violations.\n\ne. An administrative penalty collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the general fund of the state.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §153.33]\n\n90 Acts, ch 1112, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1121, §2; 93 Acts, ch 41, §2; 2002 Acts, ch 1108, §19, 20; 2003 Acts, ch 44, §38, 39; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §200; 2007 Acts, ch 10, §136; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §263; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §192; 2015 Acts, ch 36, §1; 2016 Acts, ch 1073, §61; 2017 Acts, ch 29, §43; 2019 Acts, ch 85, §62; 2020 Acts, ch 1018, §2; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §85, 86\n\nReferred to in §272C.5\n\nSection not amended; internal reference change applied",
