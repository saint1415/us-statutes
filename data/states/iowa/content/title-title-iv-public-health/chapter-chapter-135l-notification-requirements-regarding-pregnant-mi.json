If the court fails to hold the hearing and rule on the petition within forty-eight hours of the filing of the petition and an extension is not requested, the petition is deemed granted and waiver of the notification requirements is deemed authorized. The court shall immediately provide documentation to the pregnant minor and to the pregnant minor’s legal counsel if the pregnant minor is represented by legal counsel, demonstrating that the petition is deemed granted and that waiver of the notification requirements is deemed authorized.
