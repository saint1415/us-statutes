It is unlawful for a person to employ an individual to practice barbering and cosmetology arts and sciences unless that individual is licensed or has obtained a temporary permit under this chapter. It is unlawful for a licensee to practice with or without compensation in any place other than a licensed establishment, or a licensed school of barbering and cosmetology arts and sciences. The following exceptions to this subsection shall apply:\n\na. A licensee may practice at a location which is not a licensed establishment, school of barbering and cosmetology arts and sciences, or licensed barbershop pursuant to rules adopted by the board.\n\nb. Notwithstanding section 157.12, when the licensee is employed by a physician and provides barbering and cosmetology services at the place of practice of a physician and is under the supervision of a physician licensed to practice pursuant to chapter 148.\n\nc. When the practice occurs in a facility licensed pursuant to chapter 135B or 135C.\n\n2. A licensed cosmetologist may work in a licensed barbershop. It is unlawful for a person to employ a licensed cosmetologist or barber, esthetician, or electrologist to perform the services described in section 157.3A if the licensee has not received the additional training and met the other requirements specified in section 157.3A.\n\n3. If the owner or manager of an establishment does not comply with the sanitary rules adopted under section 157.6 or fails to maintain the establishment as prescribed by rules of the department, the department may notify the owner or manager in writing of the failure to comply. If the rules are not complied with within five days after receipt of the written notice by the owner or manager, the department shall in writing order the establishment closed until the rules are complied with. It is unlawful for a person to practice in an establishment which has been closed under this section. The county attorney in each county shall assist the department in enforcing this section.\n\n4. If the board has reasonable grounds to believe that a person or establishment which is not licensed under this chapter has engaged, or is about to engage, in an act or practice which requires licensure under this chapter, or otherwise violates a provision of this chapter, the board may issue an order to require the unlicensed person or establishment to comply with the provisions of this chapter, and may impose a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation of this chapter by an unlicensed person or establishment. Each day of a continued violation after an order or citation by the board constitutes a separate offense, with the maximum penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars.\n\na. In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the board may consider the following:\n\n(1) Whether the amount imposed will be a substantial economic deterrent to the violation.\n\n(2) The circumstances leading to or resulting in the violation.\n\n(3) The severity of the violation and the risk of harm to the public.\n\n(4) The economic benefits gained by the violator as a result of noncompliance.\n\n(5) The welfare or best interest of the public.\n\nb. The board may conduct an investigation as needed to determine whether probable cause exists to initiate the proceedings described in this subsection. Before issuing an order or citation under this section, the board shall provide written notice and the opportunity to request a hearing on the record. The hearing must be requested within thirty days of the issuance of the notice and shall be conducted as provided in chapter 17A. The board may, in connection with a proceeding under this section, issue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the disclosure of evidence and may request the attorney general to bring an action to enforce the subpoena.\n\nc. A person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil penalty under this section may seek judicial review in accordance with section 17A.19. The board shall notify the attorney general of the failure to pay a civil penalty within thirty days after entry of an order pursuant to this subsection, or within ten days following final judgment in favor of the board if an order has been stayed pending appeal. The attorney general may commence an action to recover the amount of the penalty, including reasonable attorney fees and costs. An action to enforce an order under this subsection may be joined with an action for an injunction.\n\n[C31, 35, §2585-c12; C39, §2585.22; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 77, 79, 81, §157.13]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1110, §3; 92 Acts, ch 1205, §11; 2004 Acts, ch 1044, §12, 13; 2005 Acts, ch 89, §33; 2006 Acts, ch 1184, §103, 104; 2008 Acts, ch 1088, §111; 2023 Acts, ch 99, §41 – 43\n\nReferred to in §157.4\n\nSubsection 1, unnumbered paragraph 1 amended\n\nSubsection 1, paragraphs a and b amended\n\nSubsections 2 and 3 amended",
