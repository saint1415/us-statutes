The purpose of this chapter is to promote and encourage adequate and safe care and housing for individuals who are aged or who, regardless of age, are infirm, convalescent, or mentally or physically dependent, by both public and private agencies by providing for the adoption and enforcement of rules and standards for all of the following:\n\na. The housing, care, and treatment of individuals in health care facilities.\n\nb. The location, construction, maintenance, renovation, and sanitary operation of such health care facilities which will promote safe and adequate care of individuals in such homes so as to further the health, welfare, and safety of such individuals.\n\n2. Rules and standards prescribed, promulgated, and enforced under this chapter shall not be arbitrary, unreasonable, or confiscatory and the department or agency prescribing, promulgating, or enforcing such rules or standards shall have the burden of proof to establish that such rules or standards meet such requirements and are consistent with the economic problems and conditions involved in the care and housing of persons in health care facilities.\n\n3. a. The department shall establish by administrative rule the following special classifications:\n\n(1) Within the residential care facility category, a special license classification for residential facilities intended to serve persons with mental illness.\n\n(2) Within the nursing facility category, a special license classification for nursing facilities which designate and dedicate the facility or a special unit within the facility to provide care for persons who suffer from chronic confusion or a dementing illness. A nursing facility which designates and dedicates the facility or a special unit within the facility for the care of persons who suffer from chronic confusion or a dementing illness shall be specially licensed. For the purposes of this subsection, “designate” means to identify by a distinctive title or label and “dedicate” means to set apart for a definite use or purpose and to promote that purpose.\n\nb. The department may also establish by administrative rule special classifications within the residential care facility, intermediate care facility for persons with mental illness, intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, or nursing facility categories, for facilities intended to serve individuals who have special health care problems or conditions in common. Rules establishing a special classification shall define the problem or condition to which the special classification is relevant and establish requirements for an approved program of care commensurate with the problem or condition. The rules may grant special variances or considerations to facilities licensed within the special classification.\n\nc. The rules adopted for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability shall be consistent with, but no more restrictive than, the federal standards for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability established pursuant to the federal Social Security Act, §1905(c)(d), as codified in 42 U.S.C. §1396d, in effect on January 1, 1989. However, in order for an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability to be licensed, the director must certify to the department that the facility meets the applicable provisions of the rules adopted for such facilities by the director. The director’s rules shall be based upon such a facility’s compliance with either the provisions applicable to health care occupancies or residential board and care occupancies of the life safety code of the national fire protection association, 2000 edition. The department shall adopt additional rules for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability pursuant to section 135C.14, subsection 8.\n\nd. Notwithstanding the limitations set out in this subsection regarding rules for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability, the department shall consider the federal interpretive guidelines issued by the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid services when interpreting the department’s rules for intermediate care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability. This use of the guidelines is not subject to the rulemaking provisions of sections 17A.4 and 17A.5, but the guidelines shall be published in the Iowa administrative bulletin and the Iowa administrative code.\n\n4. The protection and advocacy agency designated in the state, under Pub. L. No. 98-527, the Developmental Disabilities Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 99-319, the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986, and Pub. L. No. 100-146, the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987, is recognized as an agency legally authorized and constituted to ensure the implementation of the purposes of this chapter for populations under its authority and in the manner designated by Pub. L. No. 98-527, Pub. L. No. 99-319, and Pub. L. No. 100-146 and in the assurances of the governor of the state.\n\n5. The department shall establish a special classification within the residential care facility category in order to foster the development of residential care facilities which serve persons with an intellectual disability, chronic mental illness, a developmental disability, or brain injury, as described under section 225C.26, and which contain five or fewer residents. A facility within the special classification established pursuant to this subsection is exempt from the requirements of section 10A.713. The department shall adopt rules which are consistent with rules previously developed for the waiver demonstration project pursuant to\n\n1986 Iowa Acts, ch. 1246, §206\n\n, and which include all of the following provisions:\n\na. A facility provider under the special classification must comply with rules adopted by the department for the special classification. However, a facility provider which has been accredited by the council on quality and leadership shall be deemed to be in compliance with the rules adopted by the department.\n\nb. A facility must be located in an area zoned for single or multiple-family housing or in an unincorporated area and must be constructed in compliance with applicable local requirements and the rules adopted for the special classification by the director in accordance with the concept of the least restrictive environment for the facility residents. Local requirements shall not be more restrictive than the rules adopted for the special classification by the director and the state building code requirements for single or multiple-family housing, under section 103A.7.\n\nc. Facility provider plans for the facility’s accessibility to residents must be in place.\n\nd. A written plan must be in place which documents that a facility meets the needs of the facility’s residents pursuant to individual program plans developed according to age appropriate and least restrictive program requirements.\n\ne. A written plan must be in place which documents that a facility’s residents have reasonable access to employment or employment-related training, education, generic community resources, and integrated opportunities to promote interaction with the community.\n\nf. The facilities licensed under this subsection shall be eligible for funding utilized by other licensed residential care facilities for persons with an intellectual disability, or licensed residential care facilities for persons with mental illness, including but not limited to funding under or from the federal social services block grant, the state supplementary assistance program, state mental health and developmental disabilities services funds, and county funding provisions.\n\n6. a. This chapter shall not apply to adult day services provided in a health care facility. However, adult day services shall not be provided by a health care facility to persons requiring a level of care which is higher than the level of care the facility is licensed to provide.\n\nb. The level of care certification provisions pursuant to sections 135C.3 and 135C.4, the license application and fee provisions pursuant to section 135C.7, and the involuntary discharge provisions pursuant to section 135C.14, subsection 8, shall not apply to respite care services provided in a health care facility. However, respite care services shall not be provided by a health care facility to persons requiring a level of care which is higher than the level of care the facility is licensed to provide.\n\nc. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.\n\n7. The rules adopted by the department regarding nursing facilities shall provide that a nursing facility may choose to be inspected either by the department or by the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations. The rules regarding acceptance of inspection by the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations shall include recognition, in lieu of inspection by the department, of comparable inspections and inspection findings of the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations, if the department is provided with copies of all requested materials relating to the inspection process.\n\n[C50, 54, §135C.5; C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §135C.2]\n\n85 Acts, ch 114, §1; 87 Acts, ch 234, §426; 88 Acts, ch 1249, §3; 89 Acts, ch 115, §1; 89 Acts, ch 269, §1; 90 Acts, ch 1039, §6; 90 Acts, ch 1267, §27; 91 Acts, ch 267, §139; 92 Acts, ch 1241, §48; 94 Acts, ch 1151, §2, 3; 94 Acts, ch 1170, §7, 22; 95 Acts, ch 67, §11; 96 Acts, ch 1053, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1129, §25, 26, 113; 98 Acts, ch 1119, §12; 99 Acts, ch 141, §11; 2001 Acts, ch 64, §3; 2002 Acts, ch 1050, §17; 2003 Acts, ch 44, §114; 2003 Acts, ch 101, §1, 4; 2012 Acts, ch 1019, §12 – 14; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §32; 2014 Acts, ch 1026, §143; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §43; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1610, 1611\n\nReferred to in §135B.9, 135C.37, 135C.38, 155.1, 235A.15, 235B.6, 235F.6\n\nRules requiring special license classification for facility or unit designated and dedicated to caring for persons with chronic confusion or a dementing illness; applicability; existing facilities;\n\n90 Acts, ch 1016, §1\n\nSubsection 7 is effective contingent upon passage of federal legislation; see\n\n96 Acts, ch 1053, §3\n\nSubsection 3, paragraph c amended\n\nSubsection 5, paragraph b amended",

At least one general unannounced inspection shall be conducted for each health care facility within a thirty-month period. The inspector shall show identification to the person in charge of the facility and state that an inspection is to be made before beginning the inspection. An employee of the department who gives unauthorized advance notice of an inspection made or planned to be made under this subsection or section 135C.38 shall be disciplined as determined by the director, except that if the employee is employed pursuant to the merit system provisions of chapter 8A, subchapter IV, the discipline shall not exceed the discipline authorized pursuant to that subchapter.\n\n2. a. The department shall prescribe by rule that any licensee or applicant for license desiring to make specific types of physical or functional alterations or additions to its facility or to construct new facilities shall, before commencing the alteration or additions or new construction, submit plans and specifications to the department for preliminary inspection and approval or recommendations with respect to compliance with the department’s rules and standards.\n\nb.

Each party to the contract shall be entitled to a duplicate original thereof, and the health care facility shall keep on file all contracts which it has with residents and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such contract for at least one year after its expiration. Each such contract shall expressly set forth:\n\na. The terms of the contract.\n\nb. The services and accommodations to be provided by the health care facility and the rates or charges therefor.\n\nc. Specific descriptions of any duties and obligations of the parties in addition to those required by operation of law.\n\nd. Any other matters deemed appropriate by the parties to the contract.

The denial of admission of a person to a health care facility shall not be based upon the patient’s condition, which is the existence of a specific disease in the patient, but the decision to accept or deny admission of a patient with a specific disease shall be based solely upon the ability of the health care facility to provide the level of care required by the patient.\n\n3. Except in emergencies, a resident who is not essentially capable of managing the resident’s own affairs shall not be transferred out of a health care facility or discharged for any reason without prior notification to the next of kin, legal representative, or agency acting on the resident’s behalf.

No owner, administrator, employee, or representative of a health care facility shall pay any commission, bonus, or gratuity in any form whatsoever, directly or indirectly, to any person for residents referred to such facility, nor accept any commission, bonus, or gratuity in any form whatsoever, directly or indirectly, for professional or other services or supplies purchased by the facility or by any resident, or by any third party on behalf of any resident, of the facility.\n\n5.

The court shall expeditiously hold a hearing on the application, at which the director shall present evidence in support of the application. The licensee against whose facility the petition is filed may also present evidence, and both parties may subpoena witnesses. The court may appoint a receiver for the health care facility in advance of the hearing if the director’s verified application states that an emergency exists which presents an imminent danger of resultant death or physical harm to the residents of the facility. If the licensee against whose facility the receivership petition is filed informs the court at or before the time set for the hearing that the licensee does not object to the application, the court shall waive the hearing and at once appoint a receiver for the facility.\n\n2. The court, on the basis of the verified application and evidence presented at the hearing, may order the facility placed under receivership, and if so ordered, the court shall direct either that the receiver assume the duties of administrator of the health care facility or that the receiver supervise the facility’s administrator in conducting the day-to-day business of the facility. The receiver shall be empowered to control the facility’s financial resources and to apply its revenues as the receiver deems necessary to the operation of the facility in compliance with this chapter and the rules or minimum standards promulgated under this chapter, but shall be accountable to the court for management of the facility’s financial resources.\n\n3. A receivership established under this section may be terminated by the district court which established it, after a hearing upon an application for termination. The application may be filed:\n\na. Jointly by the receiver and the current licensee of the health care facility which is in receivership, stating that the deficiencies in the operation, maintenance or other circumstances which were the grounds for establishment of the receivership have been corrected and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the facility will be operated in compliance with this chapter and the rules or minimum standards promulgated under this chapter.\n\nb. By the current licensee of the facility, alleging that termination of the receivership is merited for the reasons set forth in paragraph “a” of this subsection, but that the receiver has declined to join in the petition for termination of the receivership.\n\nc.

The receiver is not personally liable for the expenses of the facility during the receivership. The receiver is an employee of the state as defined in section 669.2, subsection 4, only for the purpose of defending a claim filed against the receiver. Chapter 669 applies to all suits filed against the receiver.\n\n5. This section does not:\n\na.

Prior to employment of a person in a facility or with a provider as specified in subsection 5, the facility or provider shall do one of the following:\n\n(1) Request that the department of public safety perform a criminal history check and the record check evaluation system of the department of health and human services perform child and dependent adult abuse record checks of the person in this state.\n\n(2) Access the single contact repository to perform the required record checks.\n\nc. (1) If a facility or a provider as specified in subsection 5 accesses the single contact repository to perform the required record checks pursuant to paragraph “b”, the facility or provider may utilize a third-party vendor to perform a comprehensive preliminary background check and provisionally employ a person being considered for employment pending completion of the required record checks through the single contact repository and the evaluation by the record check evaluation system, as applicable, subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) If the comprehensive preliminary background check determines that the person being considered for employment has been convicted of a crime, but the crime does not constitute a felony as defined in section 701.7 and is not a crime specified pursuant to chapter 708, 708A, 709, 709A, 710, 710A, 711, or 712, or pursuant to section 726.3, 726.27, or 726.28.\n\n(b) If the comprehensive preliminary background check determines the person being considered for employment does not have a record of founded child abuse or dependent adult abuse or if an exception pursuant to subsection 4 is applicable to the person.\n\n(c) If the facility or provider has requested an evaluation in accordance with subsection 2, paragraph “a”, to determine whether the crime warrants prohibition of the person’s employment in the facility or with the provider.\n\n(2) The provisional employment under this paragraph “c” may continue until such time as the required record checks through the single contact repository and the evaluation by the record check evaluation system, as applicable, are completed.\n\nd. A facility or provider shall inform all persons prior to employment regarding the performance of the record checks and shall obtain, from the persons, a signed acknowledgment of the receipt of the information. A facility or provider shall include the following inquiry in an application for employment:\n\nDo you have a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse or have you ever been convicted of a crime other than a simple misdemeanor offense relating to motor vehicles and laws of the road under chapter 321 or equivalent provisions, in this state or any other state?\n\n2. a. If it is determined that a person being considered for employment in a facility or with a provider has been convicted of a crime under a law of any state, the department of public safety shall notify the facility or provider that upon the request of the facility or provider the record check evaluation system will perform an evaluation to determine whether the crime warrants prohibition of the person’s employment in the facility or with the provider.\n\nb. (1) If a person being considered for employment, other than employment involving the operation of a motor vehicle, has been convicted of a crime listed in subparagraph (2) but does not have a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse and the facility or provider has requested an evaluation in accordance with paragraph “a” to determine whether the crime warrants prohibition of the person’s employment, the facility or provider may employ the person for not more than sixty calendar days pending completion of the evaluation.\n\n(2) Subparagraph (1) applies to a crime that is a simple misdemeanor offense under section 123.47, and to a crime that is a first offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated under section 321J.2, subsection 1.\n\nc. If a record check evaluation system child or dependent adult abuse record check shows that such person has a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse, the record check evaluation system shall notify the facility or provider that upon the request of the facility or provider the record check evaluation system will perform an evaluation to determine whether the founded child or dependent adult abuse warrants prohibition of employment in the facility or with the provider.\n\nd. An evaluation performed under this subsection shall be performed in accordance with procedures adopted for this purpose by the department of health and human services.\n\ne. (1) If a person owns or operates more than one facility or a provider owns or operates more than one location, and an employee of one of such facilities or provider locations is transferred to another such facility or provider location without a lapse in employment, the facility or provider is not required to request additional criminal and child and dependent adult abuse record checks of that employee.\n\n(2) If the ownership of a facility or provider is transferred, at the time of transfer the record checks required by this section shall be performed for each employee for whom there is no documentation that such record checks have been performed. The facility or provider may continue to employ such employee pending the performance of the record checks and any related evaluation.\n\n3. In an evaluation, the record check evaluation system shall consider the nature and seriousness of the crime or founded child or dependent adult abuse in relation to the position sought or held, the time elapsed since the commission of the crime or founded child or dependent adult abuse, the circumstances under which the crime or founded child or dependent adult abuse was committed, the degree of rehabilitation, the likelihood that the person will commit the crime or founded child or dependent adult abuse again, and the number of crimes or founded child or dependent adult abuses committed by the person involved. If the record check evaluation system performs an evaluation for the purposes of this section, the record check evaluation system has final authority in determining whether prohibition of the person’s employment is warranted.\n\n4. a. Except as provided in subsection 1, paragraph “c”, subsection 2, and paragraph “b” of this subsection, a person who has committed a crime or has a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse shall not be employed in a facility or with a provider unless an evaluation has been performed by the record check evaluation system.\n\nb. A person with a criminal or abuse record who is or was employed by a facility or provider and is hired by another facility or provider shall be subject to the criminal history and abuse record checks required pursuant to subsection 1. However, if an evaluation was previously performed by the record check evaluation system concerning the person’s criminal or abuse record and it was determined that the record did not warrant prohibition of the person’s employment and the latest record checks do not indicate a crime was committed or founded abuse record was entered subsequent to that evaluation, the person may commence employment with the other facility or provider in accordance with the record check evaluation system’s evaluation and an exemption from the requirements in paragraph “a” for reevaluation of the latest record checks is authorized. Otherwise, the requirements of paragraph “a” remain applicable to the person’s employment. Authorization of an exemption under this paragraph “b” from requirements for reevaluation of the latest record checks by the record check evaluation system is subject to all of the following provisions:\n\n(1) The position with the subsequent employer is substantially the same or has the same job responsibilities as the position for which the previous evaluation was performed.\n\n(2) Any restrictions placed on the person’s employment in the previous evaluation by the record check evaluation system shall remain applicable in the person’s subsequent employment.\n\n(3) The person subject to the record checks has maintained a copy of the previous evaluation and provides the evaluation to the subsequent employer or the previous employer provides the previous evaluation from the person’s personnel file pursuant to the person’s authorization. If a physical copy of the previous evaluation is not provided to the subsequent employer, the record checks shall be reevaluated.\n\n(4) Although an exemption under this paragraph “b” may be authorized, the subsequent employer may instead request a reevaluation of the record checks and may employ the person while the reevaluation is being performed.\n\n5. a. This section shall also apply to prospective employees of all of the following, if the provider is regulated by the state or receives any state or federal funding:\n\n(1) An employee of a homemaker-home health aide, home care aide, adult day services, or other provider of in-home services if the employee provides direct services to consumers.\n\n(2) An employee of a hospice, if the employee provides direct services to consumers.\n\n(3) An employee who provides direct services to consumers under a federal home and community-based services waiver.\n\n(4) An employee of an elder group home certified under chapter 231B, if the employee provides direct services to consumers.\n\n(5) An employee of an assisted living program certified under chapter 231C, if the employee provides direct services to consumers.\n\nb. In substantial conformance with the provisions of this section, including the provision authorizing provisional employment following completion of a comprehensive preliminary background check, prior to the employment of such an employee, the provider shall request the performance of the criminal and child and dependent adult abuse record checks. The provider shall inform the prospective employee and obtain the prospective employee’s signed acknowledgment. The record check evaluation system shall perform the evaluation of any criminal record or founded child or dependent adult abuse record and shall make the determination of whether a prospective employee of a provider shall not be employed by the provider.\n\n6. a. This section shall also apply to an employee of a temporary staffing agency that provides staffing for a facility, service, program, or other provider regulated by this section if the employee provides direct services to consumers.\n\nb. In substantial conformance with the provisions of this section, including the provision authorizing provisional employment following completion of a comprehensive preliminary background check, prior to the employment of such an employee, the temporary staffing agency shall request the performance of the criminal and child and dependent adult abuse record checks. The temporary staffing agency shall inform the prospective employee and obtain the prospective employee’s signed acknowledgment. The record check evaluation system shall perform the evaluation of any criminal record or founded child or dependent adult abuse record and shall make the determination of whether a prospective employee of a temporary staffing agency shall not be employed by the assisted living program as defined in section 231C.2, the Medicare certified home health agency, or the facility, service, program, or other provider regulated by this section.\n\nc. If a person employed by a temporary staffing agency that is subject to this section is convicted of a crime or has a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse entered in the abuse registry after the person’s employment application date, the person shall inform the temporary staffing agency within forty-eight hours and the temporary staffing agency shall inform the facility, service, program, or other provider within two hours.\n\nd. If a temporary staffing agency fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the temporary staffing agency shall be liable to the facility, service, program, or other provider for any actual damages, including civil penalties, and reasonable attorney fees.\n\ne. This section shall not apply to employees employed by a temporary staffing agency for a position that does not provide direct services to consumers.\n\n7. a. The department of inspections, appeals, and licensing, in conjunction with other departments and agencies of state government involved with criminal history and abuse registry information, shall establish a single contact repository for facilities and other providers to have electronic access to data to perform background checks for purposes of employment, as required of the facilities and other providers under this section.\n\nb. The department may access the single contact repository for any of the following purposes:\n\n(1) To verify data transferred from the department’s nurse aide registry to the repository.\n\n(2) To conduct record checks of applicants for employment with the department.\n\n8. a. If a person employed by a facility, service, or program employer that is subject to this section is convicted of a crime or has a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse entered in the abuse registry after the person’s employment application date, the person shall inform the employer of such information within forty-eight hours of the criminal conviction or entry of the record of founded child or dependent adult abuse. The employer shall act to verify the information within seven calendar days of notification. If the information is verified, the requirements of subsections 2, 3, and 4 regarding employability and evaluations shall be applied by the employer to determine whether or not the person’s employment is continued. The employer may continue to employ the person pending the performance of an evaluation by the record check evaluation system to determine whether prohibition of the person’s employment is warranted. A person who is required by this subsection to inform the person’s employer of a conviction or entry of an abuse record and fails to do so within the required period commits a serious misdemeanor.\n\nb. If a facility, service, or program employer receives credible information, as determined by the employer, that a person employed by the employer has been convicted of a crime or a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse has been entered in the abuse registry after employment from a person other than the employee and the employee has not informed the employer of such information within the period required under paragraph “a”, the employer shall act to verify the credible information within seven calendar days of receipt of the credible information. If the information is verified, the requirements of subsections 2, 3, and 4 regarding employability and evaluations shall be applied to determine whether or not the person’s employment is continued.\n\nc. The employer may notify the county attorney for the county where the employer is located of any violation or failure by an employee to notify the employer of a criminal conviction or entry of an abuse record within the period required under paragraph “a”.\n\n9. a. For the purposes of this subsection, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n(1) “Certified nurse aide training program” means a program approved in accordance with the rules for such programs adopted by the department of health and human services for the training of persons seeking to be a certified nurse aide for employment in any of the facilities or programs this section applies to or in a hospital, as defined in section 135B.1.\n\n(2) “Student” means a person applying for, enrolled in, or returning to a certified nurse aide training program.\n\nb. (1) Prior to a student beginning or returning to a certified nurse aide training program, the program shall do one of the following:\n\n(a) Request that the department of public safety perform a criminal history check and the record check evaluation system perform child and dependent adult abuse record checks, in this state, of the student.\n\n(b) Access the single contact repository to perform the required record checks.\n\n(2) If a program accesses the single contact repository to perform the required record checks pursuant to subparagraph (1), the program may utilize a third-party vendor to perform a comprehensive preliminary background check to allow a person to provisionally participate in the clinical component of the certified nurse aide training program pending completion of the required record checks through the single contact repository and the evaluation by the record check evaluation system, as applicable, subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) If the comprehensive preliminary background check determines that the person being considered for provisional participation has been convicted of a crime but the crime does not constitute a felony as defined in section 701.7 and is not a crime specified pursuant to chapter 708, 708A, 709, 709A, 710, 710A, 711, or 712, or pursuant to section 726.3, 726.27, or 726.28.\n\n(b) If the comprehensive preliminary background check determines the person being considered for provisional participation does not have a record of founded child abuse or dependent adult abuse or if an exception pursuant to subsection 4 is applicable to the person.\n\n(c) If the program has requested an evaluation in accordance with subsection 2, paragraph “a”, to determine whether the crime warrants prohibition of the person’s provisional participation.\n\n(d) The provisional participation under this subparagraph (2) may continue until such time as the required record checks through the single contact repository and the evaluation by the record check evaluation system, as applicable, are completed.\n\nc. If a student has a criminal record or a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse, the student shall not be involved in a clinical education component of the certified nurse aide training program involving children or dependent adults unless an evaluation has been performed by the record check evaluation system. Upon request of the certified nurse aide training program, the record check evaluation system shall perform an evaluation to determine whether the record warrants prohibition of the student’s involvement in a clinical education component of the certified nurse aide training program involving children or dependent adults. The evaluation shall be performed in accordance with the criteria specified in subsection 3, and the record check evaluation system shall report the results of the evaluation to the certified nurse aide training program. The record check evaluation system has final authority in determining whether prohibition of the student’s involvement in the clinical education component is warranted.\n\nd. (1) If a student’s clinical education component of the training program involves children or dependent adults but does not involve operation of a motor vehicle, and the student has been convicted of a crime listed in subparagraph (2), but does not have a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse, and the training program has requested an evaluation in accordance with paragraph “c” to determine whether the crime warrants prohibition of the student’s involvement in such clinical education component, the training program may allow the student’s participation in the component for not more than sixty days pending completion of the evaluation.\n\n(2) Subparagraph (1) applies to a crime that is a simple misdemeanor offense under section 123.47, and to a crime that is a first offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated under section 321J.2, subsection 1.\n\ne. (1) If a student is convicted of a crime or has a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse entered in the abuse registry after the record checks and any evaluation have been performed, the student shall inform the certified nurse aide training program of such information within forty-eight hours of the criminal conviction or entry of the record of founded child or dependent adult abuse. The program shall act to verify the information within seven calendar days of notification. If the information is verified, the requirements of paragraph “c” shall be applied by the program to determine whether or not the student’s involvement in a clinical education component may continue. The program may allow the student involvement to continue pending the performance of an evaluation by the record check evaluation system. A student who is required by this subparagraph to inform the program of a conviction or entry of an abuse record and fails to do so within the required period commits a serious misdemeanor.\n\n(2) If a program receives credible information, as determined by the program, that a student has been convicted of a crime or a record of founded child or dependent adult abuse has been entered in the abuse registry after the record checks and any evaluation have been performed, from a person other than the student and the student has not informed the program of such information within the period required under subparagraph (1), the program shall act to verify the credible information within seven calendar days of receipt of the credible information. If the information is verified, the requirements of paragraph “c” shall be applied to determine whether or not the student’s involvement in a clinical education component may continue.\n\n(3) The program may notify the county attorney for the county where the program is located of any violation or failure by a student to notify the program of a criminal conviction or entry of an abuse record within the period required under subparagraph (1).\n\nf. If a certified nurse aide training program is conducted by a health care facility and a student of that program subsequently accepts and begins employment with the facility within thirty days of completing the program, the criminal history and abuse registry checks of the student performed pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to fulfill the requirements for such checks prior to employment pursuant to subsection 1.\n\n94 Acts, ch 1130, §12; 97 Acts, ch 42, §1; 98 Acts, ch 1141, §2; 98 Acts, ch 1223, §20, 21; 99 Acts, ch 96, §11; 99 Acts, ch 114, §5; 2001 Acts, ch 8, §1; 2001 Acts, ch 20, §2, 3; 2001 Acts, ch 64, §4; 2002 Acts, ch 1050, §18; 2003 Acts, ch 166, §2; 2006 Acts, ch 1069, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1187, §112; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §36; 2010 Acts, ch 1012, §1, 2; 2012 Acts, ch 1074, §1; 2013 Acts, ch 21, §3, 4, 6, 7; 2014 Acts, ch 1040, §11 – 14; 2015 Acts, ch 30, §58; 2017 Acts, ch 58, §1; 2020 Acts, ch 1029, §5; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §179, 1889\n\nReferred to in §135B.34, 135C.36, 152.5A, 231B.2, 231C.3, 231D.14, 235A.15, 235A.16, 235B.6, 235B.7, 237A.5, 633.564\n\nLegislative intent;\n\n98 Acts, ch 1217, §36\n\nDepartment of inspections, appeals, and licensing to post list of third-party vendors eligible to conduct comprehensive preliminary background checks; 2020 Acts, ch 1029, §7\n\nSee Code editor’s note on simple harmonization at the beginning of this Code volume\n\nSection amended",

The department shall adopt and may from time to time modify, in accordance with chapter 17A, rules setting forth so far as feasible the specific violations included in each classification and stating criteria for the classification of any violation not so listed.\n\n1. A class I violation is one which presents an imminent danger or a substantial probability of resultant death or physical harm to the residents of the facility in which the violation occurs. A physical condition or one or more practices in a facility may constitute a class I violation. A class I violation shall be abated or eliminated immediately unless the department determines that a stated period of time, specified in the citation issued under section 135C.40, is required to correct the violation. A licensee is subject to a penalty of not less than two thousand nor more than ten thousand dollars for each class I violation for which the licensee’s facility is cited.\n\n2. A class II violation is one which has a direct or immediate relationship to the health, safety, or security of residents of a health care facility, but which presents no imminent danger nor substantial probability of death or physical harm to them. A physical condition or one or more practices within a facility, including either physical abuse of any resident or failure to treat any resident with consideration, respect, and full recognition of the resident’s dignity and individuality, in violation of a specific rule adopted by the department, may constitute a class II violation. A violation of section 135C.14, subsection 8, or section 135C.31 and rules adopted under those sections shall be at least a class II violation and may be a class I violation. A class II violation shall be corrected within a stated period of time determined by the department and specified in the citation issued under section 135C.40. The stated period of time specified in the citation may subsequently be modified by the department for good cause shown. A licensee is subject to a penalty of not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars for each class II violation for which the licensee’s facility is cited; however the director may, upon written request of the facility, waive the penalty if the violation is corrected within the time specified in the citation. The department shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 17A establishing criteria for the granting or denial of a waiver request.\n\n3. A class III violation is any violation of this chapter or of the rules adopted pursuant to it which violation is not classified in the department’s rules nor classifiable under the criteria stated in those rules as a class I or a class II violation. A licensee shall not be subject to a penalty for a class III violation, except as provided by section 135C.40, subsection 1, for failure to correct the violation within a reasonable time specified by the department in the notice of the violation.\n\n4. Any state penalty, including a fine or citation, issued following a state licensure and federal certification survey or investigation shall be dismissed if the corresponding federal deficiency is dismissed or removed. Any state penalty, including a fine or citation, shall be retained or reinstated if the federal deficiency is retained or reinstated.\n\n5. If a facility self-identifies a deficient practice prior to an on-site visit inspection, there has been no complaint filed with the department related to that specific deficient practice, and the facility corrects such practice prior to an inspection, no citation shall be issued or fine assessed pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 except for those penalties arising pursuant to section 135C.33;\n\n481 IAC 57.11(3) and (7)\n\n481 IAC 57.16(3)\n\n481 IAC 57.32\n\n481 IAC 57.34(1)\n\n481 IAC 58.11(3)\n\n481 IAC 58.14(5)\n\n481 IAC 58.19(2)(a)\n\n481 IAC 58.19(2)(h)\n\n481 IAC 58.28(1)(a)\n\n481 IAC 58.43\n\n481 IAC 63.8(3)\n\n481 IAC 63.27\n\n481 IAC 63.29(1)\n\n481 IAC 64.4(9)\n\n481 IAC 64.33(2)\n\n481 IAC 64.34\n\n481 IAC 65.9(5)\n\n481 IAC 65.15\n\n481 IAC 65.25(3) and (4)\n\n, or the successor to any of such rules; or\n\n42 C.F.R. §483.420(d)\n\n42 C.F.R. §483.460(c)(4)\n\n42 C.F.R. §483.470(j)\n\n, or the successor to any of such federal regulations.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §135C.36; 81 Acts, ch 60, §3]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1168, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 156, §3, 4; 2015 Acts, ch 29, §25; 2015 Acts, ch 80, §2; 2022 Acts, ch 1048, §1\n\nReferred to in §135C.40, 135C.41, 135C.44, 135C.44A, 249A.57",

Additionally, witnesses who have knowledge of facts related to the complaint shall be interviewed, if identifiable and available. The names of witnesses may be obtained from the complainant or the victim. The files of the facility may be reviewed to ascertain the names of staff persons on duty at the time relevant to the complaint. The department shall apply a preponderance of the evidence standard in determining whether or not a complaint is substantiated. For the purposes of this subsection, “a preponderance of the evidence standard” means that the evidence, considered and compared with the evidence opposed to it, produces the belief in a reasonable mind that the allegations are more likely true than not true. “A preponderance of the evidence standard” does not require that the investigator personally witnessed the alleged violation.\n\nc.

Upon conclusion of the investigation, the department shall notify the complainant of the results. The notification shall include a statement of the factual findings as determined by the investigator, the statutory or regulatory provisions alleged to have been violated, and a summary of the reasons for which the complaint was or was not substantiated.\n\nc. The department shall mail the notification to the complainant without charge. Upon the request of the complainant, the department shall mail to the complainant, without charge, a copy of the most recent final findings regarding compliance with licensing requirements by the facility against which the complaint was filed.\n\nd. A person who is dissatisfied with any aspect of the department’s handling of the complaint may contact the office of long-term care ombudsman, or may contact the protection and advocacy agency designated pursuant to section 135C.2 if the complaint relates to a resident with a developmental disability or a mental illness.\n\n3. An inspection made pursuant to a complaint filed under section 135C.37 need not be limited to the matter or matters included in the complaint. However, the inspection shall not be a general inspection unless the complaint inspection coincides with a scheduled general inspection or unless in the course of the complaint investigation a violation is evident to the inspector. Upon arrival at the facility to be inspected, the inspector shall show identification to the person in charge of the facility and state that an inspection is to be made, before beginning the inspection. Upon request of either the complainant or the department or a representative of the office of long-term care ombudsman, the complainant or the complainant’s representative or both may be allowed the privilege of accompanying the inspector during any on-site inspection made pursuant to this section. The inspector may cancel the privilege at any time if the inspector determines that the privacy of any resident of the facility to be inspected would otherwise be violated.
