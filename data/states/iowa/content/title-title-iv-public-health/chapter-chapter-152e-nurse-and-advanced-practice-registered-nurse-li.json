In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\n10. Article X — Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment.\n\na. This compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative enactment of this compact into law by no less than twenty-six states or December 31, 2018. All party states to this compact, that also were parties to the prior nurse licensure compact, superseded by this compact, shall be deemed to have withdrawn from said prior compact within six months after the effective date of this compact.\n\nb. Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the prior nurse licensure compact until such party state has withdrawn from the prior nurse licensure compact.\n\nc. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\nd.

      "text": "152E.3 Form of advanced practice registered nurse compact.\n\nThe advanced practice registered nurse compact is entered into and enacted into law with all jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:\n\n1. Article I — Findings and declaration of purpose.\n\na. The party states find all of the following:\n\n(1) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice laws.\n\n(2) Violations of advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public.\n\n(3) The expanded mobility of advanced practice registered nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation’s health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements.\n\n(4) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements difficult and complex.\n\n(5) The current system of duplicative advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements for advanced practice registered nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant to both advanced practice registered nurses and states.\n\n(6) Uniformity of advanced practice registered nurse requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.\n\n(7) Access to advanced practice registered nurse services increases the public’s access to health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n\nb. The general purposes of this compact are to:\n\n(1) Facilitate the states’ responsibilities to protect the public’s health and safety.\n\n(2) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements including promotion of uniform licensure requirements.\n\n(3) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of advanced practice registered nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions.\n\n(4) Promote compliance with the laws governing advanced practice registered nurse practice in each jurisdiction.\n\n(5) Invest all party states with the authority to hold an advanced practice registered nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses.\n\n2. Article II — Definitions. As used in this compact:\n\na. “Advanced practice registered nurse” means a nurse anesthetist, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, or clinical nurse specialist to the extent a party state licenses or grants authority to practice in that advanced practice registered nurse role and title.\n\nb. “Advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements” means the regulatory mechanism used by a party state to grant legal authority to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse.\n\nc. “Advanced practice registered nurse uniform license or authority to practice requirements” means those minimum uniform licensure, education, and examination requirements as agreed to by the compact administrators and adopted by licensing boards for the recognized advanced practice registered nurse role and title.\n\nd. “Adverse action” means a home or remote state action.\n\ne. “Alternative program” means a voluntary, nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by a nurse licensing board.\n\nf. “Coordinated licensure information system” means an integrated process for collecting, storing, and sharing information on advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice and enforcement activities related to advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice laws, which is administered by a nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by state licensing boards.\n\ng. “Current significant investigative information” means either of the following:\n\n(1) Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the advanced practice registered nurse to respond if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction.\n\n(2) Investigative information that indicates that the advanced practice registered nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the advanced practice registered nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.\n\nh. “Home state” means the party state that is the advanced practice registered nurse’s primary state of residence.\n\ni. “Home state action” means any administrative, civil, equitable, criminal, or other action permitted by the home state’s laws which is imposed on an advanced practice registered nurse by the home state’s licensing board or other authority, including actions against an individual’s license or authority to practice such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action which affects an advanced practice registered nurse’s authorization to practice.\n\nj. “Licensing board” means a party state’s regulatory body responsible for advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice.\n\nk. “Multistate advanced practice privilege” means current authority from a remote state permitting an advanced practice registered nurse to practice in that state in the same role and title as the advanced practice registered nurse is licensed or authorized to practice in the home state to the extent that the remote state laws recognize such advanced practice registered nurse role and title. A party state has the authority, in accordance with existing state due process laws, to take action against the advanced practice registered nurse’s privilege, including revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action that affects an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate privilege to practice.\n\nl. “Party state” means any state that has adopted this compact.\n\nm. “Prescriptive authority” means the legal authority to prescribe medications and devices as defined by party state laws.\n\nn. “Remote state” means a party state, other than the home state, where either of the following applies:\n\n(1) Where the patient is located at the time advanced practice registered nurse care is provided.\n\n(2) In the case of advanced practice registered nurse practice not involving a patient, in such party state where the recipient of advanced practice registered nurse care is located.\n\no. “Remote state action” means either of the following:\n\n(1) Any administrative, civil, equitable, criminal, or other action permitted by a remote state’s laws which is imposed on an advanced practice registered nurse by the remote state’s licensing board or other authority, including actions against an individual’s multistate advanced practice privilege in the remote state.\n\n(2) Cease and desist and other injunctive or equitable orders issued by remote states or the licensing boards of remote states.\n\np. “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nq. “State practice laws” means a party state’s laws and regulations that govern advanced practice registered nurse practice, define the scope of advanced nursing practice, including prescriptive authority, and create the methods and grounds for imposing discipline. “State practice laws” does not include the requirements necessary to obtain and retain advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse, except for qualifications or requirements of the home state.\n\nr. “Unencumbered” means that a state has no current disciplinary action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s license or authority to practice.\n\n3. Article III — General provisions and jurisdiction.\n\na. All party states shall participate in the nurse licensure compact for registered nurses and licensed practical or vocational nurses in order to enter into the advanced practice registered nurse compact.\n\nb. A state shall not enter the advanced practice registered nurse compact until the state adopts, at a minimum, the advanced practice registered nurse uniform license or authority to practice requirements for each advanced practice registered nurse role and title recognized by the state seeking to enter the advanced practice registered nurse compact.\n\nc. Advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice issued by a home state to a resident in that state shall be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate advanced practice privilege to the extent that the role and title are recognized by each party state. To obtain or retain advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements as an advanced practice registered nurse, an applicant must meet the home state’s qualifications for authority or renewal of authority as well as all other applicable state laws.\n\nd. The advanced practice registered nurse multistate advanced practice privilege does not include prescriptive authority, and does not affect any requirements imposed by states to grant to an advanced practice registered nurse initial and continuing prescriptive authority according to state practice laws. However, a party state may grant prescriptive authority to an individual on the basis of a multistate advanced practice privilege to the extent permitted by state practice laws.\n\ne. A party state may, in accordance with state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate advanced practice privilege in the party state and may take any other necessary actions under the party state’s applicable laws to protect the health and safety of the party state’s citizens. If a party state takes action, the party state shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.\n\nf. An advanced practice registered nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the patient is located at the time care is provided. The advanced practice registered nurse practice includes patient care and all advanced nursing practice defined by the party state’s practice laws. The advanced practice registered nurse practice subjects an advanced practice registered nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state.\n\ng. Individuals not residing in a party state may apply for an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse under the laws of a party state. However, the authority to practice granted to these individuals shall not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in any other party state unless explicitly agreed to by that party state.\n\n4. Article IV — Applications for advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice in a party state.\n\na. (1) Once an application for an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice is submitted, a party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has held, or is the holder of, a nursing license or authority to practice issued by another state, whether the applicant has had a history of previous disciplinary action by any state, whether an encumbrance exists on any license or authority to practice, and whether any other adverse action by any other state has been taken against a license or authority to practice.\n\n(2) This information may be used in approving or denying an application for an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice.\n\nb. An advanced practice registered nurse in a party state shall hold an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice in only one party state at a time, issued by the home state.\n\nc. An advanced practice registered nurse who intends to change the nurse’s primary state of residence may apply for an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice in the new home state in advance of such change. However, a new license or authority to practice shall not be issued by a party state until after an advanced practice registered nurse provides evidence of change in the nurse’s primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home state’s licensing board.\n\nd. (1) If an advanced practice registered nurse changes the nurse’s primary state of residence by moving between two party states, and obtains an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice from the new home state, the advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice from the former home state is no longer valid.\n\n(2) If an advanced practice registered nurse changes the nurse’s primary state of residence by moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains an advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice from the new home state, the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and shall remain in full force if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state.\n\n(3) If an advanced practice registered nurse changes the nurse’s primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice issued by the prior home state converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate licensure privilege to practice in other party states.\n\n5. Article V — Adverse actions. In addition to the general provisions described in article III, the following provisions apply:\n\na. The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions, including the factual and legal basis for such action, if known. The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such reports.\n\nb. The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending investigations for an advanced practice registered nurse who changes the nurse’s primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. It shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.\n\nc. A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate advanced practice privilege to practice within that party state. However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the advanced practice registered nurse license or authority to practice issued by the home state.\n\nd. For purposes of imposing adverse action, the licensing board of the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.\n\ne. The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, so long as each state follows its own procedures for imposing such adverse action.\n\nf. Nothing in this compact shall override a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the party state’s laws. Party states must require advanced practice registered nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other party state.\n\ng. All home state licensing board disciplinary orders, agreed to or otherwise, which limit the scope of the advanced practice registered nurse’s practice or require monitoring of the advanced practice registered nurse as a condition of the order shall include the requirements that the advanced practice registered nurse will limit the nurse’s practice to the home state during the pendency of the order. This requirement may allow the advanced practice registered nurse to practice in other party states with prior written authorization from both the home state and party state licensing boards.\n\n6. Article VI — Additional authorities invested in party state licensing boards. Notwithstanding any other powers, party state licensing boards shall have the authority to do all of the following:\n\na. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected advanced practice registered nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that advanced practice registered nurse.\n\nb. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations which require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of evidence from another party state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence is located.\n\nc. Issue cease and desist orders to limit or revoke an advanced practice registered nurse’s privilege, license, or authority to practice in the state.\n\nd. Promulgate uniform rules and regulations as provided for in article VIII, paragraph “c”.\n\n7. Article VII — Coordinated licensure information system.\n\na. All party states shall participate in a cooperative effort to create a coordinated database of all advanced practice registered nurses. This system shall include information on the advanced practice registered nurse licensure and practice requirements and disciplinary history of each advanced practice registered nurse, as contributed by party states, to assist in the coordination of the advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice and enforcement efforts.\n\nb. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states’ licensing boards shall promptly report adverse actions, actions against multistate advanced practice privileges, any current significant investigative information yet to result in adverse action, denials of applications, and the reasons for such denials, to the coordinated licensure information system.\n\nc. Current significant investigative information shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.\n\nd. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states’ licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.\n\ne. Any personally identifiable information obtained by a party state’s licensing board from the coordinated licensure information system shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.\n\nf. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.\n\ng. The compact administrators, acting jointly with each other and in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.\n\n8. Article VIII — Compact administration and interchange of information.\n\na. The head of the licensing board, or the head’s designee, of each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for the head’s state.\n\nb. The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish to the compact administrator of each other party state any information and documents including but not limited to a uniform data set of investigations, identifying information, licensure data, and disclosable alternative program participation information to facilitate the administration of this compact.\n\nc. Compact administrators shall have the authority to develop uniform rules to facilitate and coordinate implementation of this compact. These uniform rules shall be adopted by party states, under the authority invested under article VI, paragraph “d”.\n\n9. Article IX — Immunity. A party state or the officers or employees or agents of a party state’s licensing board who act in accordance with the provisions of this compact shall not be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith while engaged in the performance of their duties under this compact. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.\n\n10. Article X — Entry into force, withdrawal, and amendment.\n\na. This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has been enacted into the laws of that state. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but such withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states.\n\nb. Withdrawal shall not affect the validity or applicability by the licensing boards of states remaining party to the compact of any report of adverse action occurring prior to the withdrawal.\n\nc. This compact shall not be construed to invalidate or prevent any advanced practice registered nurse licensure or authority to practice agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.\n\nd. This compact may be amended by the party states. An amendment to this compact shall not become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.\n\n11. Article XI — Construction and severability.\n\na. This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the compact. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or the applicability of the compact to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the compact to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected by that action. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state which is party to the compact, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nb. (1) In the event party states find a need for settling disputes arising under this compact, the party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel which shall be comprised of an individual appointed by the compact administrator in the home state, an individual appointed by the compact administrator in the remote state or states involved, and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.\n\n(2) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 53, §9; 2007 Acts, ch 22, §38; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201\n\nReferred to in §147.2, 147.5, 147.7, 152.6, 152.7, 152.8, 152.10, 152E.2, 272C.6",
