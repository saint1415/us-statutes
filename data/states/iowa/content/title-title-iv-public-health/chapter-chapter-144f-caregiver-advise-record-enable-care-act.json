A legal representative who is an agent under a durable power of attorney for health care pursuant to chapter 144B shall be given the opportunity to designate a lay caregiver in lieu of the patient’s designation of a lay caregiver only if, consistent with chapter 144B, in the judgment of the attending physician or attending physician assistant, the patient is unable to make the health care decision. A legal representative who is a guardian shall be given the opportunity to designate a lay caregiver in lieu of the patient’s designation of a lay caregiver to the extent consistent with the powers and duties granted the guardian pursuant to sections 232D.401 and 232D.402 or section 633.635.\n\n2.
