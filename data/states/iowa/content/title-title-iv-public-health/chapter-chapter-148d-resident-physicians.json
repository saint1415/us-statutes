The head of the department of family practice in the college of medicine shall determine where affiliated residency programs shall be established, giving consideration to communities in the state where the population, hospital facilities, number of physicians and interest in medical education indicate the potential success of the residency programs. The medical education systems shall provide financial support for residents in training in accredited affiliated residency programs and shall establish positions for a director, assistant director, and other faculty in the programs.\n\n2. To assure continued growth, development, and academic essentials in ongoing programs, nonaffiliated residency programs which are accredited by a recognized national accrediting organization, shall be funded under this chapter at a level commensurate with the support of the affiliated residency programs having a comparable number of residents in training or, if there are no affiliated residency programs having a comparable number of residents in training, then a nonaffiliated program shall be funded in an amount determined on a pro rata capitation basis for each resident in training, equivalent to the per capita funding for each resident in training in an affiliated program having the nearest number of residents in training. As used in this subsection, “support” means both cash grants and the value of service directly provided to affiliated residency programs by the college of medicine.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, §148C.2; C81, §148D.2]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1134, §30; 2018 Acts, ch 1041, §47",
