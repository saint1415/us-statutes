A person shall not discriminate against any individual in any way, including but not limited to employment, promotion, advancement, transfer, licensing, education, training or the granting of hospital privileges or staff appointments, because of the individual’s participation in or refusal to participate in recommending, performing, or assisting in an abortion procedure. For the purposes of this chapter, “abortion” means the termination of a human pregnancy with the intent other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus. Abortion does not include medical care which has as its primary purpose the treatment of a serious physical condition requiring emergency medical treatment necessary to save the life of a mother.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §146.1]\n\nReferred to in §146D.1, 707.8A",
