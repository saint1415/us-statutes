Trauma is a serious health problem in the state of Iowa and is the leading cause of death of younger Iowans. The death and disability associated with traumatic injury contributes to the significant medical expenses and lost work, and adversely affects the productivity of Iowans.\n\n2. Optimal trauma care is limited in many parts of the state. With health care delivery in transition, access to quality trauma and emergency medical care continues to challenge our rural communities.\n\n3. The goal of a statewide trauma care system is to coordinate the medical needs of the injured person with an integrated system of optimal and cost-effective trauma care. The result of a well-coordinated statewide trauma care system is to reduce the incidences of inadequate trauma care and preventable deaths, minimize human suffering, and decrease the costs associated with preventable mortality and morbidity.\n\n4. The development of the Iowa trauma care system will achieve these goals while meeting the unique needs of the rural residents of the state.\n\n95 Acts, ch 40, §3",
