At a commitment hearing, evidence in support of the contentions made in the application may be presented by the applicant, or by an attorney for the applicant, or by the county attorney. During the hearing, the applicant and the respondent shall be afforded an opportunity to testify and to present and cross-examine witnesses, and the court may receive the testimony of other interested persons. If the respondent is present at the hearing, as provided in subsection 3, and has been medicated within twelve hours, or a longer period of time as the court may designate, prior to the beginning of the hearing or a session of the hearing, the court shall be informed of that fact and of the probable effects of the medication upon convening of the hearing.\n\n2. A person not necessary for the conduct of the hearing shall be excluded, except that the court may admit a person having a legitimate interest in the hearing. Upon motion of the applicant, the court may exclude the respondent from the hearing during the testimony of a witness if the court determines that the witness’ testimony is likely to cause the respondent severe emotional trauma.\n\n3. The person who filed the application and a licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor certified by the nongovernmental Iowa board of certification who has examined the respondent in connection with the commitment hearing shall be present at the hearing, unless the court for good cause finds that their presence or testimony is not necessary. The applicant, respondent, and the respondent’s attorney may waive the presence, televised appearance, or telephonic appearance of the licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor who examined the respondent and agree to submit as evidence the written report of the licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor. The respondent’s attorney shall inform the court if the respondent’s attorney reasonably believes that the respondent, due to diminished capacity, cannot make an adequately considered waiver decision. “Good cause” for finding that the testimony of the licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor who examined the respondent is not necessary may include but is not limited to such a waiver. If the court determines that the testimony of the licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor is necessary, the court may allow the licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or certified alcohol and drug counselor to testify by telephone or televised means. The respondent shall be present at the hearing unless prior to the hearing the respondent’s attorney stipulates in writing that the attorney has conversed with the respondent, and that in the attorney’s judgment the respondent cannot make a meaningful contribution to the hearing, or that the respondent has waived the right to be present, and the basis for the attorney’s conclusions.

The hearing may be held by video or telephone conference at the discretion of the court. Discovery as permitted under the Iowa rules of civil procedure is available to the respondent. The court shall receive all relevant and material evidence, but the court is not bound by the rules of evidence. A presumption in favor of the respondent exists, and the burden of evidence and support of the contentions made in the application shall be upon the person who filed the application. If upon completion of the hearing the court finds that the contention that the respondent is a person with a substance use disorder has not been sustained by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall deny the application and terminate the proceeding.\n\n5. If the respondent is not taken into custody under section 125.81, but the court finds good cause to believe that the respondent is about to depart from the jurisdiction of the court, the court may order limited detention of the respondent as authorized in section 125.81, as is necessary to ensure that the respondent will not depart from the jurisdiction of the court without the court’s approval until the proceeding relative to the respondent has been concluded.\n\n[C75, 77, §125.19(3-7, 10, 13); C79, 81, §229.52(1); 82 Acts, ch 1212, §10]\n\n90 Acts, ch 1085, §16; 91 Acts, ch 108, §3; 2006 Acts, ch 1115, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1116, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1159, §30; 2011 Acts, ch 121, §46, 62; 2017 Acts, ch 34, §8; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §44; 2018 Acts, ch 1056, §3; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §118; 2023 Acts, ch 139, §1, 2\n\nReferred to in §125.84, 229.21, 602.8103\n\nSee Code editor’s note on simple harmonization at the beginning of this Code volume\n\nSubsections 3 and 4 amended",

The report shall be submitted in the manner required by section 125.84, shall state whether in the opinion of the chief medical officer or the psychiatrist or psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner the respondent’s condition has improved, remains unchanged, or has deteriorated, and shall indicate the further length of time the respondent will require treatment by the facility. If the respondent fails or refuses to submit to treatment as ordered by the court, the administrator of the facility shall at once notify the court, which shall order the respondent committed for treatment as provided by section 125.84, subsection 3, unless the court finds that the failure or refusal was with good cause, and that the respondent is willing to receive treatment as provided in the court’s order, or in a revised order if the court sees fit to enter one. If the administrator of the facility reports to the court that the respondent requires full-time custody, care, and treatment in a facility, and the respondent is willing to be admitted voluntarily to the facility for these purposes, the court may enter an order approving the placement upon consultation with the administrator of the facility in which the respondent is to be placed. If the respondent is unwilling to be admitted voluntarily to the facility, the procedure for determining involuntary commitment, as provided in section 125.84, subsection 3, shall be followed.\n\n3. a. A psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner treating a respondent previously committed under this chapter may complete periodic reports pursuant to this section on the respondent if the respondent has been recommended for treatment on an outpatient or other appropriate basis pursuant to section 125.84, subsection 3, and if a psychiatrist licensed pursuant to chapter 148 personally evaluates the respondent on at least an annual basis.\n\nb. An advanced registered nurse practitioner who is not certified as a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner but who meets the qualifications of a mental health professional may complete periodic reports pursuant to paragraph “a”.\n\n[82 Acts, ch 1212, §14]\n\n2008 Acts, ch 1082, §2, 3; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §29; 2013 Acts, ch 90, §25; 2017 Acts, ch 34, §9\n\nReferred to in §125.83A, 229.21, 321J.3, 462A.14",

The procedure prescribed by this section shall only be used for a person with a substance use disorder due to intoxication or substance-induced incapacitation who has threatened, attempted, or inflicted physical self-harm or harm on another, and is likely to inflict physical self-harm or harm on another unless immediately detained, or who is incapacitated by a substance, if an application has not been filed naming the person as the respondent pursuant to section 125.75 and the person cannot be ordered into immediate custody and detained pursuant to section 125.81.\n\n2. a. A peace officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the circumstances described in subsection 1 are applicable may, without a warrant, take or cause that person to be taken to the nearest available facility referred to in section 125.81, subsection 2, paragraph “b” or “c”. Such a person with a substance use disorder due to intoxication or substance-induced incapacitation who also demonstrates a significant degree of distress or dysfunction may also be delivered to a facility by someone other than a peace officer upon a showing of reasonable grounds. Upon delivery of the person to a facility under this section, the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon may order treatment of the person, but only to the extent necessary to preserve the person’s life or to appropriately control the person’s behavior if the behavior is likely to result in physical injury to the person or others if allowed to continue. The peace officer or other person who delivered the person to the facility shall describe the circumstances of the matter to the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon. If the person is a peace officer, the peace officer may do so either in person or by written report.\n\nb. If the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon has reasonable grounds to believe that the circumstances in subsection 1 are applicable, the facility shall have the authority to detain the person for a period of no longer than twelve hours. Within twelve hours of detaining a person pursuant to this section, the attending physician shall communicate with the nearest available magistrate.\n\nc. Once contacted pursuant to paragraph “b”, the magistrate shall, based upon the circumstances described by the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, give the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon oral instructions either directing that the person be released forthwith, or authorizing the person’s detention in an appropriate facility. The magistrate may also give oral instructions and order that the detained person be transported to an appropriate facility.\n\nd. If the magistrate orders that the person be detained, the magistrate shall, by the close of business on the next working day, file a written order with the clerk in the county where it is anticipated that an application may be filed under section 125.75. The order may be filed by facsimile if necessary. The order shall state the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody or otherwise brought to a facility and the grounds supporting the finding of probable cause to believe that the person is a person with a substance use disorder likely to result in physical injury to the person or others if not detained. The order shall confirm the oral order authorizing the person’s detention including any order given to transport the person to an appropriate facility. The clerk shall provide a copy of that order to the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon at the facility to which the person was originally taken, any subsequent facility to which the person was transported, and to any law enforcement department or ambulance service that transported the person pursuant to the magistrate’s order.\n\n3. The attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon shall examine and may detain the person pursuant to the magistrate’s order for a period not to exceed forty-eight hours from the time the order is dated, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, unless the order is dismissed by a magistrate. The facility may provide treatment which is necessary to preserve the person’s life or to appropriately control the person’s behavior if the behavior is likely to result in physical injury to the person or others if allowed to continue or is otherwise deemed medically necessary by the attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon or mental health professional, but shall not otherwise provide treatment to the person without the person’s consent. The person shall be discharged from the facility and released from detention no later than the expiration of the forty-eight-hour period, unless an application for involuntary commitment is filed with the clerk pursuant to section 125.75. The detention of a person by the procedure in this section, and not in excess of the period of time prescribed by this section, shall not render the peace officer, attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, or facility detaining the person liable in a criminal or civil action for false arrest or false imprisonment if the peace officer, attending physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon, mental health professional, or facility had reasonable grounds to believe that the circumstances described in subsection 1 were applicable.\n\n4. The cost of detention in a facility under the procedure prescribed in this section shall be paid in the same way as if the person had been committed to the facility pursuant to an application filed under section 125.75.\n\n[C75, 77, §125.17, 125.18; C79, 81, §125.34(4), 125.35; 82 Acts, ch 1212, §19]\n\n90 Acts, ch 1085, §19; 2003 Acts, ch 68, §1, 2; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §188; 2011 Acts, ch 121, §50, 62; 2012 Acts, ch 1021, §44; 2012 Acts, ch 1079, §2; 2017 Acts, ch 34, §10; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §45; 2022 Acts, ch 1071, §3; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §123\n\nReferred to in §125.12, 125.34, 125.44, 125.92, 229.21, 331.910, 602.6405\n\nSection amended",
