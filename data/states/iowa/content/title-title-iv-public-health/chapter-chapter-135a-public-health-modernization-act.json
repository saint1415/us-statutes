A governmental public health system fund is created as a separate fund in the state treasury under the control of the department. The fund shall consist of moneys obtained from any source, including the federal government, unless otherwise prohibited by law or the entity providing the funding. Moneys deposited in the fund are appropriated to the department for the public health purposes specified in this chapter. Moneys in the fund shall not be transferred, used, obligated, appropriated, or otherwise encumbered except as provided in this section. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in the governmental public health system fund at the end of the fiscal year shall not revert to any other fund but shall remain in the fund for subsequent fiscal years.\n\n2. The fund is established to assist local boards of health and the department with the provision of governmental public health system organizational capacity and public health service delivery and to achieve and maintain voluntary accreditation. At least seventy percent of the funds shall be made available to local boards of health and up to thirty percent of the funds may be utilized by the department.\n\n3. Moneys in the fund may be allocated by the department to a local board of health for organizational capacity and service delivery. Such allocation may be made on a matching, dollar-for-dollar basis for the acquisition of equipment, or by providing grants to achieve and maintain voluntary accreditation.\n\n4. A local board of health seeking matching funds or grants under this section shall apply to the department. The council on health and human services shall adopt rules concerning the application and award process for the allocation of moneys in the fund and shall establish the criteria for the allocation of moneys in the fund if the moneys are insufficient to meet the needs of local boards of health.\n\n2009 Acts, ch 182, §122, 126; 2016 Acts, ch 1026, §4; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §161\n\nSubsection 4 amended",
