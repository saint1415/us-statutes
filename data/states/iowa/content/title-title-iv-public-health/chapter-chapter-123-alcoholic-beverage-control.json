When a retail alcohol license is suspended after a hearing as a result of violations of this chapter by the licensee or the licensee’s agents or employees, the premises which were licensed by the license shall not be relicensed for a new applicant until the suspension has terminated or time of suspension has elapsed, or ninety days have elapsed since the commencement of the suspension, whichever occurs first. However, this section does not prohibit the premises from being relicensed to a new applicant before the suspension has terminated or before the time of suspension has elapsed or before ninety days have elapsed from the commencement of the suspension, if the premises prior to the time of the suspension had been purchased under contract, and the vendor under that contract had exercised the person’s rights under chapter 656 and sold the property to a different person who is not related to the previous licensee by marriage or within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity and if the previous licensee does not have a financial interest in the business of the new applicant.\n\n4.

A person other than a person required to hold a license or permit under this chapter who dispenses or gives an alcoholic beverage in violation of this subsection is not civilly liable to an injured person or the estate of a person for injuries inflicted on that person as a result of intoxication by the consumer of the alcoholic beverage.\n\nb. The general assembly declares that this subsection shall be interpreted so that the holding of Clark v. Mincks, 364 N.W.2d 226 (Iowa 1985) is abrogated in favor of prior judicial interpretation finding the consumption of alcoholic beverages rather than the serving of alcoholic beverages as the proximate cause of injury inflicted upon another by an intoxicated person.\n\n2. A person holding a retail alcohol license under this chapter, and the person’s agents or employees, shall not do any of the following:\n\na. Knowingly permit any gambling, except in accordance with chapter 99B, 99D, 99F, or 99G, or knowingly permit solicitation for immoral purposes, or immoral or disorderly conduct on the premises covered by the license.\n\nb. Sell or dispense any alcoholic beverage on the premises covered by the license, or permit its consumption thereon between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on any day of the week.\n\nc. Sell alcoholic beverages to any person on credit, except with a bona fide credit card. This provision does not apply to sales by a club to its members, to sales by a hotel or motel to bona fide registered guests, nor to retail sales by the managing entity of a convention center, civic center, or events center.\n\nd. (1) Keep on premises covered by a retail alcohol license any alcoholic liquor in any container except the original package purchased from the department, and except mixed drinks or cocktails mixed on the premises for immediate consumption on the licensed premises or as otherwise provided by this paragraph “d”. This prohibition does not apply to holders of a class “D” retail alcohol license or to alcoholic liquor delivered in accordance with section 123.46A.\n\n(2) Mixed drinks or cocktails mixed on the premises that are not for immediate consumption may be consumed on the licensed premises subject to the requirements of this subparagraph pursuant to rules adopted by the department. The rules shall provide that the mixed drinks or cocktails be stored, for no longer than seventy-two hours, in a labeled container in a quantity that does not exceed three gallons. The rules shall also provide that added flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients included in the mixed drinks or cocktails shall not include hallucinogenic substances or added caffeine or other added stimulants including but not limited to guarana, ginseng, and taurine. The rules shall also require that the licensee keep records as to when the contents in a particular container were mixed and the recipe used for that mixture. In addition, mixed drinks or cocktails mixed on the premises pursuant to this subparagraph may be sold for consumption off the licensed premises as provided in and subject to the requirements of subparagraph (3).\n\n(3) Mixed drinks or cocktails mixed on premises covered by a class “C” retail alcohol license for consumption off the licensed premises may be sold if the mixed drink or cocktail is immediately filled in a sealed container and is promptly taken from the licensed premises prior to consumption of the mixed drink or cocktail. A mixed drink or cocktail that is sold in a sealed container in compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph and rules adopted by the department shall not be deemed an open container subject to the requirements of sections 321.284 and 321.284A if the sealed container is unopened and the seal has not been tampered with, and the contents of the container have not been partially removed.\n\n(4) For purposes of this paragraph:\n\n(a) “Sealed container” means a vessel containing a mixed drink or cocktail that is designed to prevent consumption without removal of a tamper-evident lid, cap, or seal. “Sealed container” does not include a container with a sipping hole or other opening for a straw, a cup made of plastic that is intended for one-time use, or a cup made of paper or polystyrene foam.\n\n(b) “Tamper-evident” means a lid, cap, or seal that visibly demonstrates when a container has been opened.\n\ne. Reuse for packaging alcoholic liquor or wine any container or receptacle used originally for packaging alcoholic liquor or wine; or adulterate, by the addition of any substance, the contents or remaining contents of an original package of an alcoholic liquor or wine; or knowingly possess any original package which has been so reused or adulterated.\n\nf. (1) Employ a person under eighteen years of age in the sale or serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises where sold.\n\n(2) This paragraph shall not apply if the employer has on file written permission from the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a person sixteen or seventeen years of age for the person to sell or serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises where sold. However, a person sixteen or seventeen years of age shall not work in a bar as defined in section 142D.2. The employer shall keep a copy of the written permission on file until the person is either eighteen years of age or no longer engaged in the sale of or serving alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises where sold. If written permission is on file in accordance with this paragraph, a person sixteen or seventeen years of age may sell or serve alcoholic beverages in a restaurant as defined in section 142D.2 during the hours in which the restaurant serves food.\n\n(3) A person sixteen or seventeen years of age shall not sell or serve alcoholic beverages under this paragraph unless at least two employees eighteen years of age or older are physically present in the area where alcoholic beverages are sold or served.\n\n(4) If a person employed under this paragraph reports an incident of workplace harassment to the employer or if the employer otherwise becomes aware of such an incident, the employer shall report the incident to the employee’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian and to the Iowa civil rights commission, which shall determine if any action is necessary or appropriate under chapter 216.\n\n(5) An employer that employs a person under this paragraph shall require the person to attend training on prevention and response to sexual harassment upon commencing employment.\n\n(6) Prior to a person commencing employment under this paragraph, the employer shall notify the employer’s dramshop liability insurer, in a form and time period prescribed by the director, that the employer is employing a person under this paragraph.\n\ng. Allow any person other than the licensee or employees of the licensee to use or keep on the licensed premises any alcoholic liquor in any bottle or other container which is designed for the transporting of such beverages, except as permitted in section 123.95. This paragraph does not apply to the lodging quarters of a hotel or motel holding a retail alcohol license, or to holders of a class “D” retail alcohol license.\n\nh. Sell, give, or otherwise supply any alcoholic beverage to any person, knowing or failing to exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether the person is under legal age, or permit any person, knowing or failing to exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether the person is under legal age, to consume any alcoholic beverage.\n\ni. In the case of a retail wine or beer permittee, knowingly allow the mixing or adding of alcohol or any alcoholic beverage to wine, beer, or any other beverage in or about the permittee’s place of business.\n\nj. Knowingly permit or engage in any criminal activity on the premises covered by the license. However, the absence of security personnel on the licensed premises is insufficient, without additional evidence, to prove that criminal activity occurring on the licensed premises was knowingly permitted in violation of this paragraph “j”. For purposes of this paragraph “j”, “premises” includes parking lots and areas adjacent to the premises of a retail alcohol licensee authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises and used by patrons of the retail alcohol licensee.\n\nk.

A person who violates section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “h”, commits a simple misdemeanor punishable as a scheduled violation under section 805.8C, subsection 2.\n\n2. The conviction of any retail alcohol licensee for a violation of any of the provisions of section 123.49, subject to subsection 3 of this section, is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license by the department or the local authority. However, if any retail alcohol licensee is convicted of any violation of section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “a” or “e”, or any retail alcohol licensee, excluding a special class “B” or class “D” retail alcohol licensee, is convicted of a violation of section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “d”, the retail alcohol license shall be revoked and shall immediately be surrendered by the holder, and the bond, if any, of the license holder shall be forfeited to the department. However, the department shall retain only that portion of the bond equal to the amount the department determines the license holder owes the department.\n\n3. If any retail alcohol licensee or employee of a licensee is convicted or found in violation of section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “h”, the director or local authority shall, in addition to criminal penalties fixed for violations by this section, assess a civil penalty as follows:\n\na. A first violation shall subject the licensee to a civil penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars. Failure to pay the civil penalty as ordered under section 123.39 shall result in automatic suspension of the license for a period of fourteen days.\n\nb. A second violation within two years shall subject the licensee to a thirty-day suspension and a civil penalty in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars.\n\nc. A third violation within three years shall subject the licensee to a sixty-day suspension and a civil penalty in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars.\n\nd. A fourth violation within three years shall result in revocation of the license.\n\ne. For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) The date of any violation shall be used in determining the period between violations.\n\n(2) Suspension shall be limited to the specific license for the premises found in violation.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding section 123.40, revocation shall be limited to the specific license found in violation and shall not disqualify a licensee from holding a license at a separate location.\n\n4. In addition to any other penalties imposed under this chapter, the department shall assess a civil penalty up to the amount of five thousand dollars upon a class “E” retail alcohol licensee when the class “E” retail alcohol license is revoked for a violation of section 123.59. Failure to pay the civil penalty as required under this subsection shall result in forfeiture of the bond to the department. However, the department shall retain only that portion of the bond equal to the amount the department determines the license holder owes the department.\n\n5. If an employee of a retail alcohol licensee violates section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “h”, the licensee shall not be assessed a penalty under subsection 3, and the violation shall be deemed not to be a violation of section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “h”, for the purpose of determining the number of violations for which a penalty may be assessed pursuant to subsection 3, if the employee holds a valid certificate of completion of the alcohol compliance employee training program pursuant to section 123.50A at the time of the violation, and if the violation involves selling, giving, or otherwise supplying any alcoholic beverage to a person between the ages of eighteen and twenty years of age. A violation involving a person under the age of eighteen years of age shall not qualify for the bar against assessment of a penalty pursuant to subsection 3, for a violation of section 123.49, subsection 2, paragraph “h”.

Unlawfully discharges a firearm or uses an offensive weapon, as defined in section 724.1, regardless of whether it inflicts injury or death.\n\nb.

A person who willingly joins in or remains a part of a riot need not be the same person for each riot incident.\n\n2. If the county attorney or city attorney for the county or city where the licensed premises is located has reason to believe a public safety nuisance that constitutes a serious threat to the public safety exists, the county attorney or city attorney, or an attorney acting at the direction of the county attorney or city attorney, may file a suit in equity in district court without bond seeking abatement of a public safety nuisance occurring at a premises licensed under this chapter pursuant to the requirements of this section.\n\n3. Upon filing a suit in equity in district court pursuant to subsection 2, the county attorney or city attorney shall notify the director of the action. Upon receiving notice, the director shall issue an order reducing the hours during which alcoholic beverages may be sold or consumed at retail on the licensed premises to between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. each day of the week during the pendency of the action in equity. The county attorney or city attorney shall notify the director of any final action or judgment entered resulting from the action.\n\n4. In an action seeking abatement of a public safety nuisance as provided in this section, evidence of other current violations of this chapter may be received by the court and considered in determining the remedial provisions of any abatement order. In addition, evidence of prior sanctions, violations of law, nuisance behavior, or general reputation relating to the licensed premises may be admissible in determining the reasonableness of remedial provisions of an abatement order. However, evidence of a prior conviction of the licensee, managers, employees, or contemporaneous patrons and guests is not necessary for purposes of considering or issuing an abatement order under this section. In an action under this section, the director may submit to the court a report as evidence on behalf of the department regarding the compliance history of the licensee or permittee for consideration by the court.\n\n5. If the district court finds that a public safety nuisance exists, the court may enter judgment declaring the existence of the nuisance and order such remedial action as the court determines reasonable to abate the nuisance. The abatement order may take the form of an injunction. The duration of an abatement order may be up to two years. Remedial action may include but is not limited to temporary closure of the licensed premises, revocation of the license for such period of time as is consistent with section 123.40, required change in business practice or operations, or posting of a bond. If a bond is ordered and posted, the bond shall be subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, for any further actions contrary to the abatement order.\n\n6.

If the injury was proximately caused by an intoxicated person, a permittee or licensee may establish as an affirmative defense that the intoxication did not contribute to the injurious action of the person.\n\nc. The total amount recoverable by each plaintiff in any civil action for noneconomic damages for personal injury, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, against a licensee or permittee, shall be limited to two hundred fifty thousand dollars for any injury or death of a person, unless the jury determines that there is a substantial or permanent loss or impairment of a bodily function, substantial disfigurement, or death, which warrants a finding that imposition of such a limitation would deprive the plaintiff of just compensation for the injuries sustained.\n\n2. a. Every retail alcohol licensee, except a class “B”, special class “B”, or class “E” retail alcohol licensee, shall furnish proof of financial responsibility by the existence of a liability insurance policy in an amount determined by the department. If an insurer provides dramshop liability insurance at a new location to a licensee or permittee who has a positive loss experience at other locations for which such insurance is provided by the insurer, and the insurer bases premium rates at the new location on the negative loss history of the previous licensee at that location, the insurer shall examine and consider adjusting the premium for the new location not less than thirty months after the insurance is issued, based on the loss experience of the licensee at that location during that thirty-month period of time.\n\nb. A dramshop liability insurance policy may be written on an aggregate limit basis.\n\nc. The purpose of dramshop liability insurance is to provide protection for members of the public who experience damages as a result of licensees serving patrons any alcoholic beverage to a point that reaches or exceeds the standard set forth in law for liability. Minimum coverage requirements for such insurance are not for the purpose of making the insurance affordable for all licensees regardless of claims experience. A dramshop liability insurance policy obtained by a licensee shall meet the minimum insurance coverage requirements as determined by the department and is a mandatory condition for holding a license.\n\n3. a. Notwithstanding section 123.49, subsection 1, any person who is injured in person or property or means of support by an intoxicated person who is under legal age or resulting from the intoxication of a person who is under legal age, has a right of action for all damages actually sustained, severally or jointly, against a person who is not a licensee and who dispensed or gave any alcoholic beverage to the intoxicated underage person when the nonlicensee who dispensed or gave the alcoholic beverage to the underage person knew or should have known the underage person was intoxicated, or who dispensed or gave any alcoholic beverage to the underage person to a point where the nonlicensee knew or should have known that the underage person would become intoxicated.\n\nb. If the injury was caused by an intoxicated person who is under legal age, a person who is not a licensee and who dispensed or gave the alcoholic beverage to the underage person may establish as an affirmative defense that the intoxication did not contribute to the injurious action of the underage person.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection, “dispensed” or “gave” means the act of physically presenting a receptacle containing any alcoholic beverage to the underage person whose actions or intoxication results in the sustaining of damages by another person.
