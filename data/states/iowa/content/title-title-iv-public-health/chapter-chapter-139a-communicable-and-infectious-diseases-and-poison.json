Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if a care provider sustains a significant exposure from an individual while rendering health care services or other services, the individual to whom the care provider was exposed is deemed to consent to a test to determine if the individual has a contagious or infectious disease and is deemed to consent to notification of the care provider of the results of the test, upon submission of a significant exposure report by the care provider to the hospital, clinic, other health facility, or other person specified in this section to whom the individual is delivered by the care provider as determined by rule.\n\nb. The hospital, clinic, or other health facility in which the significant exposure occurred or other person specified in this section to whom the individual is delivered shall conduct the test. If the individual is delivered by the care provider to an institution administered by the Iowa department of corrections, the test shall be conducted by the staff physician of the institution. If the individual is delivered by the care provider to a jail, the test shall be conducted by the attending physician of the jail or the county medical examiner. The sample and test results shall only be identified by a number.\n\nc. A hospital, clinic, or other health facility, institutions administered by the department of corrections, and jails shall have written policies and procedures for notification of a care provider under this section. The policies and procedures shall include designation of a representative of the care provider to whom notification shall be provided and who shall, in turn, notify the care provider. The identity of the designated representative of the care provider shall not be revealed to the individual tested. The designated representative shall inform the hospital, clinic, or other health facility, institution administered by the department of corrections, or jail of those parties who received the notification, and following receipt of this information and upon request of the individual tested, the hospital, clinic, or other health facility, institution administered by the department of corrections, or jail shall inform the individual of the parties to whom notification was provided.\n\nd. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a care provider may transmit cautions regarding contagious or infectious disease information, with the exception of AIDS or HIV pursuant to section 80.9B, in the course of the care provider’s duties over the police radio broadcasting system under chapter 693 or any other radio-based communications system if the information transmitted does not personally identify an individual.\n\n2. a. If the test results are positive, the hospital, clinic, other health facility, or other person performing the test shall notify the subject of the test and make any required reports to the department pursuant to sections 139A.3 and 141A.6. The report to the department shall include the name of the individual tested.\n\nb. If the individual tested is diagnosed or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease, the hospital, clinic, other health facility, or other person conducting the test shall notify the care provider or the designated representative of the care provider who shall then notify the care provider.\n\nc. The notification to the care provider shall be provided as soon as is reasonably possible following determination that the subject of the test has a contagious or infectious disease. The notification shall not include the name of the individual tested for the contagious or infectious disease unless the individual consents. If the care provider who sustained a significant exposure determines the identity of the individual diagnosed or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease, the identity of the individual shall be confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the care provider to any other person unless a specific written release is obtained from the individual diagnosed with or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease.\n\n3. This section does not preclude a hospital, clinic, other health facility, or a health care provider from providing notification to a care provider under circumstances in which the hospital’s, clinic’s, other health facility’s, or health care provider’s policy provides for notification of the hospital’s, clinic’s, other health facility’s, or health care provider’s own employees of exposure to a contagious or infectious disease that is not life-threatening if the notice does not reveal a patient’s name, unless the patient consents.\n\n4. A hospital, clinic, other health facility, or health care provider, or other person participating in good faith in complying with provisions authorized or required under this section is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed.\n\n5. A hospital’s, clinic’s, other health facility’s, or health care provider’s duty to notify under this section is not continuing but is limited to a diagnosis of a contagious or infectious disease made in the course of admission, care, and treatment following the rendering of health care services or other services to the individual who was the source of the significant exposure.\n\n6. Notwithstanding subsection 5, the hospital, clinic, or other health facility may provide a procedure for notifying the exposed care provider if, following discharge from or completion of care or treatment by the hospital, clinic, or other health facility, the individual who was the source of the significant exposure, and for whom a significant exposure report was submitted that did not result in notification of the exposed care provider, wishes to provide information regarding the source individual’s contagious or infectious disease status to the exposed care provider.\n\n7. A hospital, clinic, other health facility, health care provider, or other person who is authorized to perform a test under this section who performs the test in compliance with this section or who fails to perform the test authorized under this section, is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed.\n\n8. A hospital, clinic, other health facility, health care provider, or other person who is authorized to perform a test under this section has no duty to perform the test authorized.\n\n9. The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to administer this section. The department may determine by rule the contagious or infectious diseases for which testing is reasonable and appropriate and which may be administered under this section.\n\n10. The employer of a care provider who sustained a significant exposure under this section shall pay the costs of testing for the individual who is the source of the significant exposure and of the testing of the care provider, if the significant exposure was sustained during the course of employment. However, the department shall assist an individual who is the source of the significant exposure in finding resources to pay for the costs of the testing and shall assist a care provider who renders direct aid without compensation in finding resources to pay for the cost of the test.\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1066, §19; 2001 Acts, ch 157, §4; 2011 Acts, ch 63, §20; 2011 Acts, ch 131, §54, 158",
