The economic health and development of Iowa communities is tied to opportunities for jobs in and near those communities and the availability of jobs is in part tied to the availability of affordable, decent housing in those communities.\n\nb. A need exists for a program to assist developers and communities in increasing the availability of housing in Iowa communities.\n\nc. A shortage of opportunities and means for developing local housing exists. It is in the best interest of the state and its citizens for infrastructure development which will lower the costs of developing housing.\n\nd. The expansion of local housing is dependent upon the cost of providing the basic infrastructure necessary for a housing development. Providing this infrastructure is a public purpose for which the state may encourage the formation of real estate improvement districts for the purpose of providing water, sewer, roads, and other infrastructure.\n\n2.

The lien shall have equal precedence with ordinary taxes, may be certified to the county treasurer and collected in the same manner as taxes, and is not divested by a judicial sale.\n\n2. Sewer rentals, charges, or rates may supplant or replace, in whole or in part, any monetary levy of taxes which may be, or have been, authorized by the board of trustees for any of the following purposes:\n\na. To meet interest and principal payments on bonds legally authorized for the financing of sanitary utilities in any manner.\n\nb. To pay costs of the construction, maintenance, or repair of the facilities or utilities, including payments to be made under any contract between municipalities for either the joint use of water or sewage facilities, or for the use by one municipality of all or a part of the water or sewer system of another municipality.\n\n95 Acts, ch 200, §15",

      "text": "358C.16 Debt limit — borrowing — bonds — purposes.\n\n1. A district may borrow money for its corporate purposes, but shall not become indebted in any manner or for any purpose to an amount in the aggregate exceeding its constitutional debt limit of five percent on the value of the taxable property within the district, to be ascertained by the last state and county tax lists previous to the incurring of the indebtedness. Indebtedness within this constitutional limit shall not include the indebtedness of any other municipal corporation located wholly or partly within the boundaries of the district, special assessment bonds or obligations authorized under section 358C.17.\n\n2. Subject only to this debt limitation, a district shall have the same powers to issue bonds, including both general obligation and revenue bonds, including the power to enter into short-term loans and issue warrants, which cities have under the laws of this state. In the application of the laws to this chapter, the words used in the laws referring to municipal corporations or to cities shall be held to include real estate improvement districts organized under this chapter; the words “council” or “city council” shall be held to include the board of trustees of a district; the words “mayor” and “clerk” shall be held to include the president and clerk of a board of trustees; and like construction shall be given to any other words in the laws where required to permit the exercise of the powers by real estate improvement districts.\n\n3. All bonds issued shall be signed by the president of the board of trustees and attested by the clerk, with the seal of the district, if any, affixed, and interest coupons attached to the bonds shall be attested by the signature of the clerk.\n\n4. The proceeds of any bond issue made under this section shall be used only for the cost of public improvements as specified in sections 358C.1 and 358C.4. Proceeds from the bond issue may also be used for the payment of special assessment deficiencies. The bonds shall be payable in not more than forty annual installments and with interest at a rate not exceeding that permitted by chapter 74A, and shall be made payable at the place and be of the form as the board of trustees shall by resolution designate. A district issuing bonds as authorized in this section is granted authority to pledge the future avails of a tax levy to the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds after the same come due, and the power to impose and certify the levy is granted to the trustees of real estate improvement districts organized under this chapter.\n\n95 Acts, ch 200, §16; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §6",

The board of trustees of a real estate improvement district may provide for payment of all or any portion of the costs of a public improvement as specified in sections 358C.1 and 358C.4, by assessing all, or any portion of, the costs on adjacent property according to the benefits derived. For the purposes of this chapter, the board of trustees may define “adjacent property” as all that included within a designated benefited district to be fixed by the board, which may be all of the property located within the real estate improvement district or any lesser portion of that property. It is not a valid objection to a special assessment that the improvement for which the assessment is levied is outside the limits of the district, but a special assessment shall not be made upon property situated outside of the district. Special assessments pursuant to this section shall be in proportion to the special benefits conferred upon the property, and not in excess of the benefits. The value of a property is the present fair market value of the property with the proposed public improvements completed. Payment of installments of a special assessment against property shall be made in the same manner and under the same procedures as provided in chapter 384 for special assessments by cities. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 384.62, the combined assessments against any lot for public improvements included in the petition creating the real estate improvement district or as authorized in section 358C.4 shall not exceed the valuation of that lot as established by section 384.46.\n\n2. The assessments may be made to extend over a period not to exceed fifteen years, payable in as nearly equal annual installments as practicable. A majority vote of the board of trustees is requisite and sufficient for any action required by the board of trustees under this section.\n\n3. Subject to the limitations otherwise stated in this section, a district organized under this chapter has all of the powers to specially assess the costs of improvements described in this section, including the power to issue special assessment bonds, warrants, project notes, or other forms of interim financing obligations, which cities have under the laws of this state.\n\n4. A special assessment under this section shall be recorded in the county in which the district is located for each lot in the district.\n\n5. Notwithstanding section 384.65, subsection 5, a district shall have a lien on the benefited property only in the amount of special assessment installments that have come due but have not been paid. The district shall not have a lien for the total amount of the special assessment originally levied against the benefited property. A lien, including, but not limited to, a lien for a mortgage for the construction or the purchase of housing on property benefited by improvements and against which a special assessment is levied under this chapter, shall have precedence over a special assessment which has been levied by the district but is not due. A district’s lien shall only be in the amount of installments whose due dates have passed without payment, along with all interest and penalties on the delinquent installments. The district’s lien for delinquent installments, interest, and penalties shall have equal precedence with ordinary taxes and shall not be divested by judicial sale. Any remaining special assessment installments that have not become due shall not be divested by judicial sale and shall become a lien when the special assessment installments become due.\n\n95 Acts, ch 200, §17; 96 Acts, ch 1034, §33; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §7, 8\n\nReferred to in §358C.16",
