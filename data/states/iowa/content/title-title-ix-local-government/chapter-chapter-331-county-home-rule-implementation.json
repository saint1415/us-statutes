The court shall expedite its review and determination in this matter. The referendum on the proposed charter shall be stayed during pendency of the action and for such additional time during which the proposed charter or its enabling legislation does not conform to the Constitution or laws of the State of Iowa.

A county may, except as expressly limited by the Constitution of the State of Iowa, and if not inconsistent with the laws of the general assembly, exercise any power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the county or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents. This grant of home rule powers does not include the power to enact private or civil law governing civil relationships, except as incident to an exercise of an independent county power.\n\n2. A power of a county is vested in the board, and a duty of a county shall be performed by or under the direction of the board except as otherwise provided by law.\n\n3. The enumeration of a specific power of a county, the repeal of a grant of power, or the failure to state a specific power does not limit or restrict the general grant of home rule power conferred by the Constitution and this section. A county may exercise its general powers subject only to limitations expressly imposed by a state law.\n\n4. An exercise of a county power is not inconsistent with a state law unless it is irreconcilable with the state law.\n\n5. A county shall substantially comply with a procedure established by a state law for exercising a county power unless a state law provides otherwise. If a procedure is not established by state law, a county may determine its own procedure for exercising the power.\n\n6. a. A county shall not set standards and requirements which are lower or less stringent than those imposed by state law, but may set standards and requirements which are higher or more stringent than those imposed by state law, unless a state law provides otherwise.\n\nb. A county shall not impose any fee or charge on any individual or business licensed by the plumbing and mechanical systems board for the right to perform plumbing, mechanical, HVAC, refrigeration, sheet metal, or hydronic systems work within the scope of the license. This paragraph does not prohibit a county from charging fees for the issuance of permits for, and inspections of, work performed in its jurisdiction.\n\nc. (1) A county shall not adopt an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment that sets standards or requirements regarding the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise that are different from, or in addition to, any state law. For purposes of this paragraph:\n\n(a) “Consumer merchandise” means merchandise offered for sale or lease, or provided with a sale or lease, primarily but not exclusively for personal, family, or household purposes, and includes any container used for consuming, carrying, or transporting such merchandise.\n\n(b) “Container” means a bag, cup, package, container, bottle, or other packaging that is all of the following:\n\n(i) Designed to be either reusable or single-use.\n\n(ii) Made of cloth, paper, plastic, including foamed or expanded plastic, cardboard, corrugated material, aluminum, glass, or postconsumer recycled or similar material or substrates, including coated, laminated, or multilayer substrates.\n\n(iii) Designed for consuming, transporting, or protecting merchandise, food, or beverages from or at a food service or retail facility.\n\n(2) An ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment adopted prior to March 30, 2017, that violates this paragraph is void and unenforceable on and after March 30, 2017.\n\n(3) This paragraph “c” shall not apply to county solid waste or recycling collection or county solid waste or recycling programs.\n\nd. A county shall not adopt an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment, or use any other means, that restricts an owner of real property from refinancing existing debt on, selling, or otherwise transferring title to the property by requiring the owner to take or show compliance with any action with respect to the property or pay any fee before, during, or after refinancing existing debt on, selling, or otherwise transferring title to the property.\n\n7. A county shall not levy a tax unless specifically authorized by a state statute.\n\n8. A county is a body corporate for civil and political purposes and shall have a seal as provided in section 331.552, subsection 4.\n\n9. Supervisors and other county officers may administer oaths and take affirmations as provided in chapter 63A.\n\n10. A county may enter into leases or lease-purchase contracts for real or personal property in accordance with the following terms and procedures:\n\na. A county shall lease or lease-purchase property only for a term which does not exceed the economic life of the property, as determined by the board.\n\nb. A lease or lease-purchase contract entered into by a county may contain provisions similar to those sometimes found in leases between private parties, including, but not limited to, the obligation of the lessee to pay any of the costs of operation or ownership of the leased property and the right to purchase the leased property.\n\nc. A provision of a lease or lease-purchase contract which stipulates that a portion of the rent payments be applied as interest is subject to chapter 74A. Other laws relating to interest rates do not apply. Chapter 75 is not applicable. A county enterprise is a separate entity under this subsection, whether it is governed by the board or another governing body.\n\nd. The board must follow substantially the same authorization procedure required for the issuance of general obligation bonds issued for the same purpose to authorize a lease or a lease-purchase contract made payable from the debt service fund.\n\ne. The board may authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract which is payable from the general fund if the contract would not cause the total of lease and lease-purchase payments due from the general fund of the county in any single future fiscal year for all lease or lease-purchase contracts in force on the date of the authorization, excluding payments to exercise purchase options or to pay the expenses of operation or ownership of the property, to exceed ten percent of the last certified general fund budget amount in accordance with the following procedures:\n\n(1) (a) The board must follow substantially the authorization procedures of section 331.443 to authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract for personal property which is payable from the general fund. The board must follow substantially the authorization procedures of section 331.443 to authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract for real property which is payable from the general fund if the principal amount of the lease-purchase contract does not exceed the following limits:\n\n(i) Four hundred thousand dollars in a county having a population of twenty-five thousand or less.\n\n(ii) Five hundred thousand dollars in a county having a population of more than twenty-five thousand but not more than fifty thousand.\n\n(iii) Six hundred thousand dollars in a county having a population of more than fifty thousand but not more than one hundred thousand.\n\n(iv) Eight hundred thousand dollars in a county having a population of more than one hundred thousand but not more than two hundred thousand.\n\n(v) One million dollars in a county having a population of more than two hundred thousand.\n\n(b) However, if the principal amount of a lease or lease-purchase contract pursuant to this subparagraph (1) is less than twenty-five thousand dollars, the board may authorize the lease or lease-purchase contract without following the authorization procedures of section 331.443.\n\n(2) The board must follow the following procedures to authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract for real property which is payable from the general fund if the principal amount of the lease or lease-purchase contract exceeds the limits set forth in subparagraph (1):\n\n(a) The board must institute proceedings for entering into a lease or lease-purchase contract payable from the general fund by causing a notice of the meeting to discuss entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract, including a statement of the principal amount and purpose of the lease or lease-purchase and the right to petition for an election, to be published as provided in section 331.305 at least ten days prior to the discussion meeting. No sooner than thirty days following the discussion meeting shall the board hold a meeting at which it is proposed to take action to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract.\n\n(b) (i) If at any time before the end of the thirty-day period after which a meeting may be held to take action to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract, a petition is filed with the auditor in the manner provided by section 331.306, asking that the question of entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract be submitted to the registered voters of the county, the board shall either by resolution declare the proposal to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract to have been abandoned or shall direct the county commissioner of elections to call a special election upon the question of entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract. However, for purposes of this subparagraph (2), the petition shall not require signatures in excess of one thousand persons.\n\n(ii) The question to be placed on the ballot shall be stated affirmatively in substantially the following manner:\n\nShall the county of ................ enter into a lease or lease-purchase contract in an amount of $ ................ for the purpose of ................?\n\n(iii) Notice of the election and its conduct shall be in the manner provided in section 331.442, subsections 2 through 4.\n\n(c) If a petition is not filed or if a petition is filed and the proposition of entering into a lease or lease-purchase contract is approved at the election, the board may proceed and enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract.\n\nf. The governing body may authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract payable from the net revenues of a county enterprise or combined county enterprise by following the authorization procedures of section 331.464.\n\ng. A lease or lease-purchase contract to which a county is a party or in which a county has a participatory interest is an obligation of a political subdivision of this state for the purposes of chapters 502 and 636, and is a lawful investment for banks, trust companies, savings associations, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, executors, guardians, trustees, and any other fiduciaries responsible for the investment of funds.\n\nh. Property that is lease-purchased by a county is exempt under section 427.1, subsection 2.\n\ni. A contract for construction by a private party of property to be lease-purchased by a county is a contract for a public improvement and is subject to section 331.341, subsection 1.\n\n11. A county may enter into insurance agreements obligating the county to make payments beyond its current budget year to procure or provide for a policy of insurance, a self-insurance program, or a local government risk pool to protect the county against tort liability, loss of property, or any other risk associated with the operation of the county. Such a self-insurance program or local government risk pool is not insurance and is not subject to regulation under chapters 505 through 523C. However, those self-insurance plans regulated pursuant to section 509A.14 shall remain subject to the requirements of section 509A.14 and rules adopted pursuant to that section.\n\n12. The board of supervisors may credit funds to a reserve for the purposes authorized by subsection 11 of this section; section 331.424, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (5); and section 331.441, subsection 2, paragraph “b”. Moneys credited to the reserve, and interest earned on such moneys, shall remain in the reserve until expended for purposes authorized by subsection 11 of this section; section 331.424, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (5); or section 331.441, subsection 2, paragraph “b”.\n\n13. The board of supervisors may waive a tax penalty, interest, or costs related to the collection of a tax if the board finds that a clerical error resulted in the penalty, interest, or cost. This subsection does not apply to bonded special assessments without the approval of the affected taxing jurisdiction.\n\n14. The county may establish a department of public works. The department shall be administered by the county engineer or other person appointed by the board of supervisors. In addition to other duties assigned by the board, the department shall provide technical assistance to political subdivisions in the county including special districts relating to their physical infrastructure and may provide managerial and administrative services for special districts and combined special districts.\n\n15. a. A county may adopt and enforce an ordinance requiring the construction of a storm shelter at a manufactured home community or mobile home park which is constructed after July 1, 1999. In lieu of requiring construction of a storm shelter, a county may require a community or park owner to provide a plan for the evacuation of community or park residents to a safe place of shelter in times of severe weather including tornadoes and high winds if the county determines that a safe place of shelter is available within a reasonable distance of the manufactured home community or mobile home park for use by community or park residents. Each evacuation plan prepared pursuant to this subsection shall be filed with, and approved by, the local emergency management agency. If construction of a storm shelter is required, an ordinance adopted or enforced pursuant to this subsection shall not include any of the following requirements:\n\n(1) That the size of the storm shelter be larger than the equivalent of seven square feet for each manufactured or mobile home space in the manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\n(2) That the storm shelter include a restroom if the shelter is used exclusively as a storm shelter.\n\n(3) That the storm shelter exceed the construction specifications approved by a licensed professional engineer and presented by the owner of the manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\n(4) That the shelter be located any closer than one thousand three hundred twenty feet from any manufactured or mobile home in the manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\nb. For the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) “Manufactured home community” means the same as land-leased community defined in sections 335.30A and 414.28A.\n\n(2) “Manufactured home community or mobile home park” means a manufactured home community or mobile home park as defined in section 562B.7.\n\n(3) “Storm shelter” means a single structure or multiple structures designed to provide persons with temporary protection from a storm.\n\n16. The board of supervisors may by ordinance or resolution prohibit or limit the use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks, as described in section 727.2, if the board determines that the use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or private property, or if the board determines that the use of such devices would constitute a nuisance to neighboring landowners.\n\n17. a. For purposes of this subsection, “short-term rental property” means any individually or collectively owned single-family house or dwelling unit; any unit or group of units in a condominium, cooperative, or timeshare; or an owner-occupied residential home that is offered for a fee for thirty days or less. “Short-term rental property” does not include a unit that is used for any retail, restaurant, banquet space, event center, or other similar use.\n\nb. A county shall not adopt or enforce any regulation, restriction, or other ordinance, including a conditional use permit requirement, relating to short-term rental properties within the county. A short-term rental property shall be classified as a residential land use for zoning purposes.\n\nc. Notwithstanding paragraph “b”, a county may enact or enforce an ordinance that regulates, prohibits, or otherwise limits short-term rental properties for the following primary purposes if enforcement is performed in the same manner as enforcement applicable to similar properties that are not short-term rental properties:\n\n(1) Protection of public health and safety related to fire and building safety, sanitation, or traffic control.\n\n(2) Residential use and zoning purposes related to noise, property maintenance, or nuisance issues.\n\n(3) Limitation or prohibition of use of property to house sex offenders; to manufacture, exhibit, distribute, or sell illegal drugs, liquor, pornography, or obscenity; or to operate an adult-oriented entertainment establishment as described in section 239B.5, subsection 4, paragraph “a”.\n\n(4) To provide the county with an emergency contact for a short-term rental property.\n\nd. A county shall not require a license or permit fee for a short-term rental property in the county.\n\n18. a. A county shall not adopt, enforce, or otherwise administer an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment, or use any other means, to restrict, impede, regulate, or prohibit, intentionally or effectively, any of the following:\n\n(1) The provision of natural gas service by a public utility as defined in section 476.1, a competitive natural gas provider as defined in section 476.86, or a retail propane marketer or retail propane dispenser as those terms are defined in section 101C.2 to a person, business, municipality, or other wholesale or retail customer within or outside the county.\n\n(2) The purchase of natural gas or propane from a competitive natural gas provider as defined in section 476.86 or a retail propane marketer or retail propane dispenser as those terms are defined in section 101C.2, or the receipt of natural gas or propane service from a public utility as defined in section 476.1, by any person, business, municipality, or other wholesale or retail customer within or outside the county.\n\nb. Paragraph “a” does not apply to an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment that regulates a retail propane marketer or retail propane dispenser, as those terms are defined in section 101C.2, adopted before July 1, 2021.\n\n19. A county shall not adopt an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment, or use any other means, that requires the owner of real property to implement a policy relating to the use of facial coverings that is more stringent than a policy imposed by the state.\n\n20. A county shall not adopt or enforce an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment imposing any requirement to obtain a permit or license, or to pay a fee, for an eligible business operated on an occasional basis for no more than eighty-nine calendar days in a calendar year by a person or persons under the age of eighteen. For purposes of this subsection, “eligible business” means an on-site transactional business traditionally operated exclusively by a person under the age of eighteen, including a “stand operated by a minor” as defined in section 137F.1, that a person under the age of eighteen is not otherwise prohibited by law from operating.\n\n21. A county shall not require the payment of a penalty, fine, or fee due to a resident’s noncompliance with rules adopted by the county sanitarian regarding periodic septic tank pumping as part of routine maintenance.\n\n22.

A county shall not adopt or enforce an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment to require energy benchmarking requirements for a private property.\n\n[C51, §93; R60, §221; C73, §279; C97, §394; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §5128; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §332.1; S81, §331.301; 81 Acts, ch 117, §300]\n\n85 Acts, ch 156, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1211, §19; 87 Acts, ch 115, §51; 89 Acts, ch 101, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1138, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1204, §8; 95 Acts, ch 67, §53; 95 Acts, ch 206, §8, 12; 99 Acts, ch 186, §1; 2001 Acts, ch 143, §1; 2001 Acts, ch 153, §9, 16; 2004 Acts, ch 1119, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §93; 2009 Acts, ch 100, §8, 21; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §131, 132, 177; 2011 Acts, ch 100, §13, 15; 2012 Acts, ch 1017, §72; 2013 Acts, ch 77, §33, 36; 2014 Acts, ch 1092, §86; 2017 Acts, ch 20, §1, 5; 2017 Acts, ch 115, §6, 12; 2018 Acts, ch 1013, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1075, §10, 12, 13; 2018 Acts, ch 1172, §71, 72, 74; 2020 Acts, ch 1074, §1, 93; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §147; 2021 Acts, ch 44, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 139, §29, 31; 2021 Acts, ch 179, §1, 3; 2022 Acts, ch 1024, §1; 2022 Acts, ch 1153, §19; 2023 Acts, ch 147, §2\n\nReferred to in §346.27\n\nSee also Iowa Constitution, Art.

      "text": "331.302 County legislation.\n\n1. The board shall exercise a power or perform a duty only by the passage of a motion, a resolution, an amendment, or an ordinance.\n\n2. For a violation of an ordinance a county shall not provide a penalty in excess of the maximum fine and term of imprisonment for a simple misdemeanor under section 903.1, subsection 1, paragraph “a”. The crime services surcharge required by section 911.1 shall be added to a county fine and is not a part of the county’s penalty.\n\n3. The subject matter of an ordinance or amendment shall be generally described in its title.\n\n4. An amendment to an ordinance or to a code of ordinances shall specifically repeal the ordinance or code, or the section, subsection, paragraph, or subpart to be amended, and shall set forth the ordinance, code, section, subsection, paragraph, or subpart as amended.\n\n5. a. A county may by ordinance adopt by reference any portion of the Code of Iowa in effect at the time of the adoption in the manner provided in section 380.8 for adoption of a proposed code of ordinances containing a proposed new ordinance or amendment, subject to the following limitations:\n\n(1) The ordinance shall describe the subject matter and identify the portion of the Code of Iowa adopted by chapter, section, and subsection or other subpart, as applicable.\n\n(2) A portion of the Code of Iowa may be adopted by reference only if the criminal penalty provided by the law adopted does not exceed the maximum fine and term of imprisonment for a simple misdemeanor under section 903.1, subsection 1, paragraph “a”.\n\n(3) Amendments or other changes to those portions of the Code of Iowa which have been adopted by reference shall serve as an automatic modification of the applicable ordinance.\n\nb. An ordinance which adopts by reference any portion of the Code of Iowa may provide that violations of the ordinance are county infractions and subject to the limitations of section 331.307.\n\n6. a. A proposed ordinance or amendment shall be considered and voted on for passage at two meetings of the board prior to the meeting at which it is to be finally passed, unless this requirement is suspended by a recorded vote of not less than a majority of the supervisors.\n\nb. However, if a summary of the proposed ordinance or amendment is published as provided in section 331.305 prior to its first consideration and copies are available at the time of publication at the office of the auditor, the ordinance or amendment shall be considered and voted on for passage at one meeting prior to the meeting at which it is to be finally passed, unless this requirement is suspended by a recorded vote of not less than a majority of the supervisors.\n\n7. Passage of an ordinance, amendment, or resolution requires an affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the supervisors. Each supervisor’s vote on an ordinance, amendment, or resolution shall be recorded.\n\n8. A resolution becomes effective upon passage and an ordinance or amendment becomes a law when a summary of the ordinance or the complete text of the ordinance is published, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the measure. As used in this subsection, “summary” shall mean a narrative description of the terms and conditions of an ordinance setting forth the main points of the ordinance in a manner calculated to inform the public in a clear and understandable manner the meaning of the ordinance and which shall provide the public with sufficient notice to conform to the desired conduct required by the ordinance. The description shall include the title of the ordinance, an accurate and intelligible abstract or synopsis of the essential elements of the ordinance, a statement that the description is a summary, the location and the normal business hours of the office where the ordinance may be inspected, when the ordinance becomes effective, and the full text of any provisions imposing fines, penalties, forfeitures, fees, or taxes. Legal descriptions of property set forth in ordinances shall be described in full, provided that maps or charts may be substituted for legal descriptions when they contain sufficient detail to clearly define the area with which the ordinance is concerned. The narrative description shall be written in a clear and coherent manner and shall, to the extent possible, avoid the use of technical or legal terms not generally familiar to the public. When necessary to use technical or legal terms not generally familiar to the public, the narrative description shall include definitions of those terms.\n\n9. The auditor shall promptly record each measure, publish a summary of all ordinances or a complete text of the ordinances and amendments as provided in section 331.305, authenticate all measures except motions with signature and certification as to time and manner of publication, if any, and maintain for public use copies of all effective ordinances and codes. A copy of the complete text of an ordinance or amendment shall also be available for distribution to the public at the office of the county auditor. The auditor’s certification is presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein.\n\n10. a. At least once every five years, the board shall compile a code of ordinances containing all of the county ordinances in effect.\n\n(1) If a proposed code of ordinances contains only existing ordinances edited and compiled without change in substance, the board may adopt the code by ordinance.\n\n(2) If a proposed code of ordinances contains a proposed new ordinance or amendment, the board shall hold a public hearing on the proposed code before adoption. The auditor shall publish notice of the hearing as provided in section 331.305. Copies of the proposed code of ordinances shall be available at the auditor’s office and the notice shall so state. Within thirty days after the hearing, the board may adopt the proposed code of ordinances which becomes law upon publication of the ordinance adopting it. If the board substantially amends the proposed code of ordinances after a hearing, notice and hearing shall be repeated.\n\nb. Ordinances and amendments which become effective after adoption of a code of ordinances may be compiled as a supplement to the code, and upon adoption of the supplement by resolution, become part of the code of ordinances.\n\nc. An adopted code of ordinances is presumptive evidence of the passage, publication, and content of the ordinances therein as of the date of the auditor’s certification of the ordinance adopting the code or supplement.\n\n11. The compensation paid to a newspaper for a publication required by this section shall not exceed the fee provided in section 618.11. The compensation paid to a newspaper for publication of the complete text of an ordinance shall not exceed three-fourths of the fee provided in section 618.11.\n\n12. The board may adopt the provisions of a statewide or nationally recognized standard code or portions of any such code by an ordinance which identifies the code by subject matter, source, and date, and incorporates the provisions either by reference or by setting them forth in full. The code or portion shall be adopted only after notice and hearing in the manner provided in subsection 10.\n\n13. Immediately after the effective date of a measure establishing a zoning district, building lines, or fire limits, the auditor shall certify the measure and a plat showing the district, lines, or limits, to the recorder. The recorder shall record the measure and plat in the miscellaneous record or other book provided for special records, and shall index the record.\n\n14. A measure voted upon is not invalid because a supervisor has a conflict of interest, unless the vote of the supervisor was decisive to passage of the measure. If a majority or unanimous vote of the board is required by statute, the majority or vote shall be computed on the basis of the number of supervisors not disqualified by reason of conflict of interest. However, a majority of all supervisors is required for a quorum. For the purposes of this subsection, the statement of a supervisor that the supervisor declines to vote by reason of conflict of interest is conclusive and shall be entered of record.\n\n15. A valid measure adopted by a county prior to July 1, 1981, remains valid unless the measure is irreconcilable with a state law.\n\n16. A county shall not provide a civil penalty in excess of seven hundred fifty dollars for the violation of an ordinance which is classified as a county infraction or if the infraction is a repeat offense, a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each repeat offense. A county infraction is not punishable by imprisonment.\n\n1.

A county by ordinance may provide that a violation of an ordinance is a county infraction.\n\n3. A county shall not provide that a violation of an ordinance is a county infraction if the violation is a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious misdemeanor under state law or if the violation is a simple misdemeanor under chapters 687 through 747.\n\n4. An officer authorized by a county to enforce a county code or regulation may issue a civil citation to a person who commits a county infraction. The citation may be served by personal service as provided in\n\nrule of civil procedure 1.305\n\n, by certified mail addressed to the defendant at the defendant’s last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by publication in the manner as provided in\n\nrule of civil procedure 1.310\n\nand subject to the conditions of\n\nrule of civil procedure 1.311\n\n.

The time and place of court appearance.\n\ng. The penalty for failure to appear in court.\n\n5. In proceedings before the court for a county infraction:\n\na. The matter shall be tried before a magistrate or district associate judge in the same manner as a small claim.\n\nb. The county has the burden of proof that the county infraction occurred and that the defendant committed the infraction. The proof shall be by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence.\n\nc. The court shall ensure that the defendant has received a copy of the charges and that the defendant understands the charges. The defendant may question all witnesses who appear for the county and produce evidence or witnesses on the defendant’s behalf.\n\nd. The defendant may be represented by counsel of the defendant’s own selection and at the defendant’s own expense.\n\ne. The defendant may answer by admitting or denying the infraction.\n\nf. If a county infraction is proven, the court shall enter judgment against the defendant. If the infraction is not proven, the court shall dismiss it.\n\n6. Notwithstanding section 602.8106, subsection 3, penalties or forfeitures collected by the court for county infractions shall be remitted to the county in the same manner as fines and forfeitures are remitted to cities for criminal violations under section 602.8106. If the person named in the citation is served as provided in this section and fails without good cause to appear in response to the civil citation, judgment shall be entered against the person cited.\n\n7. A person against whom judgment is entered, shall pay court costs and fees as in small claims under chapter 631. If the action is dismissed, the county is liable for the court costs and court fees. Where the action is disposed of without payment, or provision for assessment, of court costs, the clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the county.\n\n8. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this section does not preclude a county from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same action.\n\n9. a. When judgment has been entered against a defendant, the court may do any of the following:\n\n(1) Impose a civil penalty by entry of a personal judgment against the defendant.\n\n(2) Direct that payment of the civil penalty be suspended or deferred under conditions imposed by the court.\n\n(3) Grant appropriate alternative relief ordering the defendant to abate or cease the violation.\n\n(4) Authorize the county to abate or correct the violation.\n\n(5) Order that the county’s costs for abatement or correction of the violation be entered as a personal judgment against the defendant or assessed against the property where the violation occurred, or both.\n\nb. If a defendant willfully violates the terms of an order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.\n\n10. The magistrate or district associate judge shall have jurisdiction to assess or enter judgment for costs of abatement or correction in an amount not to exceed the jurisdictional amount for a money judgment in a civil action pursuant to section 631.1, subsection 1, for magistrates and section 602.6306, subsection 2, for district associate judges. If the county seeks abatement or correction costs in excess of those amounts, the case shall be referred to the district court for hearing and entry of an appropriate order. The procedure for hearing in the district court shall be the same procedure as that for a small claims appeal pursuant to section 631.13.\n\n11. A defendant or the county may file a motion for a new trial or may appeal the decision of the magistrate or district associate judge to the district court. The procedure on appeal shall be the same as for a small claim pursuant to section 631.13. A factual determination made by the trial court, supported by substantial evidence as shown in the record, is binding for purposes of appeal relating to the violation at issue, but shall not be admissible or binding as to any future violation for the same or similar ordinance provision by the same defendant.\n\n12. This section does not preclude a peace officer of a county from issuing a criminal citation for a violation of a county code or regulation if criminal penalties are also provided for the violation. Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted by the defendant to exist, constitutes a separate offense.\n\n13. The issuance of a civil citation for a county infraction or the ensuing court proceedings do not provide an action for false arrest, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution.\n\n86 Acts, ch 1202, §4; 87 Acts, ch 99, §1 – 3; 89 Acts, ch 150, §1 – 4; 98 Acts, ch 1144, §2; 2003 Acts, ch 178, §22; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §133\n\nReferred to in §137.117, 331.302, 455B.146, 455B.175, 455B.192",

The amount estimated and certified to apply on principal and interest for any one year may only exceed the statutory rate of levy limit, if any, by the amount that the registered voters of the county have approved at a special election, which may be held at the same time as the general election and may be included in the proposition authorizing the issuance of bonds, if an election on the proposition is necessary, or may be submitted as a separate proposition at the same election or at a different election.

The appropriate medical examiner shall notify the city or state law enforcement agency or sheriff and take charge of the body.\n\n2. a. If a person’s death affects the public interest as specified in subsection 3, the county medical examiner shall conduct a preliminary investigation of the cause and manner of death, prepare a written report of the findings, promptly submit the full report to the state medical examiner on forms prescribed for that purpose, and submit a copy of the report to the county attorney.\n\nb. (1) Except as provided in section 218.64 or as otherwise provided by law, for each preliminary investigation and the preparation and submission of the required reports, the county medical examiner and medical examiner investigator shall receive from the county of appointment or the decedent’s county of residence a fee determined by the board of the county of appointment plus the examiner’s and investigator’s actual expenses.\n\n(2) The fee and expenses shall be submitted by the county medical examiner and the medical examiner investigator as a joint invoice to the county of appointment which may immediately pay the invoice. If the county of appointment pays the invoice, the county of appointment shall seek reimbursement from the decedent’s county of residence.\n\n(3) If the county of appointment elects not to pay an invoice under subparagraph (2), the county shall forward the joint invoice to the decedent’s county of residence for payment to the county medical examiner and the medical examiner investigator. If the county medical examiner and medical examiner investigator do not receive payment from the county of the decedent’s residence within sixty days of receiving the joint invoice, the county of appointment shall pay the invoice.\n\n(4) If the person’s death is caused by a defendant for whom a judgment of conviction and sentence is rendered under section 707.2, 707.3, 707.4, 707.5, or 707.6A, the county of the person’s residence or the county of appointment, as applicable, may recover from the defendant the fee and expenses.\n\nc.

Death of a person confined in a prison, jail, or correctional institution.\n\ng. Death of a person who was prediagnosed as a terminal or bedfast case who did not have a physician in attendance within the preceding thirty days; or death of a person who was admitted to and had received services from a hospice program as defined in section 135J.1, if a physician or registered nurse employed by the program was not in attendance within thirty days preceding death.\n\nh. Death of a person if the body is not claimed by a person authorized to control the deceased person’s remains under section 144C.5, or a friend.\n\ni. Death of a person if the identity of the deceased is unknown.\n\nj. Death of a child under the age of two years if death results from an unknown cause or if the circumstances surrounding the death indicate that sudden infant death syndrome may be the cause of death.\n\nk. Death of a person committed or admitted to a state mental health institute, a state resource center, or the state training school.\n\n4. a. The county medical examiner shall conduct the investigation in the manner required by the state medical examiner and shall determine whether the public interest requires an autopsy or other special investigation. However, if the death occurred in the manner specified in subsection 3, paragraph “j”, the county medical examiner shall order an autopsy, claims for the payment of which shall be filed with the state appeal board and, if authorized by the board, shall be paid out of moneys in the general fund of the state not otherwise appropriated. In determining the need for an autopsy, the county medical examiner may consider the request for an autopsy from a public official or private person, but the state medical examiner or the county attorney of the county where the death occurred may require an autopsy except as provided in paragraph “b”.\n\nb. If after the county medical examiner’s or state medical examiner’s investigation of a deceased child the medical examiner determines that the deceased child’s cause and manner of death are obvious and there are no significant legal, medical, or investigative concerns by the medical examiner, social services, or law enforcement, an autopsy shall not be required under paragraph “a”.\n\nc. The county medical examiner may refer a body for autopsy or further investigation pursuant to paragraph “a” to any facility accredited by the national association of medical examiners. The county shall pay to the receiving facility a fee equal to an autopsy fee established by the office of the state medical examiner by rule.\n\n5. a. A person making an autopsy shall promptly file a complete record of the findings in the office of the state medical examiner and the county attorney of the county where death occurred and the county attorney of the county where any injury contributing to or causing the death was sustained.\n\nb. A summary of the findings resulting from an autopsy of a child under the age of two years whose death occurred in the manner specified in subsection 3, paragraph “j”, shall be transmitted immediately by the physician who performed the autopsy to the county medical examiner. The report shall be forwarded to the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child by the county medical examiner or a designee of the county medical examiner, or through the infant’s attending physician. A copy of the autopsy report filed with the county attorney shall be available to the parents, guardian, or custodian upon request.\n\n6. The report of an investigation made by the state medical examiner or a county medical examiner and the record and report of an autopsy made under this section or chapter 691, shall be received as evidence in any court or other proceedings, except that statements by witnesses or other persons and conclusions on extraneous matters included in the report are not admissible. The person preparing a report or record given in evidence may be subpoenaed as a witness in any civil or criminal case by any party to the cause. A copy of a record, photograph, laboratory finding, or record in the office of the state medical examiner or any medical examiner, when attested to by the state medical examiner or a staff member or the medical examiner in whose office the record, photograph, or finding is filed, shall be received as evidence in any court or other proceedings for any purpose for which the original could be received without proof of the official character of the person whose name is signed to it.\n\n7. In case of a sudden, violent, or suspicious death after which the body is buried without an investigation or autopsy, the county medical examiner, upon being advised of the facts, shall notify the county attorney. The county attorney shall apply for a court order requiring the body to be exhumed in accordance with chapter 144. Upon receipt of the court order, an autopsy shall be performed by a medical examiner or by a pathologist designated by the medical examiner and the facts disclosed by the autopsy shall be communicated to the court ordering the disinterment for appropriate action.\n\n8. Where donation of the remains of the deceased to a medical school or similar institution equipped with facilities to perform autopsies is provided by will or directed by the person authorized to control the deceased person’s remains under section 144C.5, any autopsy under this section shall be performed at the direction of the school or institution, and in such a manner as to further the purpose of the donation, while serving the public interest.\n\n9. If an autopsy is ordered under this section, the county shall reimburse the funeral director for all costs associated with the transportation of the body to and from the facility performing the autopsy at a rate equivalent to the rate of reimbursement allowed under the standard mileage rate method for computation of business expenses pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code at the time the transportation occurs plus any other associated fees.\n\n1, 2.
