It is hereby found and declared that there exist in municipalities of the state slum and blighted areas, as defined in this chapter, which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blighted areas is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency and consume an excessive proportion of state revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization, and other forms of public protection, services, and facilities.\n\n2. It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this chapter, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this chapter, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that fringe areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and through the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.\n\n3. It is further found and declared that there exists in this state the continuing need for programs to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment and a shortage of housing; and that it is accordingly necessary to assist and retain local industries and commercial enterprises to strengthen and revitalize the economy of this state and its municipalities; that accordingly it is necessary to provide means and methods for the encouragement and assistance of industrial and commercial enterprises in locating, purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, modernizing, improving, maintaining, repairing, furnishing, equipping, and expanding in this state and its municipalities, for the provision of public improvements related to housing and residential development, and for the construction of housing for low and moderate income families; that accordingly it is necessary to authorize local governing bodies to designate areas of a municipality as economic development areas for commercial and industrial enterprises, public improvements related to housing and residential development, or construction of housing for low and moderate income families; and that it is also necessary to encourage the location and expansion of commercial enterprises to more conveniently provide needed services and facilities of the commercial enterprises to municipalities and the residents of the municipalities. Therefore, the powers granted in this chapter constitute the performance of essential public purposes for this state and its municipalities.\n\n4. It is further found and declared that the powers conferred by this chapter are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and for which the power of eminent domain, to the extent authorized, and police power exercised; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions herein enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n[C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §403.2]\n\n85 Acts, ch 66, §1; 91 Acts, ch 186, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §13\n\n; 2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §34, 49\n\n; 2020 Acts, ch 1063, §209",

A municipality shall not approve an urban renewal project for an urban renewal area unless the governing body has, by resolution, determined the area to be a slum area, blighted area, economic development area or a combination of those areas, and designated the area as appropriate for an urban renewal project. The local governing body shall not approve an urban renewal plan until a general plan for the municipality has been prepared. For this purpose and other municipal purposes, authority is vested in every municipality to prepare, to adopt and to revise from time to time, a general plan for the physical development of the municipality as a whole, giving due regard to the environs and metropolitan surroundings. A municipality shall not acquire real property for an urban renewal project unless the local governing body has approved the urban renewal project in accordance with subsection 4.\n\n2. a. The municipality may itself prepare or cause to be prepared an urban renewal plan; or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to a municipality. Prior to its approval of an urban renewal plan, the local governing body shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the municipality, if any, for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the municipality as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to the local governing body within thirty days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission or, if no recommendations are received within the thirty days, then, without such recommendations, the local governing body may proceed with the hearing on the proposed urban renewal plan prescribed by subsection 3.\n\nb. (1) Prior to its approval of an urban renewal plan which provides for a division of revenue pursuant to section 403.19, the municipality shall mail the proposed plan by regular mail to the affected taxing entities. The municipality shall include with the proposed plan notification of a consultation to be held between the municipality and affected taxing entities prior to the public hearing on the urban renewal plan. If the proposed urban renewal plan or proposed urban renewal project within the urban renewal area includes the use of taxes resulting from a division of revenue under section 403.19 for a public building, including but not limited to a police station, fire station, administration building, swimming pool, hospital, library, recreational building, city hall, or other public building that is exempt from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection, equipment, remodeling, or reconstruction of, and additions or extensions to, such a building, the municipality shall include with the proposed plan notification an analysis of alternative development options and funding for the urban renewal area or urban renewal project and the reasons such options would be less feasible than the proposed urban renewal plan or proposed urban renewal project. A copy of the analysis required in this subparagraph shall be included with the urban renewal report required under section 331.403 or 384.22, as applicable, and filed by December 1 following adoption of the urban renewal plan or project.\n\n(2) Each affected taxing entity may appoint a representative to attend the consultation. The consultation may include a discussion of the estimated growth in valuation of taxable property included in the proposed urban renewal area, the fiscal impact of the division of revenue on the affected taxing entities, the estimated impact on the provision of services by each of the affected taxing entities in the proposed urban renewal area, and the duration of any bond issuance included in the plan. The designated representative of the affected taxing entity may make written recommendations for modification to the proposed division of revenue no later than seven days following the date of the consultation. The representative of the municipality shall, no later than seven days prior to the public hearing on the urban renewal plan, submit a written response to the affected taxing entity addressing the recommendations for modification to the proposed division of revenue.\n\n3. The local governing body shall hold a public hearing on an urban renewal plan after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the municipality. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing, shall generally identify the urban renewal area covered by the plan, and shall outline the general scope of the urban renewal activities under consideration. A copy of the notice shall be sent by ordinary mail to each affected taxing entity.\n\n4. Following such hearing, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal plan if it finds that:\n\na. A feasible method exists for the location of families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area into decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families.\n\nb. (1) The urban renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality as a whole; provided, that if the urban renewal area consists of an area of open land to be acquired by the municipality, such area shall not be so acquired except:\n\n(a) If it is to be developed for residential uses, the local governing body shall determine that a shortage of housing of sound standards and design with decency, safety, and sanitation exists in the municipality; that the acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality; and that one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\n(i) That the need for housing accommodations has been or will be increased as a result of the clearance of slums in other areas, including other portions of the urban renewal area.\n\n(ii) That conditions of blight in the municipality and the shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing cause or contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime, so as to constitute a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare.\n\n(iii) That the provision of public improvements related to housing and residential development will encourage housing and residential development which is necessary to encourage the retention or relocation of industrial and commercial enterprises in this state and its municipalities.\n\n(iv) The acquisition of the area is necessary to provide for the construction of housing for low and moderate income families.\n\n(b) If it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that such nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives.\n\n(2) The acquisition of open land authorized in subparagraph (1), subparagraph divisions (a) and (b) may require the exercise of governmental action, as provided in this chapter, because of defective or unusual conditions of title, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, improper subdivisions, outmoded street patterns, deterioration of site, economic disuse, unsuitable topography or faulty lot layouts, or because of the need for the correlation of the area with other areas of a municipality by streets and modern traffic requirements, or any combination of such factors or other conditions which retard development of the area. If such governmental action involves the exercise of eminent domain authority, the municipality is subject to the limitations of this chapter and chapters 6A and 6B.\n\n5. a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an urban renewal plan may be modified at any time. However, if the urban renewal plan is modified after the lease or sale by the municipality of real property in the urban renewal project area, such modification may be conditioned upon such approval of the owner, lessee, or successor in interest as the municipality may deem advisable, and in any event such modification shall be subject to such rights at law or in equity as a lessee or purchaser, or a lessee’s or purchaser’s successor or successors in interest, may be entitled to assert.\n\nb. A municipality shall not approve an urban renewal project for an urban renewal area unless the governing body has amended or modified the adopted urban renewal plan to include the urban renewal project.\n\nc. The municipality shall comply with the notification, consultation, and hearing process provided in this section prior to the approval of any amendment or modification to an adopted urban renewal plan if such amendment or modification provides for refunding bonds or refinancing resulting in an increase in debt service or provides for the issuance of bonds or other indebtedness, to be funded primarily in the manner provided in section 403.19, or if such amendment or modification provides for the inclusion and approval of an urban renewal project under paragraph “b”. However, the review and recommendation process conducted by the municipality’s planning commission under subsection 2, paragraph “a”, shall not be required when amending or modifying an adopted urban renewal plan.\n\nd. Once determined to be a blighted area, a slum area, or an economic development area by a municipality, an urban renewal area shall not be redetermined by the municipality throughout the duration of the urban renewal area.\n\n6. Upon the approval by a municipality of an urban renewal plan or of any modification thereof, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area, and the municipality may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, where the local governing body certifies that an area is in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, or other catastrophe respecting which the governor of the state has certified the need for disaster assistance under Pub. L. No. 81-875, Eighty-first Congress, 64 Stat. 1109, codified at 42 U.S.C. §1855 – 1855g or other federal law, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal plan and an urban renewal project with respect to such area without regard to the provisions of subsection 4 and without regard to provisions of this section requiring notification and consultation, a general plan for the municipality, and a public hearing on the urban renewal plan or project.\n\n[C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §403.5]\n\n85 Acts, ch 66, §3; 94 Acts, ch 1182, §6; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §14 – 16; 99 Acts, ch 171, §35, 41, 42; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §97\n\n; 2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §35, 36, 49\n\n; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §157, 180; 2012 Acts, ch 1124, §13, 14\n\nReferred to in §403.14, 403.17",

The assessment agreement shall be presented to the appropriate assessor. The assessor shall review the plans and specifications for the improvements to be made and if the minimum actual value contained in the assessment agreement appears to be reasonable, the assessor shall execute the following certification upon the agreement:\n\nThe undersigned assessor, being legally responsible for the assessment of the above described property upon completion of the improvements to be made on it, certifies that the actual value assigned to that land and improvements upon completion shall not be less than $....................................\n\nb. This assessment agreement with the certification of the assessor and a copy of this subsection shall be filed in the office of the county recorder of the county where the property is located. Upon completion of the improvements, the assessor shall value the property as required by law, except that the actual value shall not be less than the minimum actual value contained in the assessment agreement. This subsection does not prohibit the assessor from assigning a higher actual value to the property or prohibit the owner from seeking administrative or legal remedies to reduce the actual value assigned except that the actual value shall not be reduced below the minimum actual value contained in the assessment agreement. An assessor, county auditor, board of review, director of revenue, or court of this state shall not reduce or order the reduction of the actual value below the minimum actual value in the agreement during the term of the agreement regardless of the actual value which may result from the incomplete construction of improvements, destruction or diminution by any cause, insured or uninsured, except in the case of acquisition or reacquisition of the property by a public entity. Recording of an assessment agreement complying with this subsection constitutes notice of the assessment agreement to a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer of the land or any part of it, whether voluntary or involuntary, and is binding upon a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer.\n\n[C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §403.6]\n\n83 Acts, ch 48, §2, 3; 84 Acts, ch 1210, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1209, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §17; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §160; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286\n\n; 2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §37, 49\n\n; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2010 Acts, ch 1069, §132 – 134; 2015 Acts, ch 29, §48\n\nReferred to in §403.8, 403.14, 427B.19D",

The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns shall devote the real property only to the uses specified in the urban renewal plan, and they may be obligated to comply with other requirements the municipality determines to be in the public interest, including the requirement to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on the real property required by the urban renewal plan. The real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan except as provided in subsection 3. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, a municipality shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in the plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality retaining the property; and the objectives of the plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. The municipality in an instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that the purchaser or lessee shall not sell, lease or otherwise transfer the real property, without the prior written consent of the municipality, until the purchaser or lessee has completed the construction of any or all improvements which the purchaser or lessee has become obligated to construct. Real property acquired by a municipality which, in accordance with the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred, shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest, consistent with the carrying out of the urban renewal plan. A contract for a transfer under the urban renewal plan, or a part or parts of the contract or plan as the municipality determines, may be recorded in the land records of the county in a manner to afford actual or constructive notice of the contract or plan.\n\n2. a. A municipality may dispose of real property in an urban renewal area to private persons only under reasonable competitive bidding procedures it shall prescribe, or as provided in this subsection. A municipality, by public notice by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community, thirty days prior to the execution of a contract to sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property, and prior to the delivery of an instrument of conveyance with respect to the real property under this section, may invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate an urban renewal area, or a part of the area. The notice shall identify the area, or portion of the area, and shall state that proposals shall be made by those interested within thirty days after the date of publication of the notice, and that further information available may be obtained at the office designated in the notice. The municipality shall consider all redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals, and the financial and legal ability of the persons making the proposals to carry them out, and the municipality may negotiate with any persons for proposals concerning the purchase, lease or other transfer of real property acquired by the municipality in the urban renewal area. The municipality may accept the proposal it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. However, a notification of intention to accept the proposal shall be filed with the governing body not less than thirty days prior to the acceptance. Thereafter, the municipality may execute a contract in accordance with subsection 1 and may deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and may take all steps necessary to effectuate the contract.\n\nb. However, this subsection does not apply to real property disposed of for the purpose of development or redevelopment as an industrial building or facility, facilities for use as a center for export for international trade, a home office or regional office facility for a multistate business or which meets the criteria set forth in subsection 3.\n\n3. The requirement that real property or an interest in real property transferred or retained for the purpose of a development or redevelopment be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair market value does not apply if the developer enters into a written assessment agreement with the municipality pursuant to section 403.6, subsections 18 and 19, and the minimum actual value contained in the assessment agreement would indicate that there will be sufficient taxable valuations to permit the collection of incremental taxes as provided in section 403.19, subsection 2, to cause the indebtedness and other costs incurred by the municipality with respect to the property or interest transferred or retained to be repayable as to principal within four tax years following the commencement of full operation of the development.\n\n4. A municipality may temporarily operate and maintain real property acquired in an urban renewal area pending the disposition of the property as authorized in this chapter, without regard to the provisions of subsection 1 above, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable, even though not in conformity with the urban renewal plan.\n\n[C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §403.8]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1210, §2, 3; 88 Acts, ch 1144, §1, 3; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2014 Acts, ch 1026, §82\n\nReferred to in §403.6",

At the meeting, the local governing body shall receive oral or written objections from any resident or property owner of the municipality. After all objections have been received and considered, the local governing body, at that meeting or any subsequent meeting, may take additional action for the issuance of the bonds or abandon the proposal to issue the bonds. Any resident or property owner of the municipality may appeal the decision of the local governing body to take additional action to the district court of the county in which any part of the municipality is located, within fifteen days after the additional action is taken. The additional action of the local governing body is final and conclusive unless the court finds that the municipality exceeded its authority.\n\n4. Such bonds may be sold at not less than ninety-eight percent of par at public or private sale, or may be exchanged for other bonds at not less than ninety-eight percent of par.\n\n5. In case any of the public officials of the municipality whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this chapter shall cease to be such officials before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officials had remained in office until such delivery.

      "text": "403.19 Division of revenue from taxation — tax increment financing.\n\nA municipality may provide by ordinance that taxes levied on taxable property in an urban renewal area each year by or for the benefit of the state, city, county, school district, or other taxing district, shall be divided as follows:\n\n1. a. Unless otherwise provided in this section, that portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate at which the tax is levied each year by or for each of the taxing districts upon the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the urban renewal area, as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the first calendar year in which the municipality certifies to the county auditor the amount of loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds payable from the division of property tax revenue, or on the assessment roll last equalized prior to the date of initial adoption of the urban renewal plan if the plan was adopted prior to July 1, 1972, shall be allocated to and when collected be paid into the fund for the respective taxing district as taxes by or for the taxing district into which all other property taxes are paid. However, the municipality may choose to divide that portion of the taxes which would be produced by levying the municipality’s portion of the total tax rate levied by or for the municipality upon the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the urban renewal area, as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the effective date of the ordinance and if the municipality so chooses, an affected taxing entity may allow a municipality to divide that portion of the taxes which would be produced by levying the affected taxing district’s portion of the total tax rate levied by or for the affected taxing entity upon the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the urban renewal area, as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the effective date of the ordinance. This choice to divide a portion of the taxes shall not be construed to change the effective date of the division of property tax revenue with respect to an urban renewal plan in existence on July 1, 1994.\n\nb. For the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing district which did not include the territory in an urban renewal area on the effective date of the ordinance or initial adoption of the plan, but to which the territory has been annexed or otherwise included after the effective date, the assessment roll applicable to property in the annexed territory as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the effective date of the ordinance, which amends the plan to include the annexed area, shall be used in determining the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the annexed area.\n\nc. For the purposes of dividing taxes under section 260E.4, the applicable assessment roll for purposes of paragraph “a” shall be the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the first written agreement providing that all or a portion of program costs are to be paid for by incremental property taxes. The community college shall file a copy of the agreement with the appropriate assessor. The assessor may, within fourteen days of such filing, physically inspect the applicable taxable business property. If upon such inspection the assessor determines that there has been a change in the value of the property from the value as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the filing of the agreement and such change in value is due to new construction, additions or improvements to existing structures, or remodeling of existing structures for which a building permit was required, the assessor shall promptly determine the value of the property as of the inspection in the manner provided in chapter 441 and that value shall be included for purposes of the jobs training project in the assessed value of the employer’s taxable business property as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year preceding the filing of the agreement. The assessor, within thirty days of such filing, shall notify the community college and the employer or business of that valuation which shall be included in the assessed valuation for purposes of this subsection and section 260E.4. The value determined by the assessor shall reflect the change in value due solely to new construction, additions or improvements to existing structures, or remodeling of existing structures for which a building permit was required.\n\n2. a. That portion of the taxes each year in excess of such amount shall be allocated to and when collected be paid into a special fund of the municipality to pay the principal of and interest on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise, including bonds issued under the authority of section 403.9, subsection 1, incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, an urban renewal project within the area, and to provide assistance for low and moderate income family housing as provided in section 403.22. However, except as provided in paragraph “b”, taxes for the regular and voter-approved physical plant and equipment levy of a school district imposed pursuant to section 298.2 and taxes for the instructional support program of a school district imposed pursuant to section 257.19, taxes for the payment of bonds and interest of each taxing district, and taxes imposed under section 346.27, subsection 22, related to joint county-city buildings shall be collected against all taxable property within the taxing district without limitation by the provisions of this subsection.\n\nb. (1) All or a portion of the taxes for the physical plant and equipment levy shall be paid by the school district to the municipality if the auditor certifies to the school district by July 1 the amount of such levy that is necessary to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued by the municipality to finance an urban renewal project, which bonds were issued before July 1, 2001. Indebtedness incurred to refund bonds issued prior to July 1, 2001, shall not be included in the certification. Such school district shall pay over the amount certified by November 1 and May 1 of the fiscal year following certification to the school district.\n\n(2) (a) All or a portion of the taxes for the instructional support program levy of a school district shall be paid by the school district to the municipality if the auditor, pursuant to subsection 11, certifies to the school district by July 1 the amount of such levy that is necessary to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued or other indebtedness incurred by the municipality to finance an urban renewal project if such bonds or indebtedness were issued or incurred on or before April 24, 2012. Such school district shall pay over the amount certified by November 1 and May 1 of the fiscal year following certification to the school district.\n\n(b) In lieu of payment to a municipality under subparagraph division (a), a school district may by resolution of the board of directors of the school district approve at a regular meeting of the board of directors the payment of all or a portion of the instructional support program property tax revenue excluded under paragraph “a”, to the municipality for the payment of principal and interest on such bonds issued or such other indebtedness incurred by the municipality before, on, or after April 24, 2012.\n\nc. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in an urban renewal area exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in such area as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in subsection 1, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the urban renewal area shall be paid into the funds for the respective taxing districts as taxes by or for the taxing districts in the same manner as all other property taxes. When such loans, advances, indebtedness, and bonds, if any, and interest thereon, have been paid, all moneys thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in such urban renewal area shall be paid into the funds for the respective taxing districts in the same manner as taxes on all other property.\n\nd. In those instances where a school district has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 279.64 for sharing of school district taxes levied and collected from valuation described in this subsection and released to the school district, the school district shall transfer the taxes as provided in the agreement.\n\n3. The portion of taxes mentioned in subsection 2 and the special fund into which they shall be paid, may be irrevocably pledged by a municipality for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances, bonds issued under the authority of section 403.9, subsection 1, or indebtedness incurred by a municipality to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, the urban renewal project within the area.\n\n4. As used in this section the word “taxes” includes, but is not limited to, all levies on an ad valorem basis upon land or real property.\n\n5. An ordinance adopted under this section providing for a division of revenue shall be filed in the office of the county auditor of each county where the property that is subject to the ordinance is located.\n\n6. a. (1) A municipality shall certify to the county auditor on or before December 1 the amount of loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds, including interest negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds, which qualify for payment from the special fund referred to in subsection 2, for each urban renewal area in the municipality, and the filing of the certificate shall make it a duty of the auditor to provide for the division of taxes in each subsequent year without further certification, except as provided in paragraphs “b” and “c”, until the amount of the loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds is paid to the special fund. Such certification shall include all amounts which qualify for payment from the special fund referred to in subsection 2 during the next fiscal year and all amounts which qualify for payment from the special fund in any subsequent fiscal year. If any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds are issued which qualify for payment from the special fund and which are in addition to amounts already certified, the municipality shall certify the amount of the additional obligations on or before December 1 of the year such obligations were issued, and the filing of the certificate shall make it a duty of the auditor to provide for the division of taxes in each subsequent year without further certification, except as provided in paragraphs “b” and “c”, until the amount of the loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds is paid to the special fund. Any subsequent certifications under this subsection shall not include amounts previously certified.\n\n(2) A certification made under this paragraph “a” shall include the date that the individual loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds were initially approved by the governing body of the municipality.\n\nb. If the amount certified in paragraph “a” is reduced by payment from sources other than the division of taxes, by a refunding or refinancing of the obligation which results in lowered principal and interest on the amount of the obligation, or for any other reason, the municipality on or before December 1 of the year the action was taken which resulted in the reduction shall certify the amount of the reduction to the county auditor.\n\nc. In any year, the county auditor shall, upon receipt of a certified request from a municipality filed on or before December 1, increase the amount to be allocated under subsection 1 in order to reduce the amount to be allocated in the following fiscal year to the special fund, to the extent that the municipality does not request allocation to the special fund of the full portion of taxes which could be collected. Upon receipt of a certificate from a municipality, the auditor shall mail a copy of the certificate to each affected taxing district.\n\nd. For purposes of this section, “indebtedness” includes but is not limited to written agreements whereby the municipality agrees to exempt, rebate, refund, or reimburse property taxes, provide a grant for property taxes paid, or make a direct payment of taxes, with moneys in the special fund referred to in subsection 2, and bonds, notes, or other obligations that are secured by or subject to payment from moneys appropriated by the municipality from moneys in the special fund referred to in subsection 2.\n\n7. Tax collections within each taxing district may be allocated to the entire taxing district including the taxes on the valuations determined under subsection 1 and to the special fund created under subsection 2 in the proportion of their taxable valuations determined as provided in this section.\n\n8. For any fiscal year, a municipality may certify to the county auditor for physical plant and equipment revenue necessary for payment of principal and interest on bonds issued prior to July 1, 2001, only if the municipality certified for such revenue for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000. A municipality shall not certify to the county auditor for a school district more than the amount the municipality certified for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000. If for any fiscal year a municipality fails to certify to the county auditor for a school district by July 1 the amount of physical plant and equipment revenue necessary for payment of principal and interest on such bonds, as provided in subsection 2, the school district is not required to pay over the revenue to the municipality. If a school district and a municipality are unable to agree on the amount of physical plant and equipment revenue certified by the municipality for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001, either party may request that the state appeal board review and finally pass upon the amount that may be certified. Such appeals must be presented in writing to the state appeal board no later than July 31 following certification. The burden shall be on the municipality to prove that the physical plant and equipment levy revenue is necessary to pay principal and interest on bonds issued prior to July 1, 2001. A final decision must be issued by the state appeal board no later than the following October 1.\n\n9. a. Moneys from any source deposited into the special fund created in this section shall not be expended for or otherwise used in connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not presently located within the municipality, unless one of the following occurs:\n\n(1) The local governing body of the municipality where the commercial or industrial enterprise is currently located and the local governing body of the municipality where the commercial or industrial enterprise is proposing to relocate have either entered into a written agreement concerning the relocation of the commercial or industrial enterprise or have entered into a written agreement concerning the general use of economic incentives to attract commercial or industrial development within those municipalities.\n\n(2) The local governing body of the municipality where the commercial or industrial enterprise is proposing to relocate finds that the use of deposits into the special fund for an urban renewal project that includes such a relocation is in the public interest. A local governing body’s finding that an urban renewal project that includes a commercial or industrial enterprise relocation is in the public interest shall include written verification from the commercial or industrial enterprise that the enterprise is actively considering moving all or a part of its operations to a location outside the state and a specific finding that such an out-of-state move would result in a significant reduction in either the enterprise’s total employment in the state or in the total amount of wages earned by employees of the enterprise in the state.\n\nb. For the purposes of this subsection, “relocation” means the closure or substantial reduction of an enterprise’s existing operations in one area of the state and the initiation of substantially the same operation in the same county or a contiguous county in the state. This subsection does not prohibit an enterprise from expanding its operations in another area of the state provided that existing operations of a similar nature are not closed or substantially reduced.\n\n10. a. Interest or earnings received on amounts deposited into the special fund created in this section and the net proceeds from the sale of assets purchased using amounts deposited into the special fund created in this section shall be credited to the special fund and shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this section.\n\nb. Moneys in the special fund created in this section shall not be transferred to another fund of the municipality except for the payment of loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from the special fund.\n\n11. For any fiscal year, a municipality may certify to the county auditor for instructional support program property tax revenue necessary for payment of principal and interest on bonds issued or other indebtedness incurred for an urban renewal project on or before April 24, 2012. If for any fiscal year a municipality fails to certify to the county auditor by July 1 the amount of instructional support program property tax revenue necessary for payment of principal and interest on such bonds, as provided in subsection 2, the school district is not required to pay over the revenue to the municipality. If a school district and a municipality are unable to agree on the amount of instructional support program property tax revenue certified by the municipality, either party may request that the state appeal board review and finally pass upon the amount that may be certified. Such appeals must be presented in writing to the state appeal board no later than July 31 following certification. The burden shall be on the municipality to prove that the instructional support program property tax revenue is necessary to pay principal and interest on the applicable bonds. A final decision must be issued by the state appeal board no later than the following October 1.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §403.19]\n\n85 Acts, ch 240, §3 – 5; 88 Acts, ch 1144, §2, 3; 91 Acts, ch 214, §4; 94 Acts, ch 1182, §10 – 12; 96 Acts, ch 1047, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1180, §16; 96 Acts, ch 1204, §22, 23; 2000 Acts, ch 1054, §2, 3; 2001 Acts, ch 176, §40, 41, 47; 2006 Acts, ch 1131, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1156, §2; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2011 Acts, ch 50, §1; 2012 Acts, ch 1060, §6, 7; 2012 Acts, ch 1124, §16 – 21, 26\n\nReferred to in §2.48, 24.21, 260E.2, 260E.4, 279.64, 298.3, 331.403, 331.441, 357H.9, 384.22, 403.5, 403.6, 403.8, 403.9, 403.17, 403.20, 403.22, 403.23, 423B.7, 423B.10, 427B.17, 427B.19, 427B.19A, 427B.19C, 437A.15, 437B.11, 441.21A, 455H.309",

For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Business” means an enterprise that is located in this state and that is operated for profit and under a single management. “Business” includes professional services and industrial enterprises, including but not limited to medical treatment facilities, manufacturing facilities, corporate headquarters, and research facilities. “Business” does not include a retail operation, a government entity, or a business which closes or substantially reduces its operation in one area of this state and relocates substantially the same operation to another area of this state.\n\nb. “Employee” means the individual employed in a targeted job that is subject to a withholding agreement.\n\nc. “Employer” means a business creating or retaining targeted jobs in a pilot project city pursuant to a withholding agreement.\n\nd. “Pilot project city” means a city that has applied and been approved as a pilot project city pursuant to subsection 2.\n\ne. “Qualifying investment” means a capital investment in real property including the purchase price of land and existing buildings, site preparation, building construction, and long-term lease costs. “Qualifying investment” also means a capital investment in depreciable assets. For purposes of this paragraph, “long-term lease costs” means those costs incurred or expected to be incurred under a lease during the duration of a withholding agreement.\n\nf. “Retained job” means a full-time equivalent position in existence at the time an employer applies to the authority for approval of a withholding agreement and which remains continuously filled and which is at risk of elimination if the project for which the employer is seeking assistance under the withholding agreement does not proceed.\n\ng. “Targeted job” means a job in a business which is or will be located in a pilot project city that pays a wage at least equal to the countywide average wage. “Targeted job” includes new or retained jobs from Iowa business expansions or retentions within the city limits of the pilot project city and those jobs resulting from established out-of-state businesses, as defined by the economic development authority, moving to or expanding in Iowa.\n\nh. “Withholding agreement” means the agreement between a pilot project city, the economic development authority, and an employer concerning the targeted jobs withholding credit authorized in subsection 3.\n\n2. a. An eligible city may apply for designation as a pilot project city pursuant to this subsection. An eligible city is a city that contains three or more census tracts and is located in a county meeting one of the following requirements:\n\n(1) A county that borders Nebraska.\n\n(2) A county that borders South Dakota.\n\n(3) A county that borders a state other than Nebraska or South Dakota.\n\nb. (1) The economic development authority shall approve four eligible cities as pilot project cities, one pursuant to paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), one pursuant to paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2), and two pursuant to paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3). If two eligible cities are approved which are located in the same county and the county has a population of less than forty-five thousand, the two approved eligible cities shall be considered one pilot project city. If more than two cities meeting the requirements of paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), apply to be designated as a pilot project city, the economic development authority shall determine which two cities hold the most potential to create new jobs or generate the greatest capital within their areas. Applications from eligible cities filed on or after October 1, 2006, shall not be considered.\n\n(2) If a pilot project city does not enter into a withholding agreement within one year of its approval as a pilot project city, the city shall lose its status as a pilot project city. If two pilot project cities are located in the same county, the loss of status by one pilot project city shall not cause the second pilot project city in the county to lose its status as a pilot project city. Upon such occurrence, the economic development authority shall take applications from other eligible cities to replace that city. Another city shall be designated within six months.\n\n3. a. A pilot project city may provide by resolution for the deposit into a designated withholding project fund of the targeted jobs withholding credit described in this section. The targeted jobs withholding credit shall be based upon the wages paid to employees pursuant to a withholding agreement.\n\nb. An amount equal to three percent of the gross wages paid by an employer to each employee under a withholding agreement shall be credited from the payment made by the employer pursuant to section 422.16. If the amount of the withholding by the employer is less than three percent of the gross wages paid to the employees covered by the withholding agreement, the employer shall receive a credit against other withholding taxes due by the employer or may carry the credit forward for up to ten years or until depleted, whichever is the earlier. The employer shall remit the amount of the credit quarterly, in the same manner as withholding payments are reported to the department of revenue, to the pilot project city to be allocated to and when collected paid into a designated withholding project fund for the project. All amounts so deposited shall be used or pledged by the pilot project city for a project related to the employer pursuant to the withholding agreement.\n\nc. (1) The pilot project city and the economic development authority shall enter into a withholding agreement with each employer concerning the targeted jobs withholding credit. The withholding agreement shall provide for the total amount of withholding credits awarded, as negotiated by the economic development authority, the pilot project city, and the employer. An agreement shall not provide for an amount of withholding credits that exceeds the amount of the qualifying investment made in the project. An agreement shall not be entered into with a business currently located in this state unless the business either creates or retains ten jobs or makes a qualifying investment of at least five hundred thousand dollars within the pilot project city. The withholding agreement may have a term of years negotiated by the economic development authority, the pilot project city, and the employer, of up to ten years. A withholding agreement specifying a term of years or a total amount of withholding credits shall terminate upon the expiration of the term of years specified in the agreement or upon the award of the total amount of withholding credits specified in the agreement, whichever occurs first. An employer shall not be obligated to enter into a withholding agreement. An agreement shall not be entered into with an employer not already located in a pilot project city when another Iowa community is competing for the same project and both the pilot project city and the other Iowa community are seeking assistance from the authority.\n\n(2) The pilot project city and the economic development authority shall not enter into a withholding agreement after June 30, 2024.\n\n(3) The employer, in conjunction with the pilot project city, shall provide on an annual basis to the economic development authority information documenting the total amount of payments and receipts under a withholding agreement, including all agreements with an employer to suspend, abate, exempt, rebate, refund, or reimburse property taxes, to provide a grant for property taxes paid or a grant not related to property taxes, or to make a direct payment of taxes, with moneys in the withholding project fund. The economic development authority shall verify the information provided and determine whether the pilot project city and the employer are in compliance with this section and the rules adopted by the economic development authority to implement this section.\n\n(4) The economic development authority board, on behalf of the authority, shall have the authority to approve or deny a withholding agreement according to the provisions of this section. Each withholding agreement, and the total amount of withholding credits allowed under the withholding agreement, shall be approved by the economic development authority board after taking into account the incentives or assistance received by or to be received by the employer under other economic development programs. The economic development authority board shall only deny an agreement if the agreement fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph “c” or the local match requirements in paragraph “k”, or if an employer is not in good standing as to prior or existing agreements with the economic development authority. The authority shall have the authority to negotiate a withholding agreement and may suggest changes to any of the terms of the agreement.\n\nd. A withholding agreement shall be disclosed to the public and shall contain but is not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) A copy of the adopted local development agreement between the pilot project city and the employer that outlines local incentives or assistance for the project using urban renewal or urban revitalization incentives, if applicable.\n\n(2) A list of any other amounts of incentives or assistance the employer may be receiving from other economic development programs, including grants, loans, forgivable loans, and tax credits.\n\n(3) The approval of local participating authorities.\n\n(4) The amount of local incentives or assistance received for each project of the employer.\n\ne. (1) The employer shall certify to the department of revenue that the targeted jobs withholding credit is in accordance with the withholding agreement and shall provide other information the department may require. Notice of any withholding agreement shall be provided promptly to the department of revenue following execution of the agreement by the pilot project city and the employer.\n\n(2) Following termination of the withholding agreement, the employer credits shall cease and any money received by the pilot project city after termination shall be remitted to the treasurer of state to be deposited into the general fund of the state. Notice shall be provided promptly to the department of revenue following termination.\n\nf. Pursuant to rules adopted by the economic development authority, the pilot project city shall provide on an annual basis to the economic development authority information documenting the compliance of each employer with each requirement of the withholding agreement, including but not limited to the number of jobs created or retained and the amount of investment made by the employer. The economic development authority shall, in response to receiving such information from the pilot project city, assess the level of compliance by each employer and provide to the pilot project city recommendations for either maintaining employer compliance with the withholding agreement or terminating the agreement for noncompliance under paragraph “g”. The economic development authority shall also provide each such assessment and recommendation report to the department of revenue.\n\ng. If the economic development authority, following an eighteen-month performance period beginning on the date the withholding agreement is approved by the authority board, determines that the employer ceases to meet the requirements of the withholding agreement relating to retaining jobs, if applicable, the agreement shall be terminated by the economic development authority and the pilot project city and any withholding credits for the benefit of the employer shall cease. If the economic development authority, following a three-year performance period beginning on the date the withholding agreement is approved by the authority board, determines that the employer has not or is incapable of meeting the requirements of the withholding agreement relating to creating jobs, if applicable, or the requirement of the withholding agreement relating to the qualifying investment prior to the end of the withholding agreement, the economic development authority may reduce the future benefits to the employer under the agreement or negotiate with the other parties to terminate the agreement early. Notice shall be provided promptly by the pilot project city to the department of revenue following termination of a withholding agreement.\n\nh. A pilot project city shall certify to the department of revenue the amount of the targeted jobs withholding credit an employer has remitted to the city and shall provide other information the department may require.\n\ni. An employee whose wages are subject to a withholding agreement shall receive full credit for the amount withheld as provided in section 422.16.\n\nj. An employer may participate in a new jobs credit from withholding under section 260E.5, or a supplemental new jobs credit from withholding under section 15E.197, Code 2014, or under section 15.331, Code 2005, at the same time as the employer is participating in the withholding credit under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, the new jobs credit from withholding under section 260E.5, and the supplemental new jobs credit from withholding under section 15E.197, Code 2014, or under section 15.331, Code 2005, shall be collected and disbursed prior to the withholding credit under this section.\n\nk. (1) A pilot project city entering into a withholding agreement shall arrange for matching local financial support for the project. The local match required under this paragraph “k” shall be in an amount equal to one dollar for every dollar of withholding credit received by the pilot project city.\n\n(2) For purposes of this paragraph “k”, “local financial support” means cash or in-kind contributions to the project from a private donor, a business, or the pilot project city.\n\n(3) If the project, when completed, will increase the amount of an employer’s taxable capital investment by an amount equal to at least ten percent of the amount of withholding credit dollars received by the pilot project city, then the pilot project city shall itself contribute at least ten percent of the local match amount computed under subparagraph (1).\n\n(4) If the project, when completed, will not increase the amount of an employer’s taxable capital investment by an amount at least equal to ten percent of the amount of withholding credit dollars received by the pilot project city, then the pilot project city shall not be required to make a contribution to the local match.\n\n(5) A pilot project city’s contribution, if any, to the local match may include the dollar value of any tax abatement provided by the city to the business for new construction.\n\nl. At the time of submitting its budget to the department of management, the pilot project city shall submit to the department of management and the economic development authority a description of the activities involving the use of withholding agreements. The description shall include but is not limited to the following:\n\n(1) The total number of targeted jobs and a breakdown as to those that are Iowa business expansions or retentions within the city limits of the pilot project city and those that are jobs resulting from established out-of-state businesses moving to or expanding in Iowa.\n\n(2) The number of withholding agreements and the amount of withholding credits involved.\n\n(3) The types of businesses that entered into agreements, and the types of businesses that declined the city’s proposal to enter into an agreement.\n\nm. The economic development authority in consultation with the department of revenue shall coordinate the pilot project program with the pilot project cities under this section. The economic development authority is authorized to adopt, amend, and repeal rules to implement the pilot project program under this section.\n\n2006 Acts, ch 1141, §1; 2007 Acts, ch 2, §1, 2; 2007 Acts, ch 126, §63; 2008 Acts, ch 1122, §15; 2009 Acts, ch 103, §1, 2; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §37, 38; 2011 Acts, ch 118, §81, 85, 89; 2011 Acts, ch 131, §126 – 129; 2012 Acts, ch 1018, §1; 2013 Acts, ch 111, §1 – 6; 2014 Acts, ch 1130, §35; 2017 Acts, ch 160, §12; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §31; 2019 Acts, ch 152, §45; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §71\n\nReferred to in §2.48",

With respect to any urban renewal area established upon the determination that the area is an economic development area, a division of revenue as provided in section 403.19 shall not be allowed for the purpose of providing or aiding in the provision of public improvements related to housing and residential development, unless the municipality assures that the project will include assistance for low and moderate income family housing.\n\na. For a municipality with a population over fifteen thousand, the amount to be provided for low and moderate income family housing for such projects shall be either equal to or greater than the percentage of the original project cost that is equal to the percentage of low and moderate income residents for the county in which the urban renewal area is located as determined by the United States department of housing and urban development using section 8 guidelines or by providing such other amount as set out in a plan adopted by the municipality and approved by the economic development authority if the municipality can show that it cannot undertake the project if it has to meet the low and moderate income assistance requirements.

The assistance to low and moderate income housing may be in, but is not limited to, any of the following forms:\n\na. Lots for low and moderate income housing within or outside the urban renewal area.\n\nb. Construction of low and moderate income housing within or outside the urban renewal area.\n\nc.
