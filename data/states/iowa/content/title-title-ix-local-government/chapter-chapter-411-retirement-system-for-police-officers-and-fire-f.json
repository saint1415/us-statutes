However, this subparagraph does not apply to more than eight additional years of service.\n\n(2) For a member who terminates service, other than by death or disability, on or after July 1, 1991, but before October 16, 1992, and who does not withdraw the member’s contributions pursuant to section 411.23, upon the member’s retirement there shall be added six-tenths percent of the member’s average final compensation for each year of service over twenty-two years, excluding years of service after the member’s fifty-fifth birthday. However, this subparagraph does not apply to more than eight additional years of service.\n\n(3) For a member who terminates service, other than by death or disability, on or after October 16, 1992, but before July 1, 1998, and who does not withdraw the member’s contributions pursuant to section 411.23, upon the member’s retirement there shall be added six-tenths percent of the member’s average final compensation for each year of service over twenty-two years. However, this subparagraph does not apply to more than eight additional years of service.\n\n(4) For a member who terminates service, other than by death or disability, on or after July 1, 1998, but before July 1, 2000, and who does not withdraw the member’s contributions pursuant to section 411.23, upon the member’s retirement there shall be added one and one-half percent of the member’s average final compensation for each year of service over twenty-two years. However, this subparagraph does not apply to more than eight additional years of service.\n\n(5) For a member who terminates service, other than by death or disability, on or after July 1, 2000, and who does not withdraw the member’s contributions pursuant to section 411.23, upon the member’s retirement there shall be added two percent of the member’s average final compensation for each year of service over twenty-two years. However, this subparagraph does not apply to more than eight additional years of service.\n\n3. Ordinary disability retirement benefit. Upon application to the system, of a member in good standing or of the chief of the police or fire departments, respectively, any member in good standing shall be retired by the system, not less than thirty and not more than ninety days next following the date of filing the application, on an ordinary disability retirement allowance, if the medical board after a medical examination of the member certifies that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired. However, if a person’s membership in the system first commenced on or after July 1, 1992, the member shall not be eligible for benefits with respect to a disability which would not exist, but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that membership commenced. A medical condition shall be deemed to have been known to exist on the date that membership commenced if the medical condition is reflected in any record or document completed or obtained in accordance with the system’s medical protocols pursuant to section 400.8, or in any other record or document obtained pursuant to an application for disability benefits from the system, if such record or document existed prior to the date membership commenced. A member who is denied a benefit under this subsection, by reason of a finding by the medical board that the member is not mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, shall be entitled to be restored to active service in the same position held immediately prior to the application for disability benefits. The member-in-good-standing requirement of this subsection may be waived for good cause as determined by the board. The burden of establishing good cause is on the member.\n\n4. Allowance on ordinary disability retirement.\n\na. Upon retirement for ordinary disability prior to July 1, 1998, a member shall receive an ordinary disability retirement allowance which shall consist of a pension which shall equal fifty percent of the member’s average final compensation unless either of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) If the member has not had five or more years of membership service, the member shall receive a pension equal to one-fourth of the member’s average final compensation.\n\n(2) If the member has had twenty-two or more years of membership service, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance that is equal to the greater of the benefit that the member would receive under subsection 2 if the member were fifty-five years of age or the disability pension otherwise calculated under this subsection.\n\nb. Upon retirement for ordinary disability on or after July 1, 1998, a member who has five or more years of membership service shall receive a disability retirement allowance in an amount equal to the greater of fifty percent of the member’s average final compensation or the retirement allowance that the member would receive under subsection 2 if the member had attained fifty-five years of age. A member who has less than five years of membership service shall receive a pension equal to one-fourth of the member’s average final compensation.\n\n5. Accidental disability benefit.\n\na. Upon application to the system, of a member in good standing or of the chief of the police or fire departments, respectively, any member in good standing who has become totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or while acting pursuant to order, outside of the city by which the member is regularly employed, shall be retired by the system if the medical board certifies that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired. However, if a person’s membership in the system first commenced on or after July 1, 1992, the member shall not be eligible for benefits with respect to a disability which would not exist, but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that membership commenced. A medical condition shall be deemed to have been known to exist on the date that membership commenced if the medical condition is reflected in any record or document completed or obtained in accordance with the system’s medical protocols pursuant to section 400.8, or in any other record or document obtained pursuant to an application for disability benefits from the system, if such record or document existed prior to the date membership commenced. A member who is denied a benefit under this subsection, by reason of a finding by the medical board that the member is not mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, shall be entitled to be restored to active service in the same position held immediately prior to the application for disability benefits.\n\nb. If a member in service or the chief of the police or fire departments becomes incapacitated for duty as a natural or proximate result of an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by the actual performance of duty at some definite time or place or while acting, pursuant to order, outside the city by which the member is regularly employed, the member, upon being found to be temporarily incapacitated following a medical examination as directed by the city, is entitled to receive the member’s full pay and allowances from the city’s general fund or trust and agency fund until reexamined as directed by the city and found to be fully recovered or until the city determines that the member is likely to be permanently disabled. If the temporary incapacity of a member continues more than sixty days, or if the city expects the incapacity to continue more than sixty days, the city shall notify the system of the temporary incapacity. Upon notification by a city, the system may refer the matter to the medical board for review and consultation with the member’s treating physician during the temporary incapacity. Except as provided by this paragraph, the board of trustees of the statewide system has no jurisdiction over these matters until the city determines that the disability is likely to be permanent.\n\nc. (1) Disease under this subsection shall mean heart disease or any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of strain or the inhalation of noxious fumes, poison, or gases.\n\n(2) Disease under this subsection shall also mean cancer or infectious disease and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of that duty.\n\n(3) However, if a person’s membership in the system first commenced on or after July 1, 1992, and the heart disease, disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, cancer, or infectious disease would not exist, but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that membership commenced, the presumption established in this paragraph “c” shall not apply.\n\nd. The requirement that a member be in good standing to apply for and receive a benefit under this subsection may be waived for good cause as determined by the board. The burden of establishing good cause is on the member.\n\n6. Retirement after accident.\n\na. Upon retirement for accidental disability prior to July 1, 1990, a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance which shall consist of a pension equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the member’s average final compensation.\n\nb. Upon retirement for accidental disability on or after July 1, 1990, but before July 1, 1998, a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance which shall consist of a pension equal to sixty percent of the member’s average final compensation. However, if the member has had twenty-two or more years of membership service, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance that is equal to the greater of the retirement allowance that the member would receive under subsection 2 if the member was fifty-five years of age or the disability retirement allowance calculated under this paragraph.\n\nc. Upon retirement for accidental disability on or after July 1, 1998, a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance which shall consist of a pension in an amount equal to the greater of sixty percent of the member’s average final compensation or the retirement allowance that the member would receive under subsection 2 if the member had attained fifty-five years of age.\n\n7. Reexamination of beneficiaries retired on account of disability. The system may, and upon the member’s application shall, require any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained age fifty-five to undergo a medical examination at a place designated by the medical board. The examination shall be made by the medical board or, in special cases, by an additional physician or physicians designated by such board. If any disability beneficiary who has not attained the age of fifty-five refuses to submit to the medical examination, the member’s allowance may be discontinued until withdrawal of such refusal, and if the refusal continues for one year all rights in and to the member’s pension may be revoked by the system. For a disability beneficiary who has not attained the age of fifty-five and whose entitlement to a disability retirement commenced on or after July 1, 2000, the medical board may, as part of the examination required by this subsection, suggest appropriate medical treatment or rehabilitation if, in the opinion of the medical board, the recommended treatment or rehabilitation would likely restore the disability beneficiary to duty.\n\na. (1) Should any beneficiary for either ordinary or accidental disability, except a beneficiary who is fifty-five years of age or over, be engaged in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the member’s net retirement allowance and one and one-half times the earnable compensation of an active member at the same position on the salary scale within the member’s rank as the member held at retirement, then the amount of the member’s retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount such that the member’s net retirement allowance plus the amount earned by the member shall equal one and one-half times the amount of the current earnable compensation of an active member at the same position on the salary scale within the member’s rank as the member held at retirement. Should the member’s earnings be later changed, the amount of the member’s retirement allowance may be further modified, provided that the new retirement allowance shall not exceed the amount of the retirement allowance adjusted by annual readjustments of pensions pursuant to subsection 12 of this section nor an amount which would cause the member’s net retirement allowance, when added to the amount earned by the beneficiary, to equal one and one-half times the amount of the earnable compensation of an active member at the same position on the salary scale within the member’s rank as the member held at retirement. A beneficiary restored to active service at a salary less than the average final compensation upon the basis of which the member was retired at age fifty-five or greater, shall not again become a member of the retirement system and shall have the member’s retirement allowance suspended while in active service. If the rank or position held by the retired member is subsequently abolished, adjustments to the allowable limit on the amount of income which can be earned in a gainful occupation shall be computed by the board of trustees as though such rank or position had not been abolished and salary increases had been granted to such rank or position on the same basis as increases granted to other ranks and positions in the department. For purposes of this paragraph, “net retirement allowance” means the amount determined by subtracting the amount paid during the previous calendar year by the beneficiary for health insurance or similar health care coverage for the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s dependents from the amount of the member’s retirement allowance paid for that year pursuant to this chapter. The beneficiary shall submit sufficient documentation to the system to permit the system to determine the member’s net retirement allowance for the applicable year.\n\n(2) A beneficiary retired under this lettered paragraph, in order to be eligible for continued receipt of retirement benefits, shall no later than May 15 of each year submit to the system a copy of the beneficiary’s federal individual income tax return for the preceding year. The beneficiary shall also submit, within a reasonable period of time, any documentation requested by the system that is determined to be necessary by the system to determine the beneficiary’s gross wages.\n\n(3) Retroactive to July 1, 1976, the limitations on pay of a member engaged in a gainful occupation who is retired under accidental disability prescribed in this paragraph shall not apply to a member who retired before July 1, 1976.\n\nb. Should a disability beneficiary under age fifty-five be restored to active service at a compensation not less than the disability beneficiary’s average final compensation, the disability beneficiary’s retirement allowance shall cease, the disability beneficiary shall again become a member and shall contribute thereafter at the rate established in section 411.8, and former service on the basis of which the disability beneficiary’s service was computed at the time of retirement shall be restored to full force and effect and upon subsequent retirement the disability beneficiary shall be credited with all service as a member and also with the period of disability retirement.\n\nc. Should a disability beneficiary under age fifty-five be employed in a public safety occupation, the disability beneficiary’s retirement allowance shall cease. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if a disability beneficiary is employed in a public safety occupation that would otherwise constitute membership service, the disability beneficiary shall not become a member of the system. For purposes of this paragraph, “public safety occupation” means a peace officer, as defined in section 97A.1; a protection occupation, as defined in section 97B.49B; a sheriff or deputy sheriff as defined in section 97B.49C; and a police officer or fire fighter as defined in section 411.1, who was not restored to active service as provided by this subsection.\n\n8. Ordinary death benefit.\n\na. Upon the receipt of proof of the death of a member in service, or a member not in service who has completed four or more years of service as provided in subsection 1, paragraph “b”, there shall be paid to the person designated by the member to the system as the member’s beneficiary, if the member has had one or more years of membership service and no pension is payable under subsection 9, the greater of the following:\n\n(1) An amount equal to fifty percent of the compensation earnable by the member during the year immediately preceding the member’s death if the member is in service, or an amount equal to fifty percent of the compensation earned by the member during the member’s last year of service if the member is not in service.\n\n(2) An amount the member would have been entitled to withdraw pursuant to section 411.23 if the member had terminated service on the date of the member’s death.\n\nb. (1) In lieu of the payment specified in paragraph “a”, a beneficiary meeting the qualifications of paragraph “c” may elect to receive a monthly pension equal to one-twelfth of forty percent of the average final compensation of the member, but not less than twenty percent of the average monthly earnable compensation paid to an active member of the system, as reported by the actuary. For a member not in service at the time of death, the pension shall be reduced as provided in subsection 1, paragraph “b”.\n\n(2) For a member not in service at the time of death, the pension shall be paid commencing when the member would have attained the age of fifty-five except that if there is a child of the member, the pension shall be paid commencing with the member’s death until the child of the member no longer meets the definition of child as provided in section 411.1. The pension shall resume when the member would have attained the age of fifty-five.\n\n(3) For a member in service at the time of death, the pension shall be paid commencing with the member’s death. In addition to the pension, there shall also be paid for each child of a member, a monthly pension equal to six percent of the average monthly earnable compensation paid to an active member of the system, as reported by the actuary.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding section 411.6, subsection 8, Code 1985, effective July 1, 1990, for a member’s surviving spouse who, prior to July 1, 1986, elected to receive pension benefits under this paragraph, the monthly pension benefit shall be equal to the higher of one-twelfth of forty percent of the average final compensation of the member, or the amount the surviving spouse was receiving on July 1, 1990.\n\nc. The pension under paragraph “b” may be selected only by the following beneficiaries:\n\n(1) The spouse, regardless of whether the spouse was designated by the member to the system as the member’s beneficiary.\n\n(2) If there is no spouse, or if the spouse dies and there is a child of a member, then the member’s child or children, in equal shares. The pension to each child shall terminate when the child no longer meets the definition of child in section 411.1.\n\nd. If the member failed to designate a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary designated by the member predeceases the member, the benefits provided in paragraph “a” of this subsection shall be paid as follows in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) To the member’s surviving spouse, unless the surviving spouse selected the pension under paragraph “b”.\n\n(2) To the member’s surviving children, including any adult children, in equal shares.\n\n(3) To the member’s surviving parents, in equal shares.\n\n(4) To the member’s estate.\n\n(5) To the member’s heirs if the estate is not probated.\n\n9. Accidental death benefit.\n\na. (1) If, upon the receipt of evidence and proof from the chief of the police or fire department that the death of a member in service was the natural and proximate result of an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or while acting pursuant to order, outside of the city by which the member is regularly employed, the system decides that death was so caused in the performance of duty, there shall be paid, in lieu of the ordinary death benefit provided in subsection 8, an accidental death benefit as set forth in this subsection.\n\n(2) (a) Disease under this subsection shall mean heart disease or any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of strain or the inhalation of noxious fumes, poison, or gases.\n\n(b) Disease under this subsection shall also mean cancer or infectious disease and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of that duty.\n\nb. (1) If the member’s designated beneficiary is the member’s spouse, child, or parent, an accidental death benefit pension equal to one-half of the average final compensation of the member shall be paid as follows:\n\n(a) If the member’s designated beneficiary is the member’s spouse, then to the member’s spouse.\n\n(b) If the member’s designated beneficiary is the member’s child or children, then to the child or children in equal shares. The pension to each child shall terminate when the child no longer meets the definition of child in section 411.1.\n\n(c) If the member’s designated beneficiary is the member’s dependent father or mother, or both, then to the father or mother, or both, in equal shares, to continue until death.\n\n(2) If the member failed to designate a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary designated by the member predeceases the member, then an accidental death benefit pension equal to one-half of the average final compensation of the member shall be paid as follows:\n\n(a) To the member’s spouse.\n\n(b) If there is no spouse, or if the spouse dies and there is a child of the member, then to the member’s child or children in equal shares. The pension to each child shall terminate when the child no longer meets the definition of child in section 411.1.\n\n(c) If there is no surviving spouse or child, then to the member’s dependent father or mother, or both, in equal shares, to continue until death.\n\nc. In addition to the accidental death benefit pension provided in paragraph “b”, there shall also be paid for each child of a member a monthly pension equal to six percent of the average monthly earnable compensation paid to an active member of the system, as reported by the actuary.\n\nd. A person eligible to receive the pension payable under paragraph “b” of this subsection may elect to receive the benefit payable under subsection 8, paragraph “a”, in lieu of the pension provided in paragraph “b” of this subsection.\n\ne. If there is no person entitled to the pension payable under paragraph “b” of this subsection, the death shall be treated as an ordinary death case and the benefit payable under subsection 8, paragraph “a”, in lieu of the pension provided in paragraph “a” of this subsection, shall be paid as provided by that subsection.\n\n10. Pensions offset by compensation benefits. Any amounts which may be paid or payable by the said cities under the provisions of any workers’ compensation or similar law to a member or to the dependents of a member on account of any disability or death, shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable under the provisions of this chapter on account of the same disability or death. In addition, any amounts payable to a member as unemployment compensation under the provisions of chapter 96 based on unemployment from membership service for a member receiving an ordinary disability benefit or an accidental disability benefit pursuant to this chapter shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable under the provisions of this chapter for an ordinary disability or an accidental disability.\n\n11. Pension to spouse and children of deceased pensioned member. In the event of the death of any member receiving a retirement allowance under the provisions of subsection 2, 4, or 6 of this section there shall be paid a pension:\n\na. To the spouse, equal to one-half the amount received by the deceased beneficiary, but in no instance less than twenty percent of the average monthly earnable compensation paid to an active member of the system, as determined by the actuary, and in addition a monthly pension equal to the monthly pension payable under subsection 9 of this section for each child; or\n\nb.

Annual readjustment of pensions. Pensions payable under this section shall be adjusted as follows:\n\na. On each July 1, the monthly pensions authorized in this section payable to members retired prior to that date and to beneficiaries entitled to a monthly pension prior to that date shall be adjusted as provided in this subsection. An amount equal to the sum of one and one-half percent of the monthly pension of each retired member and beneficiary and the applicable incremental amount shall be added to the monthly pension of each retired member and beneficiary. The board of trustees may report to the general assembly, at the board’s discretion, on whether the provisions of this subsection continue to provide an equitable method for the annual readjustment of pensions payable under this chapter.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, “applicable incremental amount” means the following amount for members receiving a pension under subsection 2, 4 or 6, and for beneficiaries receiving a pension under subsection 11:\n\n(1) Fifteen dollars where the member’s retirement date was less than five years prior to the effective date of the increase.\n\n(2) Twenty dollars where the member’s retirement date was at least five years, but less than ten years, prior to the effective date of the increase.\n\n(3) Twenty-five dollars where the member’s retirement date was at least ten years, but less than fifteen years, prior to the effective date of the increase.\n\n(4) Thirty dollars where the member’s retirement date was at least fifteen years, but less than twenty years, prior to the effective date of the increase.\n\n(5) Thirty-five dollars where the member’s retirement date was at least twenty years prior to the effective date of the increase.\n\nc. For beneficiaries receiving a pension under subsection 8 or 9, the applicable incremental amount shall be determined as set forth in paragraph “b”, except that the date of the member’s death shall be substituted for the member’s retirement date.\n\nd. A retired member eligible for benefits under subsection 1 of this section is not eligible for the readjustment of pensions provided in this subsection unless the member served twenty-two years and attained the age of fifty-five years prior to the member’s termination of employment.\n\ne. A retired member eligible for benefits under this section and otherwise eligible for the readjustment of benefits provided in this subsection is not eligible for the readjustment unless the member was retired on or before the effective date of the readjustment.\n\n13. a. Remarriage of surviving spouse. Effective July 1, 1990, for a member who died prior to July 1, 1988, if the member’s surviving spouse remarried prior to July 1, 1988, the remarriage does not make the spouse ineligible under subsection 8, paragraph “c”, subparagraphs (1) and (2), to receive benefits under subsections 8, 9, 11, and 12.\n\nb. Recomputation of benefit — surviving spouse. A benefit payable under this chapter to a surviving spouse and to any surviving spouse who receives a division of the surviving spouse benefit pursuant to a marriage decree or marital property order under section 411.13 shall not be recomputed upon the death of any surviving spouse.\n\n14. Beneficiary designation. A member may designate, in writing on a form prescribed by the system, any person or persons to whom the system will pay a death benefit under this section in the event of the member’s death. If the member is married at the time a designation is signed, a designation of a beneficiary other than the member’s spouse shall not be valid unless the member’s spouse consents in writing to the designation. A designation filed with the system shall be deemed revoked if, subsequent to the designation, a new designation is filed with the system, the member marries, or the member divorces the individual who was the member’s named beneficiary.\n\n15. Line of duty death benefit.\n\na. If, upon the receipt of evidence and proof from the chief of the police or fire department that the death of a member in service was the direct and proximate result of a traumatic personal injury incurred in the line of duty, the system decides that death was so caused, there shall be paid, to a person authorized to receive an accidental death benefit as provided in subsection 9, paragraph “b”, the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, which shall be payable in a lump sum.

Ineligibility for disability benefits.\n\na. A member otherwise eligible to receive a disability retirement benefit under this chapter shall not be eligible to receive such a benefit if the system determines that any of the following conditions for ineligibility applies:\n\n(1) The disability would not exist but for the member’s chemical dependency on a schedule I controlled substance, as defined in section 124.204, or the member’s chemical dependency on a schedule II controlled substance, as defined in section 124.206, resulting from the inappropriate use of the schedule II controlled substance. For purposes of this subparagraph, “chemical dependency” means an addiction or dependency, either physical or psychological, on a chemical substance. Persons who take medically prescribed drugs shall not be considered chemically dependent if the drug is medically prescribed and the intake is proportionate to the medical need.\n\n(2) The disability is a mental disability proximately caused by appropriate disciplinary actions taken against the member, or by conflicts with a superior or coworker if the superior or coworker was acting legally and appropriately toward the member when the conflicts occurred.\n\nb. A member otherwise eligible to receive a disability retirement benefit under this chapter, or who is receiving such a benefit, shall not be eligible to receive such a benefit beginning with the month following the determination by the system that the disability would not exist but for the action of the member for which the member has been convicted of a felony.\n\nc. A member eligible to commence receiving a disability benefit on or after July 1, 2000, may be ineligible to receive a disability retirement benefit if the system determines that the member’s alcoholism or drug addiction was a contributing factor material to the determination of the member’s disability. Upon a determination that the member’s alcoholism or drug addiction was a contributing factor in the member’s disability, the system shall direct the member to undergo substance use disorder treatment that the medical board determines is appropriate to treat the member’s alcoholism or drug addiction. After the end of a twenty-four-month period following the member’s first month of entitlement to a disability benefit, the system shall reevaluate the member’s disability. If the system determines that the member failed to comply with the treatment program prescribed by this paragraph and that the member would not be disabled but for the member’s alcoholism or drug addiction, the member’s entitlement to a disability benefit under this chapter shall terminate effective the first day of the first month following the month the member is notified of the system’s determination.\n\n17. Limitations on benefits — prisoners.\n\na. An individual who is otherwise entitled to a retirement allowance under this chapter shall not receive a retirement allowance for any month during which both of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) The individual is confined in a jail, prison, or correctional facility pursuant to the individual’s conviction of a felony.\n\n(2) The individual has a spouse, or a child or children, as defined in section 411.1.\n\nb.

The board of trustees shall adopt rules under section 411.5, subsection 3, providing the optional forms of payment that may be selected by the member. The optional forms of payment may provide adjustments to the amount of the retirement allowance paid to the member, may alter the pension amount and period of payment to the member’s spouse after the death of the member, and may provide for payments to a designated recipient other than the member’s spouse for a designated period of time or an unlimited period of time.\n\n2. Prior to the member’s retirement and as a part of the application for a service retirement allowance, the member shall elect, in writing, either the benefits provided under section 411.6, subsections 2 and 11, or one of the optional forms adopted by the board of trustees.

As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, and to the extent permitted by the internal revenue service:\n\na. “Direct rollover” means a payment by the system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the member or the member’s surviving spouse, or the member’s alternate payee under a marital property order who is the member’s spouse or former spouse.\n\nb. (1) “Eligible retirement plan” means any of the following that accepts an eligible rollover distribution from a member, a member’s surviving spouse, or a member’s alternate payee:\n\n(a) An individual retirement account in accordance with section 408(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(b) An individual retirement annuity in accordance with section 408(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(2) In addition, an “eligible retirement plan” includes an annuity plan in accordance with section 403(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust in accordance with section 401(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, that accepts an eligible rollover distribution from a member. Effective January 1, 2002, the term “eligible retirement plan” also includes an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that chooses to separately account for amounts rolled over into such eligible retirement plan from the system.\n\nc. “Eligible rollover distribution” means all or any portion of a member’s account, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any of the following:\n\n(1) A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, which occur annually or more frequently, made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or made for a specified period of ten years or more.\n\n(2) A distribution to the extent that the distribution is required pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(3) The portion of any distribution that is not includible in the gross income of the distributee, determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities. Provided, however, that effective January 1, 2002, such distributions may be directly rolled over to an individual retirement account described in federal Internal Revenue Code section 408(a) or 408(b), a qualified defined contribution plan described in federal Internal Revenue Code section 401(a), or a qualified annuity plan described in federal Internal Revenue Code section 403(a), if such plan agrees to separately account for the after-tax amount so rolled over.\n\n(4) A distribution of less than two hundred dollars of taxable income.\n\n2. Effective January 1, 1993, a member or a member’s surviving spouse may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed in rules adopted by the board of trustees, to have the system pay all or a portion of an eligible rollover distribution directly to an eligible retirement plan, specified by the member or the member’s surviving spouse, in a direct rollover. If a member or a member’s surviving spouse elects a partial direct rollover, the amount of funds elected for the partial direct rollover must equal or exceed five hundred dollars.\n\n3. a. For distributions after December 31, 2009, a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary may roll over all or any portion of the beneficiary’s distribution to an individual retirement account the beneficiary establishes for purposes of receiving the distribution by means of a direct rollover. In order to qualify for a rollover under this subsection, the distribution must otherwise satisfy the definition of an eligible rollover distribution. If a nonspouse beneficiary receives a distribution from the system, the distribution is not eligible for a sixty-day rollover.\n\nb. If the member’s named beneficiary is a trust, the system may make a direct rollover to an individual retirement account on behalf of the trust, provided the trust satisfies the requirements to be a designated beneficiary within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(E).\n\nc. A nonspouse beneficiary may not roll over an amount which is a required minimum distribution, as determined under applicable United States treasury regulations and other federal Internal Revenue Service guidance. If the participant dies before the participant’s required beginning date and the nonspouse beneficiary rolls over to an individual retirement account the maximum amount eligible for rollover, the beneficiary may elect to use either the five-year rule or the life expectancy rule, pursuant to applicable United States treasury regulations as provided in\n\n26 C.F.R. §1.401(a)(9)-3\n\n, in determining the required minimum distributions from the individual retirement account that receives the nonspouse beneficiary’s distribution.\n\n94 Acts, ch 1183, §73; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §67, 73; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180; 2010 Acts, ch 1167, §48\n\nReferred to in §411.6C, 411.23",

In addition, the eligible member shall receive the moneys credited to the member’s participant account while participating in the plan. The eligible member shall select, upon written application to the system, whether to receive the amount in the member’s participant account in the form of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 411.6B.\n\nc. If an eligible member terminates participation in the plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the death or disability of the member under this chapter, then the system shall assess a twenty-five percent penalty on the amount credited to the member’s participant account prior to distributing the amount to the member. The penalty amount shall be transferred to and remain with the fire and police retirement fund.\n\n3. To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall make written application to the system. The application shall include the following:\n\na. The month the eligible member intends to commence participation in the plan.\n\nb. The eligible member’s selection of a plan termination date. The plan termination date shall be either three, four, or five years after the date the eligible member commences membership in the plan. However, for the two-year period beginning April 1, 2007, an eligible member between sixty-two and sixty-four years of age may also select a plan termination date that is one or two years after the date the eligible member commences membership in the plan.\n\n4. Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not guarantee continued employment. Contributions required from members and participating cities shall continue based on the earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in the plan. However, contributions made while an eligible member participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund and shall not be subject to a withdrawal of contributions under section 411.23.\n\n5. The system’s actuary, while making the annual valuation of the assets and liabilities of the fire and police retirement fund, shall determine whether establishment and operation of the plan created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system. If the actuary determines that the plan has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system, then, notwithstanding any provision of section 411.8 to the contrary, the system shall increase the members’ contribution rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan created in this section.\n\n6. This section shall not be implemented until the system has received a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the plan as provided in this section. Upon receiving the favorable ruling, the board shall establish the implementation date of the plan.\n\n2006 Acts, ch 1073, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1026, §127",

On account of each member there shall be paid annually into the fund by the participating cities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the earnable compensation of the member to be known as the “normal contribution”. The rate percent of such contribution shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system as shown by annual actuarial valuations.\n\nb. (1) On the basis of the actuarial methods and assumptions, rate of interest, and of the mortality, interest and other tables adopted by the system, the actuary engaged by the system to make each valuation required by this chapter pursuant to the requirements of section 411.5, shall immediately after making such valuation, determine the normal contribution rate. Except as otherwise provided in this lettered paragraph, the “normal contribution rate” shall be the rate percent of the earnable compensation of all members equal to the rate required by the system to discharge its liabilities, stated as a percentage of the earnable compensation of all members, and reduced by the employee contribution rate provided in paragraph “f” of this subsection and the contribution rate representing any state appropriation made.

The contribution rate increases specified in 1994 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183, pursuant to this chapter and chapter 97A shall be the only member contribution rate increases for these systems resulting from the statutory changes enacted in 1994 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183, and shall apply only to the fiscal periods specified in 1994 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183.

If such an action is commenced, the plaintiff member, estate, or representative shall serve a copy of the original notice upon the retirement system not less than ten days before the trial of the action, but a failure to serve the notice does not prejudice the rights of the retirement system, and the following rights and duties ensue:\n\na. The retirement system shall be indemnified out of the recovery of damages to the extent of benefit payments paid or awarded by the retirement system, with legal interest, except that the plaintiff member’s or estate’s attorney fees may be first allowed by the district court. For purposes of this paragraph, “benefit payments paid or awarded” means the sum of the following amounts:\n\n(1) The amount of benefits actually paid by the retirement system up to the time of the entering of the judgment.\n\n(2) The present worth, computed at the interest rate provided in section 535.3 for court judgments and decrees, of the future payments of such benefits, for which the retirement system is liable, but the sum is not a final adjudication of the future payments which the member is entitled to receive.\n\nb. The retirement system has a lien on the damage claim against the third party and on any judgment on the damage claim for benefits for which the retirement system is liable. In order to continue and preserve the lien, the retirement system shall file a notice of the lien within thirty days after receiving a copy of the original notice in the office of the clerk of the district court in which the action is filed.\n\n3. Before a settlement is effective between the retirement system and a third party who is liable for an injury or death, the member or beneficiary must consent in writing to the settlement; and if the settlement is between the member or the member’s estate and a third party, the retirement system must consent in writing to the settlement; or on refusal to consent, in either case, the district court in the county in which either the city or the retirement system is located must consent in writing to the settlement.\n\n4. For purposes of subrogation under this section, a payment made to an injured member, a member’s estate, or the legal representative of the member or member’s estate, by or on behalf of a third party or the third party’s principal or agent, who is liable for, connected with, or involved in causing the injury or death of the member, shall be considered paid as damages because the injury or death was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability against the third party, whether the payment is made under a covenant not to sue, compromise settlement, denial of liability, or is otherwise made.\n\n86 Acts, ch 1203, §5; 88 Acts, ch 1158, §71; 98 Acts, ch 1183, §95, 96; 2000 Acts, ch 1077, §109; 2000 Acts, ch 1232, §69; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §68",

(1) Transfer from each terminated city fire or police retirement system to the statewide system amounts sufficient to cover the accrued liabilities of that terminated system as determined by the actuary of the statewide system. The actuary of the statewide system shall redetermine the accrued liabilities of the terminated systems as necessary to take into account additional amounts payable by the city which are attributable to errors or omissions which occurred prior to January 1, 1992, or to matters pending as of January 1, 1992. If the actuary of the statewide system determines that the assets transferred by a terminated system are insufficient to fully fund the accrued liabilities of the terminated system as determined by the actuary as of January 1, 1992, the participating city shall pay to the statewide system an amount equal to the unfunded liability plus interest for the period beginning January 1, 1992, and ending with the date of payment or the date of entry into an amortization agreement pursuant to this section. Interest on the unfunded liability shall be computed at a rate equal to the greater of the actuarial interest rate assumption on investments of the moneys in the fund or the actual investment earnings of the fund for the applicable calendar year.

The actuary of the statewide system shall determine if the assets of a terminated city fire or police retirement system would exceed the amount sufficient to cover the accrued liabilities of that terminated system as of January 1, 1992, using the alternative assumptions and the proposed assumptions.\n\n3. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, “alternative assumptions” means that the interest rate earned on investments of moneys in the fire and police retirement fund would be seven percent and that the state would not contribute to the fund under section 411.8 and section 411.20, Code 2009, after January 1, 1992, and “proposed assumptions” means that the interest rate earned on investments of moneys in the fire and police retirement fund would be seven and one-half percent and the state will pay contributions as provided pursuant to section 411.8 and section 411.20, Code 2009, after January 1, 1992. These assumptions are to be used solely for the purposes of this section, and shall not impact upon decisions of the board of trustees concerning the assumption of the interest rate earned on investments, or the contributions by the state as provided for in section 411.8 and section 411.20, Code 2009.\n\n4.

The city council may approve use of the excess funds to reduce only the city’s contribution to the statewide system, or the city council may approve use of the excess funds to reduce the city’s contribution and the members’ contributions to the statewide system. If the city council approves use of the excess funds to reduce both the city’s and the members’ contributions, the members shall not withdraw the portion of the members’ contributions paid from excess funds, as would otherwise be authorized in accordance with section 411.23.\n\n5. If the determination by the actuary using the alternative assumptions reflects that the assets of the terminated system do not exceed the amount sufficient to cover the accrued liabilities as of January 1, 1992, but a determination by the actuary using the proposed assumptions reflects that the assets of the terminated system do exceed the amount sufficient to cover the accrued liabilities as of January 1, 1992, all excess funds as determined utilizing the proposed assumptions and the interest and earnings from those excess funds shall be used only to reduce the city’s contribution rate to the statewide system.
