The title of an administrative agency must be appropriate to its function. The council may not delegate to an administrative agency any of the powers, authorities, and duties prescribed in subchapter V of chapter 384 or in chapter 388, except that the council may delegate to an administrative agency established for the purpose of operating an airport any of its powers and duties prescribed in subchapter V of chapter 384, and the council may delegate to an administrative agency power to establish and collect charges, and disburse the moneys received for the use of a city facility, including a city enterprise, as defined in section 384.24, if the delegation to an administrative agency is strictly subject to the limitations imposed by the revenue bonds or pledge orders outstanding which are payable from the revenues of the city enterprise. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the council may delegate rulemaking authority to the agency for matters within the scope of the agency’s powers and duties, and may prescribe penalties for violation of agency rules which have been adopted by ordinance. Rules governing the use by the public of any city facility must be made readily available to the public.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §392.1]\n\n95 Acts, ch 21, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1041, §127",
