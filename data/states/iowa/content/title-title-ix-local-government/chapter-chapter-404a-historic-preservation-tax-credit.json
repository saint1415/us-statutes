Any consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall not be included as income under chapter 422, subchapters II, III, and V.

A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax credit. As used in this subsection, “taxpayer” includes an eligible taxpayer or a person transferred a tax credit certificate pursuant to subsection 3.\n\n5. a. To claim a tax credit under this section, a taxpayer shall include one or more tax credit certificates with the taxpayer’s tax return.\n\nb.

The tax credit certificate, unless rescinded by the authority, shall be accepted by the department of revenue as payment for taxes imposed in chapter 422, subchapters II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, subject to any conditions or restrictions placed by the authority or the department of revenue upon the face of the tax credit certificate and subject to the limitations of this program.\n\n6.
