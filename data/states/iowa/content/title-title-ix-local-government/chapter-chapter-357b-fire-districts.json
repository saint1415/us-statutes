Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the board of supervisors shall negotiate agreements necessary to provide continued fire protection to the benefited fire district area during the time the district is being dissolved and after dissolution, and shall continue to levy an annual tax to fund such agreements, until such time as the township trustees of the township where the benefited fire district is located begin to provide fire protection service as required by section 359.42.\n\n2. If a benefited fire district is dissolved that has been providing fire protection by contract, direct levy, or combination of both, to a city within the district for at least twenty years and the city’s annual payments by contract or levy for the fire protection comprise seventy-five percent or more of the district’s annual budget, the board of supervisors, in lieu of the disposal of property as provided in subsection 1, shall transfer to the city all of the district’s real and personal property. The city shall assume all of the outstanding obligations of the district.
