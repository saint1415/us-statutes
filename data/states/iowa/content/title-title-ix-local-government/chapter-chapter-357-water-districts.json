A benefited water district established under this chapter may give notice of intent to provide water service to a new area within two miles of a city by submitting a water plan to the city. The plan is only required to indicate the area within two miles of the city which the benefited water district intends to serve. If the city fails to respond to the benefited water district’s plan within ninety days of receipt of the plan, the benefited water district may provide service in the area designated in the plan. The city may inform the benefited water district within ninety days of receipt of the plan that the city requires additional time or information to study the question of providing water service outside the limits of the city. If additional time or information is required, the city shall respond to the benefited water district’s plan within one hundred eighty days of receipt of the plan. In responding to the plan, the city may waive its right to provide water service within the areas designated for service by the benefited water district, or the city may reserve the right to provide water service in some or all of the areas which the benefited water district intends to serve. If the city reserves the right to provide water service within some or all of the areas which the benefited water district intends to serve, the city shall provide service within four years of receipt of the plan.
