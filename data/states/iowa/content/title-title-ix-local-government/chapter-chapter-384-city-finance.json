An amendment which extends the boundaries of a district, increases the amount to be assessed against a lot, or adds additional public improvements, is not effective until an amended plat, schedule, and estimate have been prepared and adopted, a notice published and mailed to all affected property owners, and hearing held in the same manner as the original proceedings, or until all affected property owners agree in writing to the change. The adoption of a resolution of necessity is a legislative determination that the improvement is expedient and proper and that property assessed will be specially benefited by the improvement and this determination of the council is conclusive. Ownership of property to be assessed by an improvement does not, except for fraud or bad faith, disqualify a council member from voting on any measure.\n\n3. After adopting the resolution of necessity, the clerk shall certify to the county treasurer of each county in which the assessed property is located, a copy of the resolution of necessity, the plat, and the schedule of assessments. In counties in which taxes are collected in two or more places, the resolution of necessity, the plat, and the schedule of assessments shall be certified to the office of county treasurer where the special assessments are collected. The county treasurer shall preserve the resolution, plat, and schedule as a part of the records of the office until the city certifies the final assessment schedule as provided in section 384.60 or certifies that the public improvement has been abandoned.\n\n[C73, §466; C97, §793, 794, 810, 811, 965; S13, §792-b, 793, 965; SS15, §810, 840-m; C24, 27, §5996, 5999, 6915; C31, 35, §5996, 5999, 6610-c15, 6610-c16, 6915, 6915-c1; C39, §5996, 5999, 6610.26, 6610.28, 6915, 6915.1; C46, §391.23, 391.26, 417.15, 417.16, 420.267, 420.268; C50, §391.23, 391.26, 391A.11, 417.15, 417.16, 420.267, 420.268; C54, 58, 62, §391.23, 391.26, 391A.14, 417.15, 417.16, 420.267, 420.268; C66, 71, 73, §390A.12, 391.23, 391.26, 391A.14, 417.15, 417.16, 420.267, 420.268; C75, 77, 79, 81, §384.51; 82 Acts, ch 1104, §15]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1241, §10; 89 Acts, ch 39, §11; 2017 Acts, ch 54, §76\n\nReferred to in §331.552, 357E.11A, 384.54, 384.65",

The following must be filed with the petition in the office of the clerk of the court:\n\na. A copy of the resolution of necessity as adopted by the council.\n\nb. A copy of the proposed schedule of assessments as adopted by the council under sections 384.48 and 384.51, which schedule shows the maximum amount that the council proposes to assess against any lot.\n\nc. Preliminary plans and specifications, or, if available, detailed plans and specifications as prepared by the engineer.\n\nd. A copy of the proposed contract if prepared.\n\n3. Notice of the filing of the petition must be given in the same manner as is provided for service of original notice by publication by the rules of civil procedure, except as follows:\n\na. No affidavit of inability to obtain personal service within the state of Iowa is required.\n\nb. The original notice must name as defendants those property owners who, on the date of filing the petition, have an interest in the real property to be assessed as a part of the public improvement, and the original notice must state that a plat and schedule is on file in the office of the clerk of the district court where the action is pending. No property owner is an indispensable party to the action. Publication of plat and schedule as part of the original notice is not required, nor shall reference in the original notice to specific descriptions of affected real property or the amounts of proposed assessments be necessary.\n\n4. The petition must be given precedence over any other business of the court, except criminal cases. The court shall set the petition for hearing within thirty days from the date of final publication of notice. As a part of its order, the court may provide for a pretrial conference to be held not earlier than twenty days from the date of final publication of notice and require the appearance at the pretrial conference of all interested parties. Failure to appear at the pretrial conference may be grounds for dismissing any objection.\n\n5. If no person having an interest in property proposed to be assessed has entered an appearance or filed an answer within the time set for hearing on the petition, the court shall confirm the assessment, and order the clerk of court to certify its decree to the city clerk.\n\n6. If any person having an interest in property proposed to be assessed has entered an appearance or filed an answer to the petition, the court shall hear the cause as an action triable in equity.\n\n7. Upon the hearing the court may correct any irregularities or inequalities in valuations or in the schedule of assessments, and shall consider any objections because of alleged illegal procedure or fraud.\n\n8. The court shall render a decision upon the hearing as soon as practical after the final submission of the cause.\n\n9. The clerk of the court shall certify to the city clerk the final action of the court, within three days from the date of the final decree upon the petition, showing assessments as confirmed in the schedule of assessments.\n\n10. An appeal from the decree of the district court must be taken as in other equity cases.\n\n11. A contract may or may not be let, in the discretion of the council, until appeals are finally determined, but the appeals need not delay the letting and execution of a contract for the work, if the council concludes the appeals were not taken in good faith.\n\n12. An appeal does not, in the discretion of the council, delay the certification of an assessment or progress of an improvement, but upon decision of the appeal the assessment appealed from must be corrected and collected in the same manner as provided in section 384.74.\n\n13. Corrections of assessments or valuations made by order of the district court are conclusive and not subject to review on appeal, or otherwise, except as provided in subsections 10 through 12 of this section.

The cost of all court proceedings are a legitimate item of expense in connection with a public improvement, and may be included within the final assessment against any property specially benefited in the assessment district.\n\nb. Whenever on a hearing by the court, the amount of any assessment is reduced or canceled so that there is a deficiency in the total amount remaining assessed in the proceeding, the court may assess the deficiency to the city or distribute the deficiency upon the other property abutting upon or adjacent to the improvement or in the district assessed, in a manner the court finds to be just and equitable, not exceeding, however, the amount the property would be specially benefited by the improvement, and not exceeding twenty-five percent of the value of the lot as shown by the plat and schedule of assessments or as reduced by the court.\n\n[C31, 35, §6610-c28, -c31, -c32, -c34 – c40, -c42 – c44, -c56; C39, §6610.31 – 6610.33, 6610.36 – 6610.41, 6610.43, 6610.44, 6610.46, 6610.65, 6610.67; C46, 50, §417.28, 417.31, 417.32, 417.34 – 417.40, 417.42 – 417.44, 417.60; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, §391A.18, 417.28, 417.31, 417.32, 417.34 – 417.40, 417.42 – 417.44, 417.60; C75, 77, 79, 81, §384.54]\n\n2010 Acts, ch 1069, §128 – 130; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §237\n\nReferred to in §357E.11A",

However, the total principal amount of bonds issued for a public improvement may not exceed the total amount of unpaid special assessments less the proportionate unpaid amount assessed for the default fund.\n\n2. All special assessment bonds are negotiable, must state on their face that they are issued under the provisions of this subchapter, and are payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of the special assessments levied for the public improvement. Such bonds may bear interest at a rate not exceeding that permitted by chapter 74A payable annually or semiannually, must mature serially on December 1 of the years in which any of the principal is scheduled to become due, and may contain a provision that the city reserves the right and option of calling and redeeming any or all of the bonds prior to maturity on any interest payment date or within forty-five days thereafter upon the terms specified therein. Such bonds must be called “improvement bonds”, must designate the general type of improvement or improvements for which issued, and may be issued in any denomination, not exceeding ten thousand dollars. Bonds issued for a public improvement authorized in section 384.38, subsection 2, must be named in a way to distinguish them from other improvement bonds of the city, and to designate the property specially assessed for the improvement. Improvement bonds issued for any one levy must bear the same date and be divided into as many series as there are years in which installments of the special assessment mature, and each series must be as nearly equal in amount as practicable.\n\n3. The proceeds of the special assessments and interest collected thereon must be used and applied by the city to the payment of the interest on the bonds and to the retirement of the principal as rapidly as proceeds are collected. Such bonds and coupons do not make the city liable in any way, except for the proper application of special assessments. If interest becomes due on any of the bonds when there is no fund or funds from which to pay it, the council may make a temporary loan for payment of the interest, which loan must be repaid from the special assessments and interest pledged to secure the bonds, but in case of purchase by the city at tax sale of the property on which a special assessment is levied, the loan must be repaid from the funds of the city from which deficiencies on the improvement were paid, or if there were no deficiencies, from the general fund.\n\n4. Special assessment bonds must be sold at public or private sale in the manner provided by chapter 75, and may not be sold for less than par value with accrued interest from date to the time of delivery, or if no bids are received at public sale, bonds bearing the same rate of interest as the special assessment may be delivered to the contractor in payment of the cost of the public improvement. The proceeds of the sale must be applied to the payment of the cost of the public improvement.\n\n5. Any excess of proceeds from special assessments remaining after all of the bonds for a particular improvement have been paid with interest may be credited to the fund from which deficiencies for the improvement could have been paid. However, any excess in a default fund established for a public improvement authorized in section 384.38, subsection 2, shall be held by the city in a special fund to guarantee other improvement bonds which may be issued by the city for public improvements authorized under that section.\n\n6. Cities may issue refunding bonds to pay off and take up special assessment bonds issued in payment for public improvements, or to refund any part thereof, as follows:\n\na. Refunding bonds must substantially conform to the provisions of this subchapter, and the face value is limited to the amount of the unpaid special assessments with the interest thereon of the particular issue of bonds to be refunded.\n\nb.

The city shall collect the special assessment out of which the refunding bonds are payable and hold the proceeds in trust for the payment of the refunding bonds, but it is not liable except for the proper application of the assessments.\n\n7. No action shall be brought questioning the legality of the bonds authorized by this section from and after sixty days from the date the bonds are ordered issued by the city.\n\n[C97, §842, 843, 845, 847, 987; C24, §6109 – 6113, 6117, 6118, 6121 – 6124, 6925, 6932; C27, §5942-b3, 6066-a11, 6109 – 6113, 6117, 6118, 6121 – 6124, 6126-a1 – a6, 6925, 6932; C31, 35, §5942-b3, 6066-a11, 6109 – 6113, 6117, 6118, 6121 – 6124, 6126-a1 – a6, 6610-c65, -c66, 6925, 6932; C39, §5942.3, 6066.13, 6109 – 6113, 6117, 6118, 6121 – 6124, 6126.1 – 6126.6, 6610.71, 6610.72, 6925, 6932; C46, §389.7, 392.11, 396.6 – 396.10, 396.14, 396.15, 396.18 – 396.21, 396.24 – 396.29, 417.68, 417.69, 420.278, 420.285; C50, §389.7, 391A.30, 392.11, 396.6 – 396.10, 396.14, 396.15, 396.18 – 396.21, 396.24 – 396.29, 417.68, 417.69, 420.278, 420.285; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, §389.7, 391A.33, 392.11, 396.6 – 396.10, 396.14, 396.15, 396.18 – 396.21, 396.24 – 396.29, 417.68, 417.69, 420.278, 420.285; C75, 77, 79, 81, §384.68]\n\n2018 Acts, ch 1041, §127\n\nReferred to in §357E.11A",

A combined utility system or combined city enterprise may be established, but if there are obligations outstanding which by their terms are payable from the revenues of any city utility or city enterprise involved, all such outstanding obligations must be assumed by the governing body of the combined utility system or combined city enterprise subject to all terms established at the time of the original issue, or refunded through the issuance of revenue bonds of the combined utility system or combined city enterprise as a part of the procedure for the establishment of the combined utility system or combined city enterprise, or funds sufficient to pay the principal of and all interest and premium, if any, on such outstanding obligations at and prior to maturity must have been properly set aside and pledged for that purpose. Any revenues earmarked for payment of the obligations must be handled by the governing body of the combined utility or combined city enterprise in the same manner as they were handled by the governing body of the city utility or city enterprise involved. A city utility or city enterprise may not be abandoned and a combined utility system or combined city enterprise may not be dissolved so long as there are obligations outstanding which by their terms are payable from the revenues of the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise unless funds sufficient to pay the principal of and all interest and premium, if any, on such outstanding obligations at and prior to maturity have been properly set aside and pledged for such purpose.\n\n[C73, §471 – 473; C97, §720; S13, §720; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §6127; C46, 50, 54, §390.1, 397.1; C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, §386B.2, 390.1, 397.1; C75, 77, 79, 81, §384.81]\n\nReferred to in §26.9, 357E.11A, 389.4, 390.5",

A city may carry out projects, borrow money, and issue revenue bonds and pledge orders to pay all or part of the cost of projects, which may include a qualified water resource restoration project, such revenue bonds and pledge orders to be payable solely and only out of the net revenues of the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise involved in the project. The cost of a project includes the construction contracts, interest upon the revenue bonds and pledge orders during the period or estimated period of construction and for twelve months thereafter, or for twelve months after the acquisition date, such reserve funds as the governing body may deem advisable in connection with the project and the issuance of revenue bonds and pledge orders, and the costs of engineering, architectural, technical and legal services, preliminary reports, surveys, property valuations, estimates, plans, specifications, notices, acquisition of real and personal property, consequential damages or costs, easements, rights-of-way, supervision, inspection, testing, publications, printing and sale of bonds and provisions for contingencies. A city may sell revenue bonds or pledge orders at public or private sale in the manner prescribed by chapter 75 and may deliver revenue bonds and pledge orders to the contractors, sellers, and other persons furnishing materials and services constituting a part of the cost of the project in payment therefor.\n\nb. A city may deliver its revenue bonds to the federal government or any agency thereof which has loaned the city money for sanitary or solid waste projects, water projects or other projects for which the government has a loan program.\n\n2. A city may issue revenue bonds or pledge orders to refund revenue bonds, pledge orders, and other obligations which are by their terms payable from the net revenues of the same city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise, or from a city utility comprising a part of the combined utility system or a city enterprise comprising a part of the combined city enterprise, at lower, the same, or higher rates of interest. Upon a finding of necessity by the governing body, a city may issue revenue bonds or pledge orders to refund general obligation bonds to the extent the general obligation bonds were issued or the proceeds of them were expended for a city utility, city enterprise, or a portion of a combined city utility or city enterprise. These revenue bonds or pledge orders may be issued at lower, the same, or at higher rates of interest than the rates of the general obligation bonds being refunded. A city may sell refunding revenue bonds or pledge orders at public or private sale in the manner prescribed by chapter 75 and apply the proceeds to the payment of the obligations being refunded, and may exchange refunding revenue bonds or pledge orders in payment and discharge of the obligations being refunded. The principal amount of refunding revenue bonds or pledge orders may exceed the principal amount of the obligations being refunded to the extent necessary to pay a premium due on the call of the obligations being refunded, to fund interest accrued and to accrue on the obligations being refunded, to pay the costs of issuance of the refunding revenue bonds or pledge orders, and to fund such reserve funds as the governing body may deem advisable in connection with the issuance of the refunding revenue bonds or pledge orders.\n\n[C31, §6134-d1; C35, §5903-f4, 6066-f6, 6134-d1, -f1; C39, §5903.15, 6066.29, 6134.01 – 6134.03; C46, §385.4, 394.6, 397.9 – 397.11; C50, §385.4, 390.9, 394.6, 397.9 – 397.11; C58, 62, 66, §385.4, 386B.10, 390.9, 394.6, 397.9 – 397.11; C71, 73, §385.4, 386B.10, 390.9, 390.16, 394.6, 397.9 – 397.11; C75, 77, 79, 81, §384.82; 81 Acts, ch 126, §1]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1058, §1; 2009 Acts, ch 72, §5; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180\n\nReferred to in §26.9, 357E.11A, 389.4, 390.5",

A city may issue revenue bonds pursuant to a resolution of the governing body of the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise, adopted at a regular or special meeting by a majority of the total number of members to which the governing body is entitled.\n\n2. a. Before the governing body institutes proceedings for the issuance of revenue bonds, it shall fix a time and place of meeting at which it proposes to take action and give notice by publication in the manner directed in section 362.3. The notice must include a statement of the time and place of the meeting, the maximum amount of the proposed revenue bonds, the purpose or purposes for which the revenue bonds will be issued, and the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise whose net revenues will be used to pay the revenue bonds and interest on them. The governing body shall at the meeting receive oral or written objections from any resident or property owner of the city. After all objections have been received and considered, the governing body may, at the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting, take additional action for the issuance of the bonds or abandon the proposal to issue bonds. Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal a decision of the governing body to take additional action to the district court of the county in which any part of the city is located within fifteen days after the additional action is taken, but the additional action of the governing body is final and conclusive unless the court finds that the governing body exceeded its authority. The provisions of this subsection with respect to notice, hearing, and appeal in connection with the issuance of revenue bonds are in lieu of those contained in chapter 73A or any other law.\n\nb. Separate purposes may be incorporated in a single notice of intention to institute proceedings or separate purposes may be incorporated in separate notices and, after an opportunity for filing objections, the governing body may include in a single issue of revenue bonds any number or combination of purposes.\n\n3. Revenue bonds may bear dates, bear interest at rates not exceeding that permitted by chapter 74A, mature in one or more installments, be in either coupon or registered form, carry registration and conversion privileges, be payable as to principal and interest at times and places, be subject to terms of redemption prior to maturity with or without premium, and be in one or more denominations, all as provided by the resolution of the governing body authorizing their issuance. The resolution may also prescribe additional provisions, terms, conditions, and covenants which the governing body deems advisable, consistent with the provisions of the city code, including provisions for creating and maintaining reserve funds, the issuance of additional revenue bonds ranking on a parity with such revenue bonds and additional revenue bonds junior and subordinate to such revenue bonds, and that such revenue bonds shall rank on a parity with or be junior and subordinate to any revenue bonds which may be then outstanding. Revenue bonds are a contract between the city and holders and the resolution is a part of the contract.\n\n4. If the governing body is a city council, the revenue bonds must be executed by the mayor and clerk of the city. If the governing body is a utility board, the revenue bonds must be executed by the chairperson and secretary of the board. If coupons are attached to the revenue bonds, they must be executed with the original or facsimile signature of the clerk or secretary. A revenue bond is valid and binding for all purposes if it bears the signatures of the officers in office on the date of the execution of the bonds notwithstanding that any or all persons whose signatures appear thereon have ceased to be such officers prior to the delivery thereof. The issuance of revenue bonds must be recorded in the office of the city treasurer or other financial officer designated by the council, and a certificate of the recording by the treasurer or other officer must be printed on the back of each revenue bond.\n\n5. Revenue bonds and pledge orders issued pursuant to this subchapter are negotiable instruments.\n\n6. A city may issue pledge orders pursuant to a resolution of the governing body of the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise, adopted by a majority of the total number of members to which the governing body is entitled, at a regular or special meeting, ordering their issuance and delivery in payment for all or part of the cost of a project.

When revenue bonds or pledge orders are issued and outstanding pursuant to this subchapter, the governing body shall establish, impose, adjust, and provide for the collection of rates to produce gross revenues at least sufficient to pay the expenses of operation and maintenance of the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise, and to leave a balance of net revenues sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the revenue bonds and pledge orders as they become due and to maintain a reasonable reserve for the payment of principal and interest, and a sufficient portion of net revenues must be pledged for that purpose. Rates must be established by ordinance of the council or by resolution of the trustees, published in the same manner as an ordinance.\n\n2. The governing body of a city water or wastewater utility may enter into an agreement with a qualified entity to use proceeds from revenue bonds for a water resource restoration project if the rate imposed is no greater than if there was not a water resource restoration project agreement. For purposes of this subsection, “qualified entity” is an entity created pursuant to chapter 28E or two entities that have entered into an agreement pursuant to chapter 28E, whose purpose is to undertake a watershed project that has been approved for water quality improvements in the watershed.\n\n3. a. A city utility or enterprise service to a property or premises, including services of sewer systems, storm water drainage systems, sewage treatment, solid waste collection, water, solid waste disposal, or any of these services, may be discontinued or disconnected if the account for the service becomes delinquent. Gas or electric service provided by a city utility or enterprise shall be discontinued or disconnected only as provided by section 476.20, subsections 1 through 4, and discontinuance or disconnection of those services is subject to rules adopted by the utilities board.\n\nb.

A city utility or enterprise service to a property or premises shall not be discontinued or disconnected unless prior written notice is sent, by ordinary mail, to the account holder in whose name the delinquent rates or charges were incurred, informing the account holder of the nature of the delinquency and affording the account holder the opportunity for a hearing prior to discontinuance or disconnection of service. If the account holder is a tenant, and if the owner or landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the notice shall also be given to the owner or landlord. If the account holder is a tenant and requests a change of name for service under the account, such request shall be sent to the owner or landlord of the property if the owner or landlord has made a written request for notice of any change of name for service under the account to the rental property.\n\nd. (1) If a delinquent amount is owed by an account holder for a utility service associated with a prior property or premises, a city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise may withhold service from the same account holder at any new property or premises until such time as the account holder pays the delinquent amount owing on the account associated with the prior property or premises. A city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise shall not withhold service from, or discontinue or disconnect service to, a subsequent owner who obtains fee simple title of the prior property or premises unless such delinquent amount has been certified in a timely manner to the county treasurer as provided in subsection 4, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) and (2).\n\n(2) Delinquent amounts that have not been certified in a timely manner to the county treasurer are not collectible against any subsequent owner of the property or premises.\n\ne.

(1) A legal entity providing wastewater, sewer system, storm water drainage, or sewage treatment services to a city or cities or other political subdivisions pursuant to a franchise or other agreement shall have the same powers and duties as a city utility or enterprise under this subsection with respect to account holders and subsequent owners, or with respect to properties and premises, associated with a delinquent account under this subsection.\n\n(2) The governing body of a city utility, combined city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise may enter into an agreement with a legal entity described in subparagraph (1) to discontinue or disconnect water service to a property or premises if an account owed the legal entity for wastewater, sewer system, storm water drainage, or sewage treatment services provided to that customer’s property or premises becomes delinquent. The customer shall be responsible for all costs associated with discontinuing or disconnecting and reestablishing water service disconnected pursuant to this paragraph “f”.\n\n(3) This paragraph “f” shall not apply to a property or premises if, prior to July 1, 2015, the account holder for that property or premises had an established account with a legal entity described in subparagraph (1) for the provision of wastewater, sewer system, storm water drainage, or sewage treatment services to the property or premises.\n\n4. a.

The governing body of a city utility may, by resolution, delegate to a designee named in the resolution the city utility’s authority to certify unpaid rates or charges to the county treasurer. The city council of a city that is contracting with a city utility for joint billing or collection or both pursuant to chapter 28E may, by ordinance, delegate to such city utility, or the city utility’s designee, the city’s authority to certify unpaid rates or charges to the county treasurer.\n\n(2) If the delinquent rates or charges were incurred prior to the date a transfer of the property or premises in fee simple is filed with the county recorder and such delinquencies were not certified to the county treasurer prior to such date, the delinquent rates or charges are not eligible to be certified to the county treasurer. If certification of such delinquent rates or charges is attempted subsequent to the date a transfer of the property or premises in fee simple is filed with the county recorder, the county treasurer shall return the certification to the city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise attempting certification along with a notice stating that the delinquent rates or charges cannot be made a lien against the property or premises.\n\n(3) If the city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise is prohibited under subparagraph (2) from certifying delinquent rates or charges against the property or premises served by the services described in subparagraph (1), the city utility, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise may certify the delinquent rates or charges against any other property or premises located in this state and owned by the account holder in whose name the rates or charges were incurred.\n\n(4) A lien under subparagraph (1) shall not be placed upon a premises that is a mobile home, modular home, or manufactured home served by any of the services under that subparagraph if the mobile home, modular home, or manufactured home is owned by a tenant of and located in a mobile home park or manufactured home community and the mobile home park or manufactured home community owner or manager is the account holder, unless the lease agreement specifies that the tenant is responsible for payment of a portion of the rates or charges billed to the account holder.\n\nb. The lien under paragraph “a” may be imposed upon a property or premises even if a city utility or enterprise service to the property or premises has been or may be discontinued or disconnected as provided in this section.\n\nc. A lien for a city utility or enterprise service under paragraph “a” shall not be certified to the county treasurer for collection unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is given to the account holder in whose name the delinquent rates or charges were incurred at least thirty days prior to certification. If the account holder is a tenant, and if the owner or landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the notice shall also be given to the owner or landlord. The notice shall be sent to the appropriate persons by ordinary mail not less than thirty days prior to certification of the lien to the county treasurer.\n\nd. (1) Residential or commercial rental property where a charge for water service is separately metered and paid directly to the city utility or enterprise by the tenant is exempt from a lien for delinquent rates or charges associated with such water service if the landlord gives written notice to the city utility or enterprise that the property is residential or commercial rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges. A city utility or enterprise may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of ninety days of water service to be paid to the utility or enterprise. Upon receipt, the utility or enterprise shall acknowledge the notice and deposit. A written notice shall contain the name of the tenant responsible for charges, address of the residential or commercial rental property that the tenant is to occupy, and the date that the occupancy begins.\n\n(2) A change in tenant for a residential rental property shall require a new written notice to be given to the city utility or enterprise within thirty business days of the change in tenant. A change in tenant for a commercial rental property shall require a new written notice to be given to the city utility or enterprise within ten business days of the change in tenant. When the tenant moves from the rental property, the city utility or enterprise shall return the deposit if the water service charges are paid in full.\n\n(3) A change in the ownership of the residential rental property shall require written notice of such change to be given to the city utility or enterprise within thirty business days of the completion of the change of ownership. A change in the ownership of the commercial rental property shall require written notice of such change to be given to the city utility or enterprise within ten business days of the completion of the change of ownership.\n\n(4) The lien exemption for rental property does not apply to charges for repairs to a water service if the repair charges become delinquent.\n\ne. Residential rental property where a charge for any of the services of sewer systems, storm water drainage systems, sewage treatment, solid waste collection, and solid waste disposal is paid directly to the city utility or enterprise by the tenant is exempt from a lien for delinquent rates or charges associated with such services if the landlord gives written notice to the city utility or enterprise that the property is residential rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges. A city utility or enterprise may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of ninety days of the services of sewer systems, storm water drainage systems, sewage treatment, solid waste collection, and solid waste disposal to be paid to the utility or enterprise. A city utility or enterprise may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of sixty days of the services of gas and electric to be paid to the utility or enterprise. Upon receipt, the utility or enterprise shall acknowledge the notice and deposit. A written notice shall contain the name of the tenant responsible for the charges, the address of the residential rental property that the tenant is to occupy, and the date that the occupancy begins. A change in tenant shall require a new written notice to be given to the city utility or enterprise within thirty business days of the change in tenant.

A lien shall not be imposed pursuant to this section for a delinquent charge of less than five dollars. The governing body of the city utility or enterprise may charge up to five dollars, and the county treasurer may charge up to five dollars, as an administrative expense of certifying and filing this lien, which amounts shall be added to the amount of the lien to be collected at the time of payment of the assessment from the payor. Administrative expenses collected by the county treasurer on behalf of the city utility or enterprise shall be paid to the governing body of the city utility or enterprise, and those collected by the county treasurer on behalf of the county shall be credited to the county general fund. The lien has equal precedence with ordinary taxes, may be certified to the county treasurer and collected in the same manner as taxes, and is not divested by a judicial sale.\n\n6. a. The governing body of a city utility or city enterprise providing wastewater, sewer system, storm water drainage, or sewage treatment services may file suit in the appropriate court against a customer if the customer’s account for such services becomes delinquent pursuant to subsection 3. The governing body may recover the costs for providing such services to the customer’s property or premises and reasonable attorney fees actually incurred.\n\nb. A legal entity described in subsection 3, paragraph “e” or “f”, shall have the same powers and duties as a city utility or enterprise under paragraph “a” of this subsection with respect to filing suit in an appropriate court against a customer if the customer’s account for such services becomes delinquent.\n\n7. A governing body may declare all or a certain portion of a city as a storm water drainage system district for the purpose of establishing, imposing, adjusting, and providing for the collection of rates as provided in this section. The ordinance provisions for collection of rates of a storm water drainage system may prescribe a formula for determination of the rates which may include criteria and standards by which benefits have been previously determined for special assessments for storm water public improvement projects under this chapter.\n\n8. a. The governing body of a city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise may:\n\n(1) By ordinance of the council or by resolution of the trustees published in the same manner as an ordinance, establish, impose, adjust, and provide for the collection of charges for connection to a city utility or combined utility system.\n\n(2) Contract for the use of or services provided by a city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise with persons whose type or quantity of use or service is unusual.\n\n(3) Lease for a period not to exceed fifteen years all or part of a city enterprise or combined city enterprise, if the lease will not reduce the net revenues to be produced by the city enterprise or combined city enterprise.\n\n(4) Contract for a period not to exceed forty years with other governmental bodies for the use of or the services provided by the city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise on a wholesale basis.\n\n(5) Contract for a period not to exceed forty years with persons and other governmental bodies for the purchase or sale of water, gas, or electric power and energy on a wholesale basis.\n\nb. Two or more city utilities, combined utility systems, city enterprises, or combined city enterprises, including city utilities established pursuant to chapter 388, may contract pursuant to chapter 28E for joint billing or collection, or both, of combined service accounts for utility or enterprise services, or both. The contracts may provide for the discontinuance or disconnection of one or more of the city utility or enterprise services if a delinquency occurs in the payment of any charges billed under a combined service account.\n\nc.
