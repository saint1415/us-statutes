Be comprised of contiguous property wholly within the boundaries of the city. A self-supported municipal improvement district shall be comprised only of property in districts which are zoned for commercial or industrial uses and properties within a duly designated historic district.\n\nb. Be given a descriptive name containing the words “self-supported municipal improvement district”.\n\nc. Be comprised of property related in some manner, including but not limited to present or potential use, physical location, condition, relationship to an area, or relationship to present or potential commercial or other activity in an area, so as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of the property, by the condition, development or maintenance of the district or of any improvement or self-liquidating improvement of the district, or be comprised of property the owners of which have a present or potential benefit from the condition, development or maintenance of the district or of any improvement or self-liquidating improvement of the district.\n\n2. The council shall initiate proceedings for establishing a district upon the filing with its clerk of a petition containing:\n\na. The signatures of at least twenty-five percent of all owners of property within the proposed district. These signatures must together represent ownership of property with an assessed value of twenty-five percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.\n\nb. A description of the boundaries of the proposed district or a consolidated description of the property within the proposed district.\n\nc. The name of the proposed district.\n\nd. A statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be imposed upon property within the district. The maximum rate of tax may be stated in terms of separate maximum rates for the debt service tax, the capital improvement fund tax, and the operation tax, or in terms of a maximum combined rate for all three.\n\ne. The purpose of the establishment of the district, which may be stated generally, or in terms of the relationship of the property within the district or the interests of the owners of property within the district, or in terms of the improvements or self-liquidating improvements proposed to be developed for the purposes of the district, either specific improvements, self-liquidating improvements, or general categories of improvements, or any combination of the foregoing.\n\nf. A statement that taxes levied for the self-supported improvement district operation fund shall be used for the purpose of paying maintenance expenses of improvements or self-liquidating improvements for a specified length of time, along with any options to renew, if the taxes are to be used for this maintenance purpose.\n\n3. a. The council shall notify the city planning commission upon the receipt of a petition. It shall be the duty of the city planning commission to make recommendations to the council in regard to the proposed district. The city planning commission shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative report for the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The council shall not hold its public hearings or take further action on the establishment of the district until it has received the report of the city planning commission. In addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time, recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the project.\n\nb. If no city planning commission exists, the council shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission upon receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the same duties as the city planning commission set forth in this subsection. If no planning commission exists, the council shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the same duties as the city planning commission set forth in this subsection. If no planning or zoning commission exists, the council shall call a hearing on the establishment of a district upon receipt of a petition.\n\n4. Upon the receipt of the commission’s final report the council shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the council proposes to take action for the establishment of the district, and shall publish notice of the meeting as provided in section 362.3, and the clerk shall send a copy of the notice by certified mail not less than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property within the proposed district at the owner’s address as shown by the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council’s taking any action authorized in this chapter.\n\n5. In addition to the time and place of the meeting for hearing on the petition, the notice must state:\n\na. That a petition has been filed with the council asking that a district be established.\n\nb. The name of the district.\n\nc. The purpose of the district.\n\nd. The property proposed to be included in the district.\n\ne. The maximum rate of tax which may be imposed upon the property in the district.\n\n6. At the time and place set in the notice the council shall hear all owners of property in the proposed district or residents of the city desiring to express their views. The council must wait at least thirty days after the public hearing has been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district which must be comprised of all the property which the council finds has the relationship or whose owners have the interest described in subsection 1, paragraph “c”. Property included in the proposed district need not be included in the established district. However, no property may be included in the district that was not included in the proposed district until the council has held another hearing after it has published and mailed the same notice as required in subsections 4 and 5 of this section on the original petition to the owners of the additional property, or has caused a notice of the inclusion of the property to be personally served upon each owner of the additional property, or has received a written waiver of notice from each owner of the additional property.\n\n7. Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires the affirmative vote of three-fourths of all of the members of the council, or in cities having but three members of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at least twenty-five percent of all owners of property within the proposed district representing ownership of property with an assessed value of twenty-five percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the council.\n\n8. The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in which any property within the district is located.\n\n9. At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with its clerk containing the signatures of at least forty percent of all owners of property within the proposed district or signatures which together represent ownership of property with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed value of all property within the proposed district.\n\n10. The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district is a legislative determination that the property within the district has the relationship or its owners have the interest required under subsection 1, paragraph “c” and includes all of the property within the area which has that relationship or the owners of which have that interest in the district.\n\n11. Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal the action and the decisions of the council, including the creation of the district and the levying of the proposed taxes for the district, to the district court of the county in which any part of the district is located, within thirty days after the date upon which the ordinance creating the district becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the council exceeded its authority. No action may be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to the establishment of a district or the validity of the district, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of any property within or from the district, or the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the ordinance establishing the district, after thirty days from the date on which the ordinance creating the district becomes effective.\n\n12. The procedural steps for the petitioning and creation of the district may be combined with the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or self-liquidating improvement, or the procedural steps for the authorization of any tax, or any combination thereof.\n\n13. The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition and the ordinance creating the district shall only restrict the amount of bonds which may be issued, and shall not limit the ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of bonds.\n\n14. The ordinance creating the district may provide for the division of all of the property within the district into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the relationship of the property or the interest of its owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative. The ordinance creating the district and establishing the different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax for each zone, or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone shall be a certain set percentage of the tax levied in the zone which is subject to the highest rate of tax.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §386.3]\n\n85 Acts, ch 113, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1246, §7; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §180\n\nReferred to in §386.4, 386.6",

All property added to a district shall be subject to all taxes currently and thereafter levied including debt service levies for bonds previously or thereafter issued.\n\n2.

A city may issue and sell self-supported municipal improvement district bonds at public or private sale payable from taxes which must be levied in accordance with chapter 76. The bonds are payable from the levy of unlimited ad valorem taxes on all the taxable property within the district through the district debt service fund authorized by section 386.10. When self-supported municipal improvement district bonds are issued and taxes are levied in accordance with chapter 76, the taxes shall continue to be levied, until the bonds and interest thereon are paid in full, against all of the taxable property that was included in the district at the time of the issuance of the bonds, regardless of any subsequent removal of any property from the district or the dissolution of the district.\n\n2. The proceeds of the sale of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of any improvement, or be used to pay any legal indebtedness incurred for the cost of any improvement including bonds or warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement, or bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal indebtedness.\n\n3. Before the council may institute proceedings for the issuance of bonds, it shall proceed in the same manner as is required for the institution of proceedings for the issuance of bonds for an essential corporate purpose as provided in section 384.25, subsection 2 and all of the provisions of that subsection apply to bonds issued pursuant to this section.\n\n4. A city may issue bonds authorized by this section pursuant to a resolution adopted at a regular or special meeting by an affirmative vote of a majority of the total members to which the council is entitled. The proceeds of a single bond issue may be used for various improvements.\n\n5. The provisions of sections 384.29, 384.30, and 384.31 apply to bonds issued pursuant to this section, except that the bonds shall be designated “municipal improvement district bonds”.\n\n6. No action may be brought which questions the legality of bonds issued pursuant to this section or the power of a city to issue the bonds or the effectiveness of any proceedings relating to the authorization and issuance of the bonds after thirty days from the time the bonds are ordered issued by the city.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §386.11]\n\nReferred to in §386.10, 386.12",

The capital improvement fund referred to in section 386.9.\n\n2. The proceeds of bonds referred to in section 386.11.\n\n3. Any other funds of the city which are legally available to pay all or a portion of the cost of an improvement. The fact that an improvement is initiated under the provisions of this chapter, or any of the costs of an improvement or any part of an improvement are being paid under the provisions of this chapter, shall not preclude the city from paying any costs of an improvement from any fund from which it might otherwise have been able to pay such costs. In addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing, any improvement which constitutes an essential corporate purpose or a general corporate purpose as defined in section 384.24, subsections 3 and 4, may be financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the issuance of general obligation bonds of the city pursuant to the provisions of chapter 384, subchapter III.\n\n4. Payment for the costs of an improvement may also be made in warrants drawn on any fund from which payment for the improvement may be made. If such funds are depleted, anticipatory warrants may be issued bearing a rate of interest not exceeding that permitted by chapter 74A, which do not constitute a violation of section 384.10, even if the collection of taxes or income from the sale of bonds applicable to the improvement is after the end of the fiscal year in which the warrants are issued. If the city arranges for the private sale of anticipatory warrants, they may be sold and the proceeds used to pay the costs of the improvement. Such warrants may be used to pay other persons furnishing services constituting a part of the cost of the improvement.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §386.12]\n\n2018 Acts, ch 1041, §127",
