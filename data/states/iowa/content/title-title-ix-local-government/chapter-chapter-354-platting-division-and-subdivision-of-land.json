It is therefore determined to be in the public interest:\n\n1. To provide for accurate, clear, and concise legal descriptions of real estate in order to prevent, wherever possible, land boundary disputes or real estate title problems.\n\n2. To provide for a balance between the land use rights of individual landowners and the economic, social, and environmental concerns of the public when a city or county is developing or enforcing land use regulations.\n\n3. To provide for statewide, uniform procedures and standards for the platting of land while allowing the widest possible latitude for cities and counties to establish and enforce ordinances regulating the division and use of land, within the scope of, but not limited to, chapters 331, 335, 364, 414, and this chapter. All documents presented for recording pursuant to this chapter shall comply with section 331.606B.\n\n4. To encourage orderly community development and provide for the regulation and control of the extension of public improvements, public services, and utilities, the improvement of land, and the design of subdivisions, consistent with an approved comprehensive plan or other specific community plans, if any.\n\n90 Acts, ch 1236, §15\n\nC91, §409A.1\n\nC93, §354.1\n\n2001 Acts, ch 44, §12; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §46",

The surveyor shall not assign parcel letters or prepare a metes and bounds description for any parcel shown on a plat of survey unless the parcel was surveyed by the surveyor in compliance with chapter 355. Parcels within a plat of survey prepared pursuant to this section are subject to the regulations and ordinances of the governing body.\n\n3. When land or rights in land are divided for right-of-way purposes by an agency of the government or other persons having the power of eminent domain and the description of the land or rights acquired is a metes and bounds description then an acquisition plat shall be made and attached to the description when the acquisition instrument is recorded.

The notice shall be sent by ordinary mail, postmarked not less than seven days prior to the entry, or delivered personally. A mailing is deemed sufficient if the surveyor mails the required notice to the address of the landowner as contained in the property tax records. For civil liability purposes, receipt of this notice shall not be considered consent. This notice is not required for a survey along previously surveyed boundaries within a platted subdivision accepted or recorded by the federal government or an official plat as defined in section 354.2, subsection 12.\n\n4.

A land surveyor who enters on private land must comply with all biosecurity and restricted-access protocols established by the owner or occupant of the private land.\n\n7. A landowner or occupant shall owe the same duty to a land surveyor entering land without the consent of the landowner or occupant as the landowner or occupant would owe to a trespasser on that land.\n\n2009 Acts, ch 157, §1",
