Such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond.\n\n2.

For purposes of arriving at such tax equivalent, the property shall be valued and assessed by the assessor in whose jurisdiction the property is located, in accordance with chapter 441, but the municipality, the lessee on behalf of the municipality, and such other persons as are authorized by chapter 441 shall be entitled to protest any assessment and take appeals in the same manner as any taxpayer. Such valuations shall be included in any summation of valuations in the taxing district for all purposes known to the law. Income from this source shall be considered under the provisions of section 384.16, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2).\n\n2. If and to the extent the proceedings under which the bonds authorized to be issued under the provisions of this chapter so provide, the municipality may agree to cooperate with the lessee of a project in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings for determining the validity or amount of any such payments and may agree to appoint or designate and reserve the right in and for such lessee to take all action which the municipality may lawfully take in respect of such payments and all matters relating thereto, provided, however, that such lessee shall bear and pay all costs and expenses of the municipality thereby incurred at the request of such lessee or by reason of any such action taken by such lessee in behalf of the municipality. Any lessee of a project which has paid, as rentals additional to those required to be paid pursuant to section 419.5, the amounts required by subsection 1, paragraph “a”, to be paid by the municipality shall not be required to pay any such taxes to the state or to any such county, city, school district or other political subdivision, any other statute to the contrary notwithstanding. To the extent that any lessee or contracting party pays taxes on a project or part thereof, the municipality shall not be required to pay the tax equivalent herein provided, and to such extent the lessee or contracting party shall not be required to pay amounts to the municipality for such purpose.\n\n3. This section shall not be applicable to any municipality acquiring, purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, improving, or extending any buildings for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, or assisting any private or state of Iowa college or university, nor to any municipality in connection with any project for the benefit of a voluntary nonprofit hospital, clinic, or health care facility, the property of which is otherwise exempt under the provisions of chapter 427.
