If a person who was elected by write-in votes chooses not to serve in that office, the person shall submit a resignation in writing to the city clerk not later than 5:00 p.m. on the tenth day following the canvass of the election. If a person who was elected by write-in votes resigns at a later time, the office shall be considered vacant at the end of the term and the council shall fill the vacancy pursuant to the provisions of section 372.13, subsection 2.\n\n2. Except in cities where the council has chosen a runoff election in lieu of a primary, following the resignation of a person who was elected by write-in votes, the city clerk shall notify the person who received the next highest number of votes cast for the office that the person may assume the office. If there is more than one person who received the next highest number of votes cast for the office, lots shall be drawn pursuant to section 50.44 to determine the person who received the next highest number of votes. If the person accepts the position, the person shall be considered the duly elected officer unless, within ten days after the clerk has given notice, a petition requesting a special election is filed by eligible electors of the city equal in number to twenty-five percent of the number of persons who voted for the office at the election. If the person declines, the person shall do so in writing to the city clerk within ten days and the office shall be considered vacant at the end of the term. The vacancy shall be filled pursuant to the provisions of section 372.13, subsection 2. If the council chooses to appoint, the appointment may be made before the end of the current term.\n\n3. In city primary elections any person who receives write-in votes shall execute an affidavit in substantially the form required by section 45.3, and file it with the county commissioner of elections not later than 5:00 p.m. on the day after the canvass of the primary election. If any person who received write-in votes fails to file the affidavit at the time required, the county commissioner shall disregard the write-in votes cast for that person. A notation shall be made on the abstract of votes showing which persons who received write-in votes filed affidavits. The total number of votes cast for each office on the ballot shall be amended by subtracting the write-in votes of those candidates who failed to file the affidavit. It is not necessary for a candidate whose name was printed upon the ballot to file an affidavit. Of the remaining candidates, those who receive the highest number of votes to the extent of twice the number of unfilled positions shall be placed on the ballot for the regular city election as candidates for that office.\n\n4. In cities in which the city council has chosen a runoff election in lieu of a primary, if a person who was elected by write-in votes chooses not to accept the office by filing a resignation notice with the commissioner of elections not later than 5:00 p.m. on the day following the canvass, all remaining persons who received write-in votes and who wish to be considered candidates for the runoff election shall execute an affidavit in substantially the form required by section 45.3 and file it with the county commissioner not later than 5:00 p.m. of the fourth day following the canvass. If a person receiving write-in votes fails to file the affidavit at the time required, the county commissioner of elections shall disregard the write-in votes cast for that person. The abstract of votes shall be amended to show that the person who was declared elected declined the office and a notation shall be made next to the names of those persons who did not file the affidavit. A runoff election shall be held with the remaining candidates who have the highest number of votes to the extent of twice the number of unfilled positions.\n\n5. In a city in which the council has chosen a runoff election, if no person was declared elected for an office, all persons who received write-in votes shall execute an affidavit in substantially the form required by section 45.3 and file it with the county commissioner of elections not later than 5:00 p.m. on the day following the canvass of votes. If any person who received write-in votes fails to file the affidavit, the county commissioner of elections shall disregard the write-in votes cast for that person. The abstract of votes shall be amended to note which of the write-in candidates failed to file the affidavit. A runoff election shall be held with the remaining candidates who have the highest number of votes to the extent of twice the number of unfilled positions.\n\n[C77, 79, 81, §376.11]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1119, §42; 2007 Acts, ch 59, §18, 19; 2010 Acts, ch 1033, §54; 2014 Acts, ch 1101, §11\n\nReferred to in §372.13",
