      "text": "364.2 Vesting of power — franchises.\n\n1. A power of a city is vested in the city council except as otherwise provided by a state law.\n\n2. The enumeration of a specific power of a city does not limit or restrict the general grant of home rule power conferred by the Constitution of the State of Iowa. A city may exercise its general powers subject only to limitations expressly imposed by a state or city law.\n\n3. An exercise of a city power is not inconsistent with a state law unless it is irreconcilable with the state law.\n\n4. a. A city may grant to any person a franchise to erect, maintain, and operate plants and systems for electric light and power, heating, telegraph, cable television, district telegraph and alarm, motor bus, trolley bus, street railway or other public transit, waterworks, sewer services, or gasworks, within the city for a term of not more than twenty-five years. When considering whether to grant, amend, extend, or renew a franchise, a city shall hold a public hearing on the question. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published as provided in section 362.3. The franchise may be granted, amended, extended, or renewed only by an ordinance, but no exclusive franchise shall be granted, amended, extended, or renewed.\n\nb. Such an ordinance shall not become effective unless approved at an election. The proposal may be submitted by the council on its own motion to the voters at any city election. Upon receipt of a petition meeting the requirements of section 362.4 requesting that a proposal be submitted to the voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next regular city election or at a special election called for that purpose before the next regular city election. However, the city council may dispense with such election as to the grant, amendment, extension, or renewal of an electric light and power, heating, waterworks, sewer services under section 357A.23, or gasworks franchise unless there is a valid petition requesting submission of the proposal to the voters, or the party seeking such franchise, grant, amendment, extension, or renewal requests an election. If a majority of those voting approves the proposal, the city may proceed as proposed. The complete text of the ordinance shall be included on the ballot if conventional paper ballots are used. If an optical scan voting system is used, the proposal shall be stated on the optical scan ballot, and the full text of the ordinance posted for the voters pursuant to section 52.25. All absentee voters shall receive the full text of the ordinance.\n\nc. Notice of the election shall be given by publication as prescribed in section 49.53 in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.\n\nd. The person asking for the granting, amending, extension, or renewal of a franchise shall pay the costs incurred in holding the election, including the costs of the notice. A franchise shall not be finally effective until an acceptance in writing has been filed with the council and payment of the costs has been made.\n\ne. The franchise ordinance may regulate the conditions required and the manner of use of the streets and public grounds of the city, and it may, for the purpose of providing electrical, gas, heating, or water service, confer the power to appropriate and condemn private property upon the person franchised.\n\nf. (1) (a) A franchise fee assessed by a city may be based upon a percentage of gross revenues generated from sales of the franchisee within the city not to exceed five percent except as provided in subparagraph division (b), without regard to the city’s cost of inspecting, supervising, and otherwise regulating the franchise.\n\n(b) For franchise fees assessed and collected during fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2013, but before July 1, 2030, by a city that is the subject of a judgment, court-approved settlement, or court-approved compromise providing for payment of restitution, a refund, or a return described in section 384.3A, subsection 3, paragraph “j”, the rate of the franchise fee shall not exceed seven and one-half percent of gross revenues generated from sales of the franchisee in the city, and franchise fee amounts assessed and collected during such fiscal years in excess of five percent of gross revenues generated from sales shall be used solely for the purpose specified in section 384.3A, subsection 3, paragraph “j”. A city may assess and collect a franchise fee in excess of five percent of gross revenues generated from the sales of the franchisee pursuant to this subparagraph division (b) for a period not to exceed seven consecutive fiscal years once the franchise fee is first imposed at a rate in excess of five percent. An ordinance increasing the franchise fee rate to greater than five percent pursuant to this subparagraph division (b) shall not become effective unless approved at an election. After passage of the ordinance, the council shall submit the proposal at a special election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection 4, paragraph “b”. If a majority of those voting on the proposal approves the proposal, the city may proceed as proposed. The complete text of the ordinance shall be included on the ballot and the full text of the ordinance posted for the voters pursuant to section 52.25. All absentee voters shall receive the full text of the ordinance along with the absentee ballot. This subparagraph division (b) is repealed July 1, 2030.\n\n(2) Franchise fees collected pursuant to an ordinance in effect on May 26, 2009, shall be deposited in the city’s general fund and such fees collected in excess of the amounts necessary to inspect, supervise, and otherwise regulate the franchise may be used by the city for any other purpose authorized by law. Franchise fees collected pursuant to an ordinance that is adopted or amended on or after May 26, 2009, to increase the percentage rate at which franchise fees are assessed shall be credited to the franchise fee account within the city’s general fund and used pursuant to section 384.3A. If a city franchise fee is assessed to customers of a franchise, the fee shall not be assessed to the city as a customer. Before a city adopts or amends a franchise fee rate ordinance or franchise ordinance to increase the percentage rate at which franchise fees are assessed, a revenue purpose statement shall be prepared specifying the purpose or purposes for which the revenue collected from the increased rate will be expended. If property tax relief is listed as a purpose, the revenue purpose statement shall also include information regarding the amount of the property tax relief to be provided with revenue collected from the increased rate. The revenue purpose statement shall be published as provided in section 362.3.\n\n(3) When considering whether to amend an ordinance imposing a franchise fee to increase the rate of the fee, and after preparation of the revenue purpose statement under subparagraph (2), a city shall hold a public hearing on the question. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published as provided in section 362.3. If a city adopts, amends, or repeals an ordinance imposing a franchise fee, the city shall promptly notify the director of revenue of such action.\n\ng. If a city grants more than one cable television franchise, the material terms and conditions of any additional franchise shall not give undue preference or advantage to the new franchisee. A city shall not grant a new franchise that does not include the same territory as that of the existing franchise. A new franchisee shall be given a reasonable period of time to build the new system throughout the territory.\n\n5. If provided by ordinance, a city may enter into a chapter 28E agreement for the collection of delinquent parking fines by a county treasurer pursuant to section 321.40 at the time a person applies for renewal of a motor vehicle registration, for violations that have not been appealed or for which appeal has been denied. The city may pay the treasurer a reasonable fee for the collection of such fines, or may allow the county treasurer to retain a portion of the fines collected, as provided in the agreement.\n\n6. A city council may by ordinance or resolution prohibit or limit the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties, as described in section 727.2.\n\n[C51, §664; R60, §1047, 1056, 1057, 1090, 1094, 1095; C73, §454 – 456, 471, 473, 474, 517, 523, 524; C97, §695, 720 – 722, 775, 776; S13, §695, 720 – 722, 776; C24, 27, 31, 35, §5738, 5904, 5904-c1, 5905 – 5909, 6128, 6131 – 6134; C39, §5738, 5904, 5904.1, 5905 – 5909, 6128, 6131 – 6134; C46, 50, §368.1, 386.1 – 386.7, 397.2, 397.5 – 397.8; C54, 58, 62, 66, §368.2, 386.1 – 386.7, 388.5 – 388.9, 397.2, 397.5 – 397.8; C71, 73, §368.2, 386.1 – 386.7, 397.2, 397.5 – 397.8; C75, 77, 79, 81, §364.2]\n\n83 Acts, ch 127, §5; 93 Acts, ch 143, §49; 98 Acts, ch 1123, §15; 98 Acts, ch 1148, §1, 9; 2001 Acts, ch 82, §1; 2001 Acts, ch 98, §1; 2005 Acts, ch 54, §11, 12; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §96; 2007 Acts, ch 190, §42; 2009 Acts, ch 57, §89; 2009 Acts, ch 179, §228, 231; 2012 Acts, ch 1110, §24; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §148, 150; 2015 Acts, ch 118, §1; 2017 Acts, ch 29, §104; 2017 Acts, ch 50, §1, 2; 2017 Acts, ch 115, §8, 12\n\nReferred to in §306.46, 357A.23, 358C.13, 364.3, 364.4, 384.3A, 403.7, 477A.2, 477A.5, 480A.6, 714H.4\n\nFor future amendment to subsection 4, paragraph f, subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (b), effective July 1, 2024, see 2023 Acts, ch 71, §60, 62",

      "text": "364.3 Limitation of powers.\n\nThe following are limitations upon the powers of a city:\n\n1. A city council shall exercise a power only by the passage of a motion, a resolution, an amendment, or an ordinance.\n\n2. For a violation of an ordinance a city shall not provide a penalty in excess of the maximum fine and term of imprisonment for a simple misdemeanor under section 903.1, subsection 1, paragraph “a”. An amount equal to twenty percent of all fines collected by cities shall be deposited in the account established in section 602.8108.

The crime services surcharge required by section 911.1 shall be added to a city fine and is not a part of the city’s penalty.\n\n3. a. A city may not set standards and requirements which are lower or less stringent than those imposed by state law, but may set standards and requirements which are higher or more stringent than those imposed by state law, unless a state law provides otherwise.\n\nb. A city shall not impose any fee or charge on any individual or business licensed by the plumbing and mechanical systems board for the right to perform plumbing, mechanical, HVAC, refrigeration, sheet metal, or hydronic systems work within the scope of the license. This paragraph does not prohibit a city from charging fees for the issuance of permits for, and inspections of, work performed in its jurisdiction.\n\nc. (1) A city shall not adopt an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment that sets standards or requirements regarding the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise that are different from, or in addition to, any state law. For purposes of this paragraph:\n\n(a) “Consumer merchandise” means merchandise offered for sale or lease, or provided with a sale or lease, primarily but not exclusively for personal, family, or household purposes, and includes any container used for consuming, carrying, or transporting such merchandise.\n\n(b) “Container” means a bag, cup, package, container, bottle, or other packaging that is all of the following:\n\n(i) Designed to be either reusable or single-use.\n\n(ii) Made of cloth, paper, plastic, including foamed or expanded plastic, cardboard, corrugated material, aluminum, glass, or postconsumer recycled or similar material or substrates, including coated, laminated, or multilayer substrates.\n\n(iii) Designed for consuming, transporting, or protecting merchandise, food, or beverages from or at a food service or retail facility.\n\n(2) An ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment adopted prior to March 30, 2017, that violates this paragraph is void and unenforceable on and after March 30, 2017.\n\n(3) This paragraph “c” shall not apply to city solid waste or recycling collection or city solid waste or recycling programs.\n\nd.

This subsection does not preclude the investigation and abatement of a nuisance or the enforcement of a tiedown system, or the enforcement of any regulations of the council on health and human services or local board of health if those regulations apply to other rental properties or to owner-occupied housing intended for human habitation.\n\n6. A city shall not provide a civil penalty in excess of seven hundred fifty dollars for the violation of an ordinance which is classified as a municipal infraction or if the infraction is a repeat offense, a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each repeat offense.

Additionally, a city-operated cable communications system shall be required to pay the same fees and charges and comply with other requirements as may be imposed by the city by ordinance or by the terms of a franchise granted by the city, or as may otherwise be imposed by the city, upon any other cable provider. This subsection does not prohibit a city from making an equitable apportionment of franchise requirements between or among cable television providers, in order to eliminate duplication. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit a city-operated cable communications system from making transfers of surplus as otherwise allowed or from making in-kind contributions as otherwise allowed.\n\n8. a. A city may adopt and enforce an ordinance requiring the construction of a storm shelter at a manufactured home community or mobile home park which is constructed after July 1, 1999. In lieu of requiring construction of a storm shelter, a city may require a community or park owner to provide a plan for the evacuation of community or park residents to a safe place of shelter in times of severe weather including tornadoes and high winds if the city determines that a safe place of shelter is available within a reasonable distance of the manufactured home community or mobile home park for use by community or park residents. Each evacuation plan prepared pursuant to this subsection shall be filed with, and approved by, the local emergency management agency. If construction of a storm shelter is required, an ordinance adopted or enforced pursuant to this subsection shall not include any of the following requirements:\n\n(1) That the size of the storm shelter be larger than the equivalent of seven square feet for each manufactured or mobile home space in the manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\n(2) That the storm shelter include a restroom if the shelter is used exclusively as a storm shelter.\n\n(3) That the storm shelter exceed the construction specifications approved by a licensed professional engineer and presented by the owner of the manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\n(4) That the shelter be located any closer than one thousand three hundred twenty feet from any manufactured or mobile home in the community. However, this restriction shall not prohibit the adoption or enforcement of an ordinance that requires a minimum of one shelter to be located in a manufactured home community or mobile home park.\n\nb. For the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) “Manufactured home community” means the same as land-leased community defined in sections 335.30A and 414.28A.\n\n(2) “Mobile home park” means a mobile home park as defined in section 562B.7.\n\n(3) “Storm shelter” means a single structure or multiple structures designed to provide persons with temporary protection from a storm.\n\n9. A city shall not adopt or enforce any ordinance imposing any limitation on the amount of rent that can be charged for leasing private residential or commercial property. This subsection does not prevent the right of a city to manage and control residential property in which the city has a property interest.\n\n10. A city which operates a utility that furnishes gas or electricity shall manage the right-of-way on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. Such city utility shall be required to pay the fees and charges computed in the same manner as those fees and charges which are imposed by the city upon any other provider of a similar service within the corporate boundaries of the city. Such city utility shall also comply with the terms of the franchise granted by the city to the provider of a similar service. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the city utility from making transfers of surplus as otherwise allowed or from making in-kind contributions as otherwise allowed. However, a city shall not require that transfers from the city utility be in excess of the franchise fee amount imposed upon the provider of a similar service unless otherwise agreed.\n\n11.

(1) Paragraph “a” does not apply to an ordinance granting, extending, amending, or renewing a franchise pursuant to section 364.2, subsection 4, that does not restrict or impede the provision of natural gas service.\n\n(2) Paragraph “a” does not apply to an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment relating to the rates, services, or governance of a public utility providing gas service to the public for compensation and subject to the jurisdiction of the utilities board pursuant to section 476.1B.\n\n(3) Paragraph “a” does not apply to an ordinance, motion, resolution, or amendment that regulates a retail propane marketer or retail propane dispenser, as those terms are defined in section 101C.2, adopted before July 1, 2021.\n\n14.

Such an ordinance or regulation in effect on January 1, 2021, is void and unenforceable on and after January 1, 2023. For purposes of this subsection, “dwelling unit” means the same as defined in section 562A.6.\n\n17. a. A city that operates and maintains parking meters or non-metered parking lots shall not enforce any ordinance related to fees at such parking meters against, and shall not charge a fee at any non-metered parking lot to, a person whose vehicle is lawfully displaying any of the following registration plates:\n\n(1) Medal of honor special registration plates issued pursuant to section 321.34, subsection 8.\n\n(2) Ex-prisoner of war special registration plates issued pursuant to section 321.34, subsection 8A.\n\n(3) Purple heart special registration plates issued pursuant to section 321.34, subsection 18.\n\n(4) Registration plates displaying the alphabetical characters “DV” preceding the registration plate number pursuant to section 321.166, subsection 6.\n\nb.

A lease or lease-purchase contract entered into by a city may contain provisions similar to those sometimes found in leases between private parties, including, but not limited to, the obligation of the lessee to pay any of the costs of operation or ownership of the leased property and the right to purchase the leased property.\n\nc. A provision of a lease or lease-purchase contract which stipulates that a portion of the rent payments be applied as interest is subject to chapter 74A. Other laws relating to interest rates do not apply. Chapter 75 is not applicable. A city utility or city enterprise is a separate entity under this subsection whether it is governed by the governing body of the city or another governing body.\n\nd. The governing body must follow substantially the same authorization procedure required for the issuance of general obligation bonds issued for the same purpose to authorize a lease or a lease-purchase contract made payable from the debt service fund.\n\ne. The governing body may authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract which is payable from the general fund if the contract would not cause the total of annual lease or lease-purchase payments due from the general fund of the city in any single future fiscal year for all lease or lease-purchase contracts in force on the date of the authorization, excluding payments to exercise purchase options or to pay the expenses of operation or ownership of the property, to exceed ten percent of the last certified general fund budget amount in accordance with the following procedures:\n\n(1) The governing body must follow substantially the authorization procedures of section 384.25 to authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract for personal property which is payable from the general fund. The governing body must follow substantially the authorization procedures of section 384.25 to authorize the lease or lease-purchase contract for real property which is payable from the general fund if the principal amount of the lease-purchase contract does not exceed the following limits:\n\n(a) Four hundred thousand dollars in a city having a population of five thousand or less.\n\n(b) Seven hundred thousand dollars in a city having a population of more than five thousand but not more than seventy-five thousand.\n\n(c) One million dollars in a city having a population of more than seventy-five thousand.\n\n(2) The governing body must follow the following procedures to authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract for real property which is payable from the general fund if the principal amount of the lease or lease-purchase contract exceeds the limits set forth in subparagraph (1):\n\n(a) The governing body must institute proceedings to enter into a lease or lease-purchase contract payable from the general fund by causing a notice of the meeting to discuss entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract, including a statement of the principal amount and purpose of the lease or lease-purchase contract and the right to petition for an election, to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least ten days prior to the discussion meeting. No sooner than thirty days following the discussion meeting shall the governing body hold a meeting at which it is proposed to take action to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract.\n\n(b) (i) If at any time before the end of the thirty-day period after which a meeting may be held to take action to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract, a petition is filed with the clerk of the city in the manner provided by section 362.4, asking that the question of entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract be submitted to the registered voters of the city, the governing body shall either by resolution declare the proposal to enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract to have been abandoned or shall direct the county commissioner of elections to call a special election upon the question of entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract. However, for purposes of this subparagraph, the petition shall not require signatures in excess of one thousand persons.\n\n(ii) The question to be placed on the ballot shall be stated affirmatively in substantially the following manner:\n\nShall the city of ................................ enter into a lease or lease-purchase contract in amount of $................ for the purpose of ........................?\n\n(iii) Notice of the election and its conduct shall be in the manner provided in section 384.26, subsections 2 through 4.\n\n(c) If a petition is not filed or if a petition is filed and the proposition of entering into the lease or lease-purchase contract is approved at an election, the governing body may proceed and enter into the lease or lease-purchase contract.\n\nf. The governing body may authorize a lease or lease-purchase contract payable from the net revenues of a city utility, combined utility system, city enterprise, or combined city enterprise by following the authorization procedures of section 384.83.\n\ng. A lease or lease-purchase contract to which a city is a party or in which a city has a participatory interest is an obligation of a political subdivision of this state for the purposes of chapters 502 and 636, and is a lawful investment for banks, trust companies, savings associations, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, executors, guardians, trustees, and any other fiduciaries responsible for the investment of funds.\n\nh. Property that is lease-purchased by a city is exempt under section 427.1, subsection 2.\n\ni. A contract for construction by a private party of property to be lease-purchased by a city is a contract for a public improvement under section 26.2, subsection 3. If the estimated cost of the property to be lease-purchased that is renovated, repaired, or involves new construction exceeds the competitive bid threshold set in section 26.3, the city shall comply with the competitive bidding requirements of section 26.3.\n\n5. Enter into insurance agreements obligating the city to make payments beyond its current budget year to procure or provide for a policy of insurance, a self-insurance program, or a local government risk pool to protect the city against tort liability, loss of property, or any other risk associated with the operation of the city. Such a self-insurance program or local government risk pool is not insurance and is not subject to regulation under chapters 505 through 523C. However, those self-insurance plans regulated pursuant to section 509A.14 shall remain subject to the requirements of section 509A.14 and rules adopted pursuant to that section.\n\n[SS15, §741-d, 741-g; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §5773; C46, §368.41, 368.42; C50, §368.42, 368.56; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, §368.18; C75, 77, 79, 81, §364.4]\n\n85 Acts, ch 156, §3; 86 Acts, ch 1211, §22; 92 Acts, ch 1138, §4; 95 Acts, ch 67, §53; 2006 Acts, ch 1017, §35, 42, 43\n\n; 2006 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §32, 49\n\n; 2009 Acts, ch 100, §12, 21; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §35; 2012 Acts, ch 1017, §75; 2018 Acts, ch 1075, §11 – 13; 2018 Acts, ch 1172, §31, 71, 72\n\nReferred to in §346.27, 384.110",

To authorize recovery of more than a nominal amount, facts must exist and be shown by the evidence which afford a reasonable basis for measuring the amount of the claimant’s actual damages, and the amount of actual damages shall not be determined by speculation, conjecture, or surmise. All legal or equitable defenses are available to the abutting property owner in an action brought pursuant to this paragraph.

Require the removal of diseased trees or dead wood, except as stated in subsection 2, paragraph “c” of this section.\n\nc. Require the removal, repair, or dismantling of a dangerous building or structure.\n\nd. Require the numbering of buildings.\n\ne. Require connection to public drainage systems from abutting property when necessary for public health or safety.\n\nf. Require connection to public sewer systems from abutting property, and require installation of sanitary toilet facilities and removal of other toilet facilities on such property.\n\ng. Require the cutting or destruction of weeds or other growth which constitutes a health, safety, or fire hazard.\n\nh. If the property owner does not perform an action required under this subsection within a reasonable time after notice, a city may perform the required action and assess the costs against the property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.

If, in repairing and replacing improvements in the area between the lot or property lines and the curb lines pursuant to subsection 5, it becomes necessary for the city to repair or replace adjacent improvements in the area, the cost of repairing or replacing the adjacent public improvements may be assessed, with consent of the property owner, against the property which the public improvements abut.\n\n7.

The matter shall be tried before a magistrate, a district associate judge, or a district judge in the same manner as a small claim. The matter shall only be tried before a judge in district court if the total amount of civil penalties assessed exceeds the jurisdictional amount for small claims set forth in section 631.1.\n\nb.

If the person named in the citation is served as provided in this section and fails without good cause to appear in response to the civil citation, judgment shall be entered against the person cited.\n\n8. A person against whom judgment is entered, shall pay court costs and fees as in small claims under chapter 631. If the action is dismissed, the city is liable for the court costs and court fees. Where the action is disposed of without payment, or provision for assessment, of court costs, the clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the city.\n\n9. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this section does not preclude a city from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same action.\n\n10. a. When judgment has been entered against a defendant, the court may do any of the following:\n\n(1) Impose a civil penalty by entry of a personal judgment against the defendant.\n\n(2) Direct that payment of the civil penalty be suspended or deferred under conditions imposed by the court.\n\n(3) Grant appropriate alternative relief ordering the defendant to abate or cease the violation.\n\n(4) Authorize the city to abate or correct the violation.\n\n(5) Order that the city’s costs for abatement or correction of the violation be entered as a personal judgment against the defendant or assessed against the property where the violation occurred, or both.\n\nb. If a defendant willfully violates the terms of an order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.\n\nc. A magistrate or district associate judge shall have jurisdiction to assess or enter judgment for costs of abatement or correction in an amount not to exceed the jurisdictional amount for a money judgment in a civil action pursuant to section 631.1, subsection 1, for magistrates and section 602.6306, subsection 2, for district associate judges. If the city seeks abatement or correction costs in excess of those amounts, and the matter is not before a judge in district court, the case shall be referred to the district court for hearing and entry of an appropriate order. The procedure for hearing in the district court shall be the same procedure as that for a small claims appeal pursuant to section 631.13.\n\n11. The defendant or the city may file a motion for a new trial or may appeal the decision of a magistrate, district associate judge, or a district judge to the district court. The procedure on appeal shall be the same as for a small claim pursuant to section 631.13. A factual determination made by the trial court, supported by substantial evidence as shown in the record, is binding for purposes of appeal relating to the violation at issue, but shall not be admissible or binding as to any future violation for the same or similar ordinance provision by the same defendant.\n\n12. This section does not preclude a peace officer of a city from issuing a criminal citation for a violation of a city code or regulation if criminal penalties are also provided for the violation. Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the defendant, constitutes a separate offense.\n\n13. The issuance of a civil citation for a municipal infraction or the ensuing court proceedings do not provide an action for false arrest, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution.\n\n14. An action brought pursuant to this section for a municipal infraction which is an environmental violation does not preclude, and is in addition to, any other enforcement action which may be brought pursuant to chapter 455B, 455D, 455E, or 459, subchapters II, III, and VI.\n\n15.
