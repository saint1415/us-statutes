The fund shall be separate from the general fund of the state and shall not be considered part of the general fund of the state except in determining the cash position of the state for payment of state obligations. The moneys in the fund are not subject to the provisions of section 8.33 and shall not be transferred, used, obligated, appropriated, or otherwise encumbered except as provided in this chapter. Moneys in the fund may be used for cash flow purposes, provided that any moneys so allocated are returned to the fund by the end of each fiscal year. However, the fund shall be considered a special account for the purposes of section 8.53, relating to elimination of any GAAP deficit. For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, “property tax relief fund” means the property tax relief fund created in this section.\n\n2. Moneys shall be distributed from the property tax relief fund to the mental health and disability services regional service system for mental health and disability services, in accordance with the appropriations made to the fund and other statutory requirements.\n\n95 Acts, ch 206, §17; 96 Acts, ch 1034, §38; 96 Acts, ch 1219, §104; 97 Acts, ch 158, §28; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §167; 2003 Acts, ch 108, §72; 2010 Acts, ch 1193, §14; 2012 Acts, ch 1120, §134, 139, 140; 2017 Acts, ch 109, §12, 20, 21; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §102, 108; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1149\n\nReferred to in §437A.8, 437A.15\n\nSection amended",
