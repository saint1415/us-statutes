      "text": "437A.4 Replacement tax imposed on delivery of electricity.\n\n1. A replacement delivery tax is imposed on every person who makes a delivery of electricity to a consumer within this state. The replacement delivery tax imposed by this section is equal to the sum of the following:\n\na. The number of kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to consumers by the taxpayer within each electric competitive service area during the tax year multiplied by the electric replacement delivery tax rate in effect for each such electric competitive service area.\n\nb. Where applicable, and in addition to the tax imposed by paragraph “a”, the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to consumers by the taxpayer within each electric competitive service area during the tax year multiplied by the electric transfer replacement tax rate for each such electric competitive service area.\n\n2. If electricity is consumed in this state, whether such electricity is purchased, transferred, or self-generated, and the delivery, purchase, transference, or self-generation of such electricity is not subject to the tax imposed under subsection 1, a tax is imposed on the consumer at the rates prescribed under subsection 1.\n\n3. Electric replacement delivery tax rates shall be calculated by the director for each electric competitive service area as follows:\n\na. The director shall determine the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to electric service of each taxpayer, other than a municipal utility, principally serving an electric competitive service area and of each generation and transmission electric cooperative for the assessment years 1993 through 1997 based on property tax payments made. In the case of a municipal utility, the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to electric service is the centrally assessed property tax liability of such municipal utility allocated to electric service for the 1997 assessment year based on property tax payments made.\n\nb. The director shall determine, for each taxpayer, the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity generated which would have been subject to taxation under section 437A.6, the number of pole miles which would have been subject to taxation under section 437A.7, and the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to consumers which would have been subject to taxation under this section in calendar year 1998, had such sections been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\nc. The director shall determine the electric generation, transmission, and delivery tax components of the average centrally assessed property tax liability determined in paragraph “a” for each electric competitive service area as follows:\n\n(1) The electric generation tax component for an electric competitive service area shall be computed by multiplying the tax rate set forth in section 437A.6 by the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity generated by the taxpayer principally serving such electric competitive service area which would have been subject to taxation under section 437A.6 in calendar year 1998, had that section been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\n(2) The electric transmission tax component for an electric competitive service area shall be computed by multiplying the tax rates set forth in section 437A.7 by the number of pole miles for each line voltage owned or leased by the taxpayer principally serving such electric competitive service area which would have been subject to taxation under section 437A.7 on December 31, 1998, had that section been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\n(3) The electric delivery tax component for an electric competitive service area shall be the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to electric service of the taxpayer principally serving such electric competitive service area less the electric generation and transmission tax components computed for such electric competitive service area.\n\n(4) The electric delivery tax component for each electric competitive service area shall be adjusted, as necessary, to assign the excess property tax liability of each generation and transmission electric cooperative to the electric competitive service areas principally served on January 1, 1999, by its distribution electric cooperative members and by those municipal utilities which were purchasing members of a municipal electric cooperative association that is a member of the generation and transmission electric cooperative. Such assignment of excess property tax liability of each such generation and transmission electric cooperative shall be made in proportion to the appropriate wholesale rate charges in calendar year 1998 to its distribution electric cooperative members and municipal electric cooperative association members which purchased electricity from the generation and transmission electric cooperative. Any amount assignable to a municipal electric cooperative association shall be reassigned to the electric competitive service areas served by such association’s purchasing municipal utility members and shall be allocated among them in proportion to the appropriate wholesale rate charges in calendar year 1998 by such municipal electric cooperative association to its purchasing municipal utility members. For purposes of this subsection, “excess property tax liability” means the amount by which the average centrally assessed property tax liability for the assessment years 1993 through 1997 of a generation and transmission electric cooperative exceeds the tentative generation and transmission taxes which would have been imposed on such generation and transmission electric cooperative under sections 437A.6 and 437A.7 for calendar year 1998, had such taxes been in effect for calendar year 1998. An electric cooperative described in section 437A.7, subsection 3, paragraph “c”, is deemed not to have any excess property tax liability.\n\nd. The director shall determine an electric delivery tax rate for each electric competitive service area by dividing the electric delivery tax component for the electric competitive service area, as adjusted by paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4), by the number of kilowatt-hours delivered by the taxpayer principally serving the electric competitive service area to consumers in calendar year 1998, which would have been subject to taxation under this section if this section had been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\n4. Municipal electric transfer replacement tax rates shall be calculated annually by the city council of each city located within an electric competitive service area served by a municipal utility as of January 1, 1999, by dividing the average annual dollar amount of electric-related transfers made pursuant to section 384.89 by the municipal utility serving the electric competitive service area, other than those transfers declared exempt from the transfer replacement tax by the city council, plus the municipal transfer replacement tax received by the municipality, if any, during the five immediately preceding calendar years by the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to consumers in the electric competitive service area during the immediately preceding calendar year which were subject to taxation under this section or which would have been subject to taxation under this section had it been in effect for such calendar year. The city council on its own motion, or in the case of a municipal utility governed by a board of trustees under chapter 388 upon a resolution of the board of trustees requesting such action, may declare any transfer or part of such transfer to be exempt from the transfer replacement tax under this section. Such rates shall be calculated and reported to the director on or before August 31 of each tax year.\n\n5. A municipal utility taxpayer is entitled to a credit against the municipal electric transfer replacement tax equal to the average amount of electric-related transfers made by such municipal utility taxpayer under section 384.89, other than those transfers declared exempt from transfer replacement tax by the city council, during the preceding five calendar years.\n\n6. The following are not subject to the replacement delivery tax imposed by subsections 1 and 2:\n\na. Delivery of electricity generated by a low capacity factor electric power generating plant.\n\nb. Delivery of electricity to a city from such city’s municipal utility, provided such electricity is used by the city for the public purposes of the city.\n\nc. Electricity consumed by a state university or university of science and technology, provided such electricity was generated by property described in section 427.1, subsection 1.\n\nd. Electricity generated and consumed by a self-generator.\n\n7. Notwithstanding subsection 1, the electric delivery tax rate applied to kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered by a taxpayer to utility property and facilities which are placed in service on or after January 1, 1999, and are owned by or leased to and initially served by such taxpayer shall be the electric delivery tax rate in effect for the electric competitive service area principally served by such utility property and facilities even though such utility property and facilities may be physically located in another electric competitive service area.\n\n8. a. If for any tax year after calendar year 1998, the total taxable kilowatt-hours of electricity required to be reported by taxpayers pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”, with respect to any electric competitive service area, increases or decreases by more than the threshold percentage from the average of the base year amounts for that electric competitive service area during the immediately preceding five calendar years, the tax rate imposed under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2, for that tax year shall be recalculated by the director for that electric competitive service area so that the total of the replacement electric delivery taxes required to be reported pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, for that electric competitive service area with respect to the tax imposed under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2, shall be as follows:\n\n(1) If the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity required to be reported increased by more than the threshold percentage, one hundred two percent of such taxes required to be reported by taxpayers for that electric competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\n(2) If the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity required to be reported decreased by more than the threshold percentage, ninety-eight percent of such taxes required to be reported by taxpayers for that electric competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\nb. For purposes of paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) and (2), in computing the tax rate under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2, for tax year 1999, the director shall use the electric delivery tax component computed for the electric competitive service area pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “c”, in lieu of the taxes required to be reported for that electric competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\nc. The threshold percentage shall be determined annually and shall be eight percent for any electric competitive service area in which the average of the base year amounts for the preceding five calendar years does not exceed three billion kilowatt-hours, and ten percent for all other electric competitive service areas.\n\nd. Any such recalculation of an electric delivery tax rate, if required, shall be made and the new rate shall be published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director by no later than May 31 following the tax year. The director shall adjust the tentative replacement tax imposed by subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2 required to be shown on any affected taxpayer’s return pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, to reflect the adjusted delivery tax rate for the tax year, and report such adjustment to the affected taxpayer on or before June 30 following the tax year. The new electric delivery tax rate shall apply prospectively, until such time as further adjustment is required.\n\ne. For purposes of this section, “base year amount” means for calendar years prior to tax year 1999, the sum of the kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to consumers within an electric competitive service area by the taxpayer principally serving such electric competitive service area which would have been subject to taxation under this section had this section been in effect for those years; and for tax years after calendar year 1998, the taxable kilowatt-hours of electricity required to be reported by taxpayers pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”, with respect to any electric competitive service area.\n\n9. a. After calendar year 1998, if a municipal electric cooperative association ceases to purchase electricity from the generation and transmission electric cooperative from which it purchased electricity in 1998, and for a period of one hundred eighty days after such purchases cease, no municipal utility member of such association purchases electricity from such generation and transmission electric cooperative, the excess property tax liability assigned pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4), to the electric competitive service areas principally served by the municipal utility members on January 1, 1999, shall be removed from the electric delivery tax component of those electric competitive service areas and the electric delivery tax rate for those electric competitive service areas shall be recalculated to reflect that change.\n\nb. After calendar year 1998, if a municipal utility ceases to be a purchasing member of a municipal electric cooperative association which purchased electricity in calendar year 1998 from a generation and transmission electric cooperative, and for a period of one hundred eighty days after the municipal utility ceases to be a purchasing member of such association such municipal utility does not purchase electricity from such generation and transmission electric cooperative, the excess property tax liability assigned pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4), to the electric competitive service area principally served by the municipal utility on January 1, 1999, shall be removed from the electric delivery tax component of those electric competitive service areas and the electric delivery tax rate for those electric competitive service areas shall be recalculated to reflect that change.\n\nc. If a recalculation has previously been made by the director pursuant to subsection 8 for an electric competitive service area described in this subsection, the recalculation required by this subsection shall be made by the director by modifying the most recent recalculation under subsection 8 to eliminate the excess property tax liability originally allocated to such electric competitive service area under subsection 3, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4).\n\nd. Any recalculation required by this subsection shall be made and the new rate shall be published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director by May 31 of the calendar year during which the events described in paragraphs “a” and “b” are reported as provided in section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraph “f”. The new electric delivery tax rate shall be effective January 1 of the tax year in which it is published and shall apply prospectively, until such time as further adjustment is required.\n\n10. The electric delivery tax rate in effect for each electric competitive service area shall be published by the director in the Iowa administrative bulletin on or before November 30, 1999, and annually after that date, during the last quarter of the tax year.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1194, §5, 40; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §92\n\nReferred to in §437A.3, 437A.8, 437A.15, 437A.17A",

      "text": "437A.5 Replacement tax imposed on delivery of natural gas.\n\n1. A replacement delivery tax is imposed on every person who makes a delivery of natural gas to a consumer within this state. The replacement delivery tax imposed by this section shall be equal to the sum of the following:\n\na. The number of therms of natural gas delivered to consumers by the taxpayer within each natural gas competitive service area during the tax year multiplied by the natural gas delivery tax rate in effect for each such natural gas competitive service area.\n\nb. Where applicable, and in addition to the tax imposed by paragraph “a”, the number of therms of natural gas delivered to consumers by the taxpayer within each natural gas competitive service area during the tax year multiplied by the municipal natural gas transfer replacement tax rate for each such natural gas competitive service area.\n\nc. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs “a” and “b”, a natural gas delivery rate of one and eleven-hundredths of a cent (.0111) per therm of natural gas is imposed on all natural gas delivered to or consumed by a new electric power generating plant for purposes of generating electricity within the state during the tax year. However, if a new electric power generating plant is exempt from a replacement generation tax pursuant to section 437A.6, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, the natural gas delivery rate for the municipal service area that the new plant serves shall instead apply for deliveries of natural gas by the municipal gas utility.\n\n(2) The provisions of subsection 8 shall not apply to the therms of natural gas subject to the delivery tax set forth in this paragraph.\n\n(3) If the new electric power generating plant is part of a cogeneration facility or new cogeneration facility, the natural gas delivery rate for that plant shall be the lesser of the natural gas delivery rate established in this paragraph “c” or the rate per therm of natural gas as in effect at the time of the initial natural gas deliveries to the plant for the natural gas competitive service area where the new electric power generating plant is located.\n\n2. If natural gas is consumed in this state, whether such natural gas is purchased or transferred, and the delivery, purchase, or transference of such natural gas is not subject to the tax imposed under subsection 1, a tax is imposed on the consumer at the rates prescribed under subsection 1.\n\n3. Natural gas delivery tax rates shall be calculated by the director for each natural gas competitive service area as follows:\n\na. The director shall determine the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to natural gas service of each taxpayer, other than a municipal utility, principally serving a natural gas competitive service area for the assessment years 1993 through 1997 based on property tax payments made. In the case of a municipal utility, the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to natural gas service is the centrally assessed property tax liability of such municipal utility allocated to natural gas service for the 1997 assessment year based on property tax payments made. For purposes of this subsection, taxpayer does not include a pipeline company defined in section 479A.2.\n\nb. The director shall determine for each taxpayer the number of therms of natural gas delivered to consumers which would have been subject to taxation under this section in calendar year 1998 had this section been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\nc. The director shall determine a natural gas delivery tax rate for each natural gas competitive service area by dividing the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to natural gas service of the taxpayer principally serving the natural gas competitive service area by the number of therms of natural gas delivered by such taxpayer to consumers in calendar year 1998 which would have been subject to taxation under this section had such section been in effect for calendar year 1998.\n\n4. Municipal natural gas transfer replacement tax rates shall be calculated annually by the city council of each city located within a natural gas competitive service area served by a municipal utility as of January 1, 1999, by dividing the average annual dollar amount of natural gas-related transfers made pursuant to section 384.89 by the municipal utility serving the natural gas competitive service area, other than those transfers declared exempt from the transfer replacement tax by the city council, plus the municipal transfer replacement tax received by the municipality, if any, during the five immediately preceding calendar years, by the number of therms of natural gas delivered to consumers in the natural gas competitive service area during the immediately preceding calendar year which were subject to taxation under this section or which would have been subject to taxation under this section had it been in effect for such calendar year. The city council on its own motion, or in the case of a municipal utility governed by a board of trustees under chapter 388 upon a resolution of the board of trustees requesting such action, may declare any transfer or part of such transfer to be exempt from the transfer replacement tax under this section. Such rates shall be calculated and reported to the director on or before August 31 of each tax year.\n\n5. A municipal utility taxpayer is entitled to a credit against the municipal natural gas transfer replacement tax equal to the average amount of natural gas-related transfers made by such municipal utility taxpayer under section 384.89, other than those transfers declared exempt from transfer replacement tax by the city council, during the preceding five calendar years.\n\n6. a. Notwithstanding subsection 1, the natural gas delivery tax rate applied to therms of natural gas delivered by a taxpayer to utility property and facilities that are placed in service on or after January 1, 1999, and that are owned by or leased to and initially served by such taxpayer shall be the natural gas delivery tax rate in effect for the natural gas competitive service area principally served by such utility property and facilities even though such utility property and facilities may be physically located in another natural gas competitive service area.\n\nb. This subsection shall not apply to natural gas delivered to or consumed by new electric power generating plants.\n\n7. a. Delivery of natural gas to a city from such city’s municipal utility is not subject to the replacement delivery tax imposed under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2, provided such natural gas is used by the city for the public purposes of the city.\n\nb. Subsection 2 does not apply to natural gas consumed by a person, other than an electric company, natural gas company, electric cooperative, or municipal utility, acquired by means of facilities owned by or leased to such person on January 1, 1999, which were physically attached to pipelines that are not permitted pursuant to chapter 479 and used by such person for the purpose of bypassing the local natural gas company or municipal utility.\n\nc. Subsection 1 does not apply to natural gas which is delivered, by a pipeline that is not permitted pursuant to chapter 479, into a facility owned by or leased to a person, other than an electric company, natural gas company, electric cooperative, or municipal utility, if the person who consumes the gas uses the gas for the purpose of bypassing the local natural gas company or municipal utility, regardless of whether such facility existed on January 1, 1999.\n\n8. If, for any tax year after calendar year 1998, the total taxable therms of natural gas required to be reported by taxpayers pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”, with respect to any natural gas competitive service area increases or decreases by more than the threshold percentage from the average of the base year amounts for that natural gas competitive service area during the immediately preceding five calendar years, the tax rate imposed under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2 for that tax year shall be recalculated by the director for that natural gas competitive service area so that the total of the replacement natural gas delivery taxes required to be reported pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, for that natural gas competitive service area with respect to the tax imposed under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2 shall be as follows:\n\na. If the number of therms of natural gas required to be reported increased by more than the threshold percentage, one hundred two percent of such taxes required to be reported by taxpayers for that natural gas competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\nb. If the number of therms of natural gas required to be reported decreased by more than the threshold percentage, ninety-eight percent of such taxes required to be reported by taxpayers for that natural gas competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\nc. (1) For purposes of paragraphs “a” and “b”, in computing the tax rate under subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2 for calendar year 1999, the director shall use the average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to natural gas service computed for the natural gas competitive service area pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “a”, in lieu of the taxes required to be reported for that natural gas competitive service area for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\n(2) The threshold percentage shall be determined annually and shall be eight percent for any natural gas competitive service area in which the average of the base year amounts for the preceding five calendar years does not exceed two hundred fifty million therms, and ten percent for all other natural gas competitive service areas.\n\n(3) Recalculation of a natural gas delivery tax rate, if required, shall be made and the new rate published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director by no later than May 31 following the tax year. The director shall adjust the tentative replacement tax imposed by subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and subsection 2 required to be shown on any affected taxpayer’s return pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, to reflect the adjusted delivery tax rate for the tax year, and report such adjustment to the affected taxpayer on or before June 30 following the tax year. The new natural gas delivery tax rate shall apply prospectively, until such time as further adjustment is required.\n\n(4) For purposes of this subsection, “base year amount” means for calendar years prior to tax year 1999, the sum of the therms of natural gas delivered to consumers within a natural gas competitive service area by the taxpayer principally serving such natural gas competitive service area which would have been subject to taxation under this section had this section been in effect for those years; and for tax years after calendar year 1998, the taxable therms of natural gas required to be reported by taxpayers pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”, with respect to any natural gas competitive service area.\n\n9.

The generation and transmission electric cooperative shall remit the amount determined by the director to the appropriate county treasurer by September 30. If the generation and transmission electric cooperative timely notifies the director and timely remits to the county treasurer the amounts of replacement tax, as determined by the director, the generation and transmission electric cooperative shall not be liable for that unpaid replacement tax due from the distribution electric cooperative member or municipal utility purchasing member. The generation and transmission electric cooperative shall also not be liable for a special utility property tax levy, if any, and shall not be entitled to a tax credit, if any, attributable to the unpaid replacement tax.

If a generation and transmission electric cooperative, after notice, does not timely pay the correct amount of replacement tax or special utility property tax levy attributable to the excess property tax liability to the appropriate county treasurer, after receiving the required payment from the distribution electric cooperative member or municipal utility purchasing member, such replacement tax shall be enforced solely against the generation and transmission electric cooperative under sections 437A.9 through 437A.13, and shall not be enforced against the paying distribution electric cooperative member or municipal utility purchasing member, and the special utility property tax levy shall be enforced solely against the generation and transmission electric cooperative.\n\nd. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, a taxpayer who owns or leases a new electric power generating plant and who has no other operating property in the state of Iowa except for operating property directly serving the new electric power generating plant as described in section 437A.16 shall pay the replacement generation tax associated with the allocation of the local amount to the county treasurer of the county in which the local amount is located and shall remit the remaining replacement generation tax, if any, to the director according to paragraph “a” for remittance of the tax to county treasurers.

At the time of filing the return required by subsection 2, the taxpayer shall calculate the municipal transfer replacement tax due for the tax year. Municipal transfer replacement taxes shall be paid to the chief financial officer of the city to which the taxes are allocated at such time and place as directed by the city council.\n\n6. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 5, a taxpayer shall not be required to file a return otherwise required by this section or remit any replacement tax for any tax year in which the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability before credits is three hundred dollars or less, provided that all electric companies, electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, and natural gas companies shall file a return, regardless of the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability.\n\n7. Following the determination of electric and natural gas delivery tax rates by the director pursuant to section 437A.4, subsection 3, and section 437A.5, subsection 3, if an adjustment resulting from a taxpayer appeal is made to taxes levied and paid by a taxpayer with respect to any of the assessment years 1993 through 1997 used in determining such rates, the director shall recalculate the delivery tax rate for any affected electric or natural gas competitive service area to reflect the impact of such adjustment as if such adjustment had been reflected in the initial determination of average centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to electric or natural gas service pursuant to section 437A.4, subsection 3, paragraph “a”, and section 437A.5, subsection 3, paragraph “a”. Rate recalculations shall be made and published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director on or before March 31 following the calendar year in which a final determination of the adjustment is made. Taxpayers shall report to the director any increase or decrease in the tentative replacement tax required to be shown to be due pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph “e”, for any tax year with the return for the year in which the recalculated tax rates which gave rise to the adjustment are published in the Iowa administrative bulletin. The director and the department of management shall redetermine the allocation of replacement taxes pursuant to section 437A.15 for each affected tax year. If a taxpayer has overpaid replacement taxes, the overpayment shall be reported by the director to such taxpayer and to the appropriate county treasurers and shall be a credit against the replacement taxes owed by such taxpayer for the year in which the recalculated rates which gave rise to the overpayment are published in the Iowa administrative bulletin. If a taxpayer has overpaid centrally assessed property taxes for assessment years prior to tax year 1999, such overpayment shall be a credit against replacement taxes owed by such taxpayer for the year in which the overpayment is determined. Unused credits may be carried forward and used to reduce future replacement tax liabilities until exhausted.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1194, §9, 40; 2000 Acts, ch 1114, §7, 17, 18; 2001 Acts, ch 145, §5 – 8, 13; 2003 Acts, ch 106, §10, 15; 2010 Acts, ch 1161, §5, 11\n\nReferred to in §437A.4, 437A.5, 437A.9, 437A.14, 437A.15, 437A.16, 437A.16A, 437A.17B, 437A.24",

The general allocation formula for a tax year shall allocate to each local taxing district that portion of the replacement taxes owed by each taxpayer which bears the same ratio as such taxpayer’s general property tax equivalents for each local taxing district bears to such taxpayer’s total general property tax equivalents for all local taxing districts in Iowa.\n\n(2) When allocating natural gas delivery taxes on deliveries of natural gas to a new electric power generating plant, ten percent of those natural gas delivery taxes shall be allocated over new gas property built to directly serve the new electric power generating plant and ninety percent of those natural gas delivery taxes shall be allocated to the general property tax equivalents of all gas property within the natural gas competitive service area or areas where the new gas property is located.\n\nb. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, if excess property tax liability has been assigned pursuant to section 437A.4, subsection 3, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4), and has not been removed, the allocation of electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability shall be made by the director and the department of management so as to allocate the electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability among those local taxing districts in which the property associated with the excess property tax liability is located. In order to ensure that the electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability is paid to the appropriate county treasurer for disposition to the local taxing districts, each distribution electric cooperative member and each municipal utility purchasing member subject to section 437A.4, subsection 3, paragraph “c”, subparagraph (4), shall pay to the appropriate generation and transmission electric cooperative the electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability by September 10. The amount of electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability shall equal that percentage of total electric delivery replacement tax liability that the excess property tax liability bears to the total property tax liability contained in the electric delivery tax component. The generation and transmission electric cooperative shall pay the electric delivery replacement tax attributable to the excess property tax liability to the appropriate county treasurer.\n\nc. If paragraph “b” is applicable, on or before August 1, the director shall notify each distribution electric cooperative member, each municipal utility purchasing member, and each generation and transmission electric cooperative of the amount of electric delivery replacement tax to be paid to the generation and transmission electric cooperative. On or before August 1, the director shall notify the generation and transmission electric cooperative of the amount of replacement tax liability attributable to the excess property tax liability that is payable to each county treasurer. The director shall determine the amount of any special utility property tax levy or tax credit attributable to the excess property tax liability which shall be reflected in the amount required to be paid by each distribution electric cooperative member and each municipal utility purchasing member to the generation and transmission electric cooperative.\n\nd. If, during the tax year, a taxpayer transferred operating property or an interest in operating property to another taxpayer, the transferee taxpayer’s replacement tax associated with that property shall be allocated, for the tax year in which the transfer occurred, under this section in accordance with the general allocation formula on the basis of the general property tax equivalents of the transferor taxpayer.\n\ne. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if during the tax year a person who was not a taxpayer during the prior tax year acquires a new major addition, as defined in section 437A.3, subsection 18, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4), the replacement tax associated with that major addition shall be allocated, for that tax year, under this section in accordance with the general allocating formula on the basis of the general property tax equivalents established under paragraph “a” of this subsection, except that the levy rates established and reported to the department of management on or before June 30 following the tax year in which the major addition was acquired shall be applied to the prorated assessed value of the major addition. For purposes of this paragraph, “prorated assessed value of the major addition” means the assessed value of the major addition as of January 1 of the year following the tax year in which the major addition was acquired multiplied by the percentage derived by dividing the number of months that the major addition existed during the tax year by twelve, counting any portion of a month as a full month.\n\nf. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if a taxpayer is a municipal utility or a municipal owner of an electric power facility financed under the provisions of chapter 28F or 476A, the assessed value, other than the local amount, of a new electric power generating plant shall be allocated to each taxing district in which the municipal utility or municipal owner is serving customers and has electric meters in operation in the ratio that the number of operating electric meters of the municipal utility or municipal owner located in the taxing district bears to the total number of operating electric meters of the municipal utility or municipal owner in the state as of January 1 of the tax year. If the municipal utility or municipal owner of an electric power facility financed under the provisions of chapter 28F or 476A has a new electric power generating plant but the municipal utility or municipal owner has no operating electric meters in this state, the municipal utility or municipal owner shall pay the replacement generation tax associated with the new electric power generating plant allocation of the local amount to the county treasurer of the county in which the local amount is located and shall remit the remaining replacement generation tax, if any, to the director at the times contained in section 437A.8, subsection 4, for remittance of the tax to the county treasurers. All remaining replacement generation tax revenues received by the director shall be deposited in the property tax relief fund created in section 426B.1, and shall be distributed as provided in section 426B.2.\n\n4. a. On or before August 31 following tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001, each county treasurer shall compute a special utility property tax levy or tax credit for each taxpayer for which a replacement tax liability for each such tax year is reported to the county treasurer pursuant to subsection 1, and shall notify the taxpayer of the amount of such tax levy or tax credit. The amount of the special utility property tax levy or credit shall be determined for each taxpayer by the county treasurer by comparing the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county pursuant to this section with the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county is less than the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, the county treasurer shall levy a special utility property tax equal to the shortfall which shall be added to and collected with the replacement tax owed by the taxpayer to the county treasurer for the tax year pursuant to section 437A.8, subsection 4. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county exceeds the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, the county treasurer shall issue a credit to the taxpayer which shall be applied to reduce the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability to the county treasurer for the tax year. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county equals the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, no levy or credit is required. Replacement tax liability for purposes of this subsection means replacement tax liability before credits allowed by section 437A.8, subsection 7. A recalculation of a special utility property tax levy or credit shall not be made as a result of a subsequent recalculation of replacement tax liability under section 437A.8, subsection 7, or adjustment to assessed value under section 437A.19, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (6). “Anticipated tax revenues from a taxpayer” means the product of the total levy rates imposed by the taxing districts and the value of taxpayer property allocated to the taxing districts and reported to the county auditor. Special utility property tax levies and credits shall be treated as replacement taxes for purposes of section 437A.11. If a special utility property tax levy payment becomes delinquent, the delinquent payment shall accrue interest and penalty in the same manner and amount as the replacement tax under section 437A.13.\n\nb. It is the intent of the general assembly that the general assembly evaluate the impact of the imposition of the replacement tax for purposes of determining whether this subsection shall remain in effect and whether a determination shall be made as to the necessity of a recalculation as provided in this subsection for tax years beginning after tax year 2000.\n\n5. The replacement tax, as adjusted by any special utility property tax levy or credit and remitted to a county treasurer by each taxpayer, shall be treated as a property tax when received and shall be disposed of by the county treasurer as taxes on real estate. Notwithstanding the allocation provisions of this section, nothing in this section shall deny any affected taxing entity, as defined in section 403.17, subsection 1, which has enacted an ordinance or entered into an agreement for the division and allocation of taxes authorized under section 403.19 and under which ordinance or agreement the taxes collected in respect of properties owned by any of the taxpayers remitting replacement taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter are being divided and allocated, the right to receive its share of the replacement tax revenues collected for any year which would otherwise be paid to such affected taxing entity under the terms of any such ordinance or agreement had this chapter not been enacted. To the extent that adjustment must be made to the allocation described in this section to give effect to the terms of such ordinances or agreements, the department of management and the county treasurer shall make such adjustments.\n\n6. In lieu of the adjustment provided for in subsection 5, the assessed value of property described in section 403.19, subsection 1, may be reduced by the city or county by the amount of the taxable value of the property described in section 437A.16 included in such area on January 1, 1997, pursuant to amendment of the ordinance adopted by such city or county pursuant to section 403.19.\n\n7. a. The department of management, in consultation with the department of revenue, shall coordinate the utility replacement tax task force and provide staffing assistance to the task force. It is the intent of the general assembly that the task force include representatives of the department of management, department of revenue, electric companies, natural gas companies, municipal utilities, electric cooperatives, counties, cities, school boards, and industrial, commercial, and residential consumers, and other appropriate stakeholders. The director of the department of management and the director of revenue shall serve as co-chairpersons of the task force.\n\nb. The task force shall study the effects of the replacement taxes under this chapter and chapter 437B on local taxing authorities, local taxing districts, consumers, and taxpayers through January 1, 2024. If the task force recommends modifications to the replacement tax that will further the purposes of tax neutrality for local taxing authorities, local taxing districts, taxpayers, and consumers, consistent with the stated purposes of this chapter, the department of management shall transmit those recommendations to the general assembly.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1194, §16, 40; 99 Acts, ch 152, §28, 40; 2000 Acts, ch 1114, §10, 11, 17, 18; 2001 Acts, ch 145, §9; 2002 Acts, ch 1050, §37; 2003 Acts, ch 106, §11 – 13, 15; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1096, §2, 4; 2005 Acts, ch 25, §1; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §113; 2007 Acts, ch 150, §2; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §149, 150; 2010 Acts, ch 1161, §6, 11; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2013 Acts, ch 94, §9, 35, 36; 2016 Acts, ch 1128, §8, 16, 19; 2019 Acts, ch 152, §64\n\nReferred to in §437A.7, 437A.8, 437A.14, 437B.11",

Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, the property of a new cogeneration facility subject to replacement tax that is primarily and directly used in the production, generation, transmission, or delivery of electricity shall be exempt from taxation by means of applying a credit, as computed in this section, representing the value of this exempt property against the assessed value of the entire new cogeneration facility as determined by the local assessor under the provisions of chapters 427, 427A, 427B, 428, 441, and any other applicable abatement and exemption provisions under this Code.\n\nb. Following the March 31 due date for the replacement tax return as required by section 437A.8, the director shall annually determine the assessed value of the new cogeneration facility exempt property by dividing the prior year’s replacement tax liability attributable to that facility by the current fiscal year’s consolidated taxing district rate for the taxing district where the facility is located, then multiplying the quotient by one thousand. The director shall certify this value to the local assessor on or before April 10 of the current calendar year. The assessor shall apply this certified value as a credit against the total assessed value of the facility. The allowable credit shall not exceed the total value of the new cogeneration facility as determined by the local assessor for the assessment year and any excess credits shall not be applied to any other assessment year.\n\nc. A credit shall not be applied to a new cogeneration facility for the first year the facility becomes subject to the replacement tax if it first became subject to the replacement tax after January 1 of that year. For the first year in which the new cogeneration facility is subject to the replacement tax as of January 1 of that year, the taxpayer shall estimate the total replacement taxes due for that year and report that estimate to the director by March 31, and the director shall base the determination of assessed value from that estimate. If the estimate varies by more than five percent from the actual replacement tax liability for the year in which the facility was first subject to the replacement tax as of January 1, the director shall adjust the next year’s assessed value calculation by increasing or decreasing the current replacement tax calculation to reflect the difference between the estimate and the actual replacement tax owed for the year in which the facility was first subject to replacement tax as of January 1.\n\n2.

If a taxpayer owns or leases pursuant to a capital lease less than the entire interest in a major addition, the local amount and statewide amount, if any, of such major addition shall be apportioned to the taxpayer on the basis of its percentage interest in such major addition.\n\n2. a. Beginning January 1, 1999, the assessed value of taxpayer property shall be adjusted annually as provided in this section. The director, with respect to each taxpayer, shall do all of the following:\n\n(1) Adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by the change in book value during the preceding calendar year of the local amount of any major addition reported within such local taxing district.\n\n(2) Adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by allocating the change in book value during the preceding calendar year of the statewide amount and all other taxpayer property described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (5), to the assessed value of all taxpayer property in the state pro rata according to its preadjustment value. Any value for a taxpayer owning, or owning an interest in, a new electric power generating plant in excess of a local amount, where such taxpayer owns no other taxpayer property in this state, shall not be allocated to any local taxing districts.\n\n(3) In the case of taxpayer property described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (3), (4), and (7), decrease the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by the assessed value reported within such local taxing district.\n\n(4) In the event of a merger or consolidation of two or more taxpayers, to determine the assessed value of the surviving taxpayer, combine the assessed values of such taxpayers immediately prior to the merger or consolidation.\n\n(5) In the event any taxpayer property is eligible for the urban revitalization tax exemption described in chapter 404, adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property within each affected local taxing district to reflect such exemption.\n\n(6) In the event the base year assessed value of taxpayer property is adjusted as a result of taxpayer appeals, reduce the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district to reflect such adjustment. The adjustment shall be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the taxpayer’s assessed value among the local taxing districts determined without regard to this adjustment. An adjustment to the base year assessed value of taxpayer property shall be made as of January 1 of the year following the date on which the adjustment is finally determined.\n\nb. In no event shall the adjustments set forth in this subsection reduce the assessed value of taxpayer property in any local taxing district below zero.\n\nc. The director, on or before October 31 of each assessment year, shall report to the department of management and to the auditor of each county the adjusted assessed value of taxpayer property as of January 1 of such assessment year for each local taxing district. For purposes of this subsection, the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district subject to adjustment under this section by the director means the assessed value of such property as of the preceding January 1 as determined and allocated among the local taxing districts by the director.\n\nd. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to authorize local taxing authorities to exclude from the calculation of levy rates the taxable value of taxpayer property reported to county auditors pursuant to this subsection.\n\ne. In addition to reporting the assessed values as described in this subsection, the director, on or before October 31 of each assessment year, shall also report to the department of management and to the auditor of each county the taxable value of taxpayer property as of January 1 of such assessment year for each local taxing district. For purposes of this chapter, “taxable value” means the value for all property subject to the replacement tax annually determined by the director, by dividing the estimated annual replacement tax liability for that property by the current fiscal year’s consolidated taxing district rate for the taxing district where that property is located, then multiplying the quotient by one thousand. A taxpayer who paid more than five hundred thousand dollars in replacement tax in the previous tax year or who believes the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability will vary more than ten percent from the previous tax year shall report to the director by October 1 of the current calendar year, on forms prescribed by the director, the estimated replacement tax liability that will be attributable to all of the taxpayer’s property subject to replacement tax for the current tax year. The department shall utilize the estimated replacement tax liability as reported by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s prior year’s replacement tax amounts to estimate the current tax year’s taxable value for that property. Furthermore, a taxpayer who has a new major addition of operating property which is put into service for the first time in the current calendar year shall report to the director by October 1 of the current calendar year, or at the time the major addition is put into service, whichever time is later, on forms prescribed by the director, the cost of the major addition and, if not previously reported, shall report the estimated replacement taxes which that asset will generate in the current calendar year. For the purposes of computing the taxable value of property in a taxing district, the taxing district’s share of the estimated replacement tax liability shall be the taxing district’s percentage share of the “assessed value allocated by property tax equivalent” multiplied by the total estimated replacement tax. “Assessed value allocated by property tax equivalent” shall be determined by dividing the taxpayer’s current year assessed valuation in a taxing district by one thousand, and then multiplying by the prior year’s consolidated tax rate.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1194, §20, 40; 99 Acts, ch 152, §31, 40; 2000 Acts, ch 1114, §12, 18; 2001 Acts, ch 145, §10; 2003 Acts, ch 106, §14, 15; 2004 Acts, ch 1096, §3, 4; 2007 Acts, ch 150, §3, 4; 2009 Acts, ch 60, §14; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §151; 2010 Acts, ch 1161, §9 – 11\n\nReferred to in §437A.3, 437A.15",
