A tax is imposed upon every resident and nonresident of the state which tax shall be levied, collected, and paid annually upon and with respect to the entire taxable income as defined in this subchapter at rates as provided in section 422.5A.\n\nb. (1) The tax imposed upon the taxable income of a nonresident shall be computed by reducing the amount determined pursuant to paragraph “a” by the amounts of nonrefundable credits under this subchapter and by multiplying this resulting amount by a fraction of which the nonresident’s net income allocated to Iowa, as determined in section 422.8, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, is the numerator and the nonresident’s total net income computed under section 422.7 is the denominator. This subparagraph also applies to individuals who are residents of Iowa for less than the entire tax year.\n\n(2) (a) The tax imposed upon the taxable income of a resident shareholder in an S corporation or of an estate or trust with a situs in Iowa that is a shareholder in an S corporation, which S corporation has in effect for the tax year an election under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code and carries on business within and without the state, may be computed by reducing the amount determined pursuant to paragraph “a” by the amounts of nonrefundable credits under this subchapter and by multiplying this resulting amount by a fraction of which the resident’s or estate’s or trust’s net income allocated to Iowa, as determined in section 422.8, subsection 2, paragraph “b”, is the numerator and the resident’s or estate’s or trust’s total net income computed under section 422.7 is the denominator. If a resident shareholder, or an estate or trust with a situs in Iowa that is a shareholder, has elected to take advantage of this subparagraph (2), and for the next tax year elects not to take advantage of this subparagraph, the resident or estate or trust shareholder shall not reelect to take advantage of this subparagraph for the three tax years immediately following the first tax year for which the shareholder elected not to take advantage of this subparagraph, unless the director consents to the reelection. This subparagraph also applies to individuals who are residents of Iowa for less than the entire tax year.\n\n(b) This subparagraph (2) shall not affect the amount of the taxpayer’s checkoffs under this subchapter, the credits from tax provided under this subchapter, and the allocation of these credits between spouses if the taxpayers filed separate returns.\n\n2. a. The tax shall not be imposed on a resident or nonresident whose net income, as defined in section 422.7, is thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or less in the case of married persons filing jointly, heads of household, and surviving spouses or nine thousand dollars or less in the case of all other persons; but in the event that the payment of tax under this subchapter would reduce the net income to less than thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or nine thousand dollars as applicable, then the tax shall be reduced to that amount which would result in allowing the taxpayer to retain a net income of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or nine thousand dollars as applicable. The preceding sentence does not apply to estates or trusts. For the purpose of this subsection, the entire net income, including any part of the net income not allocated to Iowa, shall be taken into account. In calculating net income for purposes of this subsection, any amount of itemized or standard deduction, personal exemption deduction, or qualified business income deduction that was allowed as a deduction in computing federal taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code shall be added back. If the combined net income of a husband and wife exceeds thirteen thousand five hundred dollars, neither of them shall receive the benefit of this subsection, and it is immaterial whether they file a joint return or separate returns. However, if a husband and wife file separate returns and have a combined net income of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or less, neither spouse shall receive the benefit of this paragraph, if one spouse has a net operating loss and elects to carry back or carry forward the loss as provided under the Internal Revenue Code or in section 422.9. A person who is claimed as a dependent by another person as defined in section 422.12 shall not receive the benefit of this subsection if the person claiming the dependent has net income exceeding thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or nine thousand dollars as applicable or the person claiming the dependent and the person’s spouse have combined net income exceeding thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or nine thousand dollars as applicable.\n\nb. (1) In lieu of the computation in subsection 1, or in paragraph “a” of this subsection, if the married persons’ filing jointly, head of household’s, or surviving spouse’s net income exceeds thirteen thousand five hundred dollars, the regular tax imposed under this subchapter shall be the lesser of the alternate state individual income tax rate specified in subparagraph (2) times the portion of the net income in excess of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars or the regular tax liability computed without regard to this sentence. Taxpayers electing to file separately shall compute the alternate tax described in this paragraph using the total net income of the spouses. The alternate tax described in this paragraph does not apply if one spouse elects to carry back or carry forward a net operating loss as provided under the Internal Revenue Code or in section 422.9.\n\n(2) (a) (i) (A) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but before January 1, 2024, the alternate tax rate is 6.00 percent.\n\n(B) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2025, the alternate tax rate is 5.70 percent.\n\n(C) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2025, but before January 1, 2026, the alternate tax rate is 5.20 percent.\n\n(ii) This subparagraph division (a) is repealed January 1, 2026.\n\n(b) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, the alternate tax rate is 4.40 percent.\n\n3. a. The tax shall not be imposed on a resident or nonresident who is at least sixty-five years old on December 31 of the tax year and whose net income, as defined in section 422.7, is thirty-two thousand dollars or less in the case of married persons filing jointly, heads of household, and surviving spouses or twenty-four thousand dollars or less in the case of all other persons; but in the event that the payment of tax under this subchapter would reduce the net income to less than thirty-two thousand dollars or twenty-four thousand dollars as applicable, then the tax shall be reduced to that amount which would result in allowing the taxpayer to retain a net income of thirty-two thousand dollars or twenty-four thousand dollars as applicable. The preceding sentence does not apply to estates or trusts. For the purpose of this subsection, the entire net income, including any part of the net income not allocated to Iowa, shall be taken into account. In calculating net income for purposes of this subsection, any amount of itemized or standard deduction, personal exemption deduction, or qualified business income deduction that was allowed as a deduction in computing federal taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code shall be added back. If the combined net income of a husband and wife exceeds thirty-two thousand dollars, neither of them shall receive the benefit of this subsection, and it is immaterial whether they file a joint return or separate returns. However, if a husband and wife file separate returns and have a combined net income of thirty-two thousand dollars or less, neither spouse shall receive the benefit of this paragraph, if one spouse has a net operating loss and elects to carry back or carry forward the loss as provided under the Internal Revenue Code or in section 422.9. A person who is claimed as a dependent by another person as defined in section 422.12 shall not receive the benefit of this subsection if the person claiming the dependent has net income exceeding thirty-two thousand dollars or twenty-four thousand dollars as applicable or the person claiming the dependent and the person’s spouse have combined net income exceeding thirty-two thousand dollars or twenty-four thousand dollars as applicable.\n\nb. (1) In lieu of the computation in subsection 1 or 2, if the married persons’ filing jointly, head of household’s, or surviving spouse’s net income exceeds thirty-two thousand dollars, the regular tax imposed under this subchapter shall be the lesser of the alternate state individual income tax rate specified in subparagraph (2) times the portion of the net income in excess of thirty-two thousand dollars or the regular tax liability computed without regard to this sentence. Taxpayers electing to file separately shall compute the alternate tax described in this paragraph using the total net income of the spouses. The alternate tax described in this paragraph does not apply if one spouse elects to carry back or carry forward a net operating loss as provided under the Internal Revenue Code or in section 422.9.\n\n(2) (a) (i) (A) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but before January 1, 2024, the alternate tax rate is 6.00 percent.\n\n(B) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2025, the alternate tax rate is 5.70 percent.\n\n(C) For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2025, but before January 1, 2026, the alternate tax rate is 5.20 percent.\n\n(ii) This subparagraph division (a) is repealed January 1, 2026.\n\n(b) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, the alternate tax rate is 4.40 percent.\n\nc. This subsection applies even though one spouse has not attained the age of sixty-five, if the other spouse is at least sixty-five at the end of the tax year.\n\n4. The tax levied under this section shall be computed and collected as provided in this subchapter.\n\n5. The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all salaries received by federal officials or employees of the United States government as provided for herein.\n\n6. a. Upon determination of the latest cumulative inflation factor, the director shall multiply each dollar amount set forth in section 422.5A by this cumulative inflation factor, shall round off the resulting product to the nearest one dollar, and shall incorporate the result into the income tax forms and instructions for each tax year.\n\nb. This subsection is repealed on January 1, 2026.\n\n7. The state income tax of a taxpayer whose net income includes the gain or loss from the forfeiture of an installment real estate contract, the transfer of real or personal property securing a debt to a creditor in cancellation of that debt, or from the sale or exchange of property as a result of actual notice of foreclosure where the fair market value of the taxpayer’s assets exceeds the taxpayer’s liabilities immediately before such forfeiture, transfer, or sale or exchange shall not be greater than such excess, including any asset transferred within one hundred twenty days prior to such forfeiture, transfer, or sale or exchange. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of married taxpayers, except in the case of a husband and wife who live apart at all times during the tax year, the assets and liabilities of both spouses shall be considered in determining if the fair market value of the taxpayer’s assets exceed the taxpayer’s liabilities.\n\n8. In addition to the other taxes imposed by this section, a tax is imposed on the amount of a lump sum distribution for which the taxpayer has elected under section 402(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to be separately taxed for federal income tax purposes for the tax year. The rate of tax is equal to twenty-five percent of the separate federal tax imposed on the amount of the lump sum distribution. A nonresident is liable for this tax only on that portion of the lump sum distribution allocable to Iowa. The total amount of the lump sum distribution subject to separate federal tax shall be included in net income for purposes of determining eligibility under subsections 2 and 3, as applicable.\n\n9. In the case of income derived from the sale or exchange of livestock which qualifies under section 451(e) of the Internal Revenue Code because of drought, the taxpayer may elect to include the income in the taxpayer’s net income in the tax year following the year of the sale or exchange in accordance with rules prescribed by the director.\n\n10. If an individual’s federal income tax was forgiven for a tax year under section 692 of the Internal Revenue Code, because the individual was killed while serving in an area designated by the president of the United States or the United States Congress as a combat zone, the individual was missing in action and presumed dead, or the individual was killed outside the United States in a terroristic or military action while the individual was a military or civilian employee of the United States, the individual’s Iowa income tax is also forgiven for the same tax year.\n\n11. If a taxpayer repays in the current tax year certain amounts of income that were subject to tax under this subchapter in a prior year and a tax benefit would be allowed under similar circumstances under section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code, a tax benefit shall be allowed on the Iowa return.

The amount of income tax paid to another state or foreign country by a resident taxpayer of this state on income derived from sources outside of Iowa shall be allowed as a credit against the tax computed under this chapter, except that the credit shall not exceed what the amount of the Iowa tax would have been on the same income which was taxed by the other state or foreign country. The limitation on this credit shall be computed according to the following formula: Income earned outside of Iowa and taxed by another state or foreign country shall be divided by the total income of the resident taxpayer of Iowa. This quotient multiplied by the net Iowa tax as determined on the total income of the taxpayer as if entirely earned in Iowa shall be the maximum tax credit against the Iowa net tax.\n\nb. (1) For purposes of paragraph “a”, a resident partner of an entity taxed as a partnership for federal tax purposes, a resident shareholder of an S corporation, or a resident beneficiary of an estate or trust shall be deemed to have paid the resident partner’s, resident shareholder’s, or resident beneficiary’s pro rata share of entity-level income tax paid by the partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust to another state or foreign country on income that is also subject to tax under this subchapter, but only if the entity provides the resident partner, resident shareholder, or resident beneficiary a statement that documents the resident partner’s, resident shareholder’s, or resident beneficiary’s share of the income derived in the other state or foreign country, the income tax liability of the entity in that state or foreign country, and the income tax paid by the entity to that state or foreign country.\n\n(2) For purposes of paragraph “a”, a resident shareholder of a regulated investment company shall be deemed to have paid the shareholder’s pro rata share of entity-level income tax paid by the regulated investment company to another state or foreign country and treated as paid by its shareholders pursuant to section 853 of the Internal Revenue Code, but only if the regulated investment company provides the resident shareholder a statement that documents the resident shareholder’s share of the income derived in the other state or foreign country, the income tax liability of the regulated investment company in that state or foreign country, and the income tax paid by the regulated investment company to that state or foreign country.\n\n2. a. Nonresident’s net income allocated to Iowa is the net income, or portion of net income, which is derived from a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on within this state or income from any property, trust, estate, or other source within Iowa. However, income derived from a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on within this state and income from any property, trust, estate, or other source within Iowa shall not include distributions from pensions, including defined benefit or defined contribution plans, annuities, individual retirement accounts, and deferred compensation plans or any earnings attributable thereto so long as the distribution is directly related to an individual’s documented retirement and received while the individual is a nonresident of this state. If a business, trade, profession, or occupation is carried on partly within and partly without the state, only the portion of the net income which is fairly and equitably attributable to that part of the business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on within the state is allocated to Iowa for purposes of section 422.5, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, and section 422.13 and income from any property, trust, estate, or other source partly within and partly without the state is allocated to Iowa in the same manner, except that annuities, interest on bank deposits and interest-bearing obligations, and dividends are allocated to Iowa only to the extent to which they are derived from a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on within the state. Net income described in section 29C.24, subsection 3, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), and paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2), shall not be allocated and apportioned to the state, as provided in section 29C.24.\n\nb. A resident’s income, or the income of an estate or trust with a situs in Iowa, allocable to Iowa is the income determined under section 422.7 reduced by items of income and expenses from an S corporation that carries on business within and without the state when those items of income and expenses pass directly to the shareholders under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. These items of income and expenses are increased by the greater of the following:\n\n(1) The net income or loss of the corporation which is fairly and equitably attributable to this state under section 422.33, subsections 2 and 3.\n\n(2) Any cash or the value of property distributions which are made only to the extent that they are paid from income upon which Iowa income tax has not been paid, as determined under rules of the director, reduced by the amount of any of these distributions that are made to enable the shareholder to pay federal income tax on items of income, loss, and expenses from the corporation.\n\n3. Taxable income of resident and nonresident estates and trusts shall be allocated in the same manner as individuals.\n\n4. a. The director may, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, and when cost-efficient, administratively feasible, and of mutual benefit to both states, enter into reciprocal agreements with tax administration agencies of other states to further tax administration and eliminate duplicate withholding by exempting from Iowa taxation income earned from personal services in Iowa by residents of another state, if the other state provides a tax exemption for the same type of income earned from personal services by Iowa residents in the other state. For purposes of this subsection, “income earned from personal services” means wages, salaries, commissions, and tips, and earned income from other sources. This subsection does not authorize the department to withhold taxes on deferred compensation payments, pension distributions, and annuity payments when paid to a nonresident of the state of Iowa. All the terms of the agreements shall be described in the rules adopted by the department.\n\nb. A reciprocal agreement entered into on or after April 4, 2002, with a tax administration agency of another state shall not take effect until such agreement has been authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the general assembly and approved by the governor. A reciprocal agreement in effect on or after January 1, 2002, shall not be terminated by the state of Iowa unless the termination has been authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the general assembly and approved by the governor. An amendment to an existing reciprocal agreement does not constitute a new agreement.\n\n5. If the resident or part-year resident is a shareholder of an S corporation which has in effect an election under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, subsections 1 and 3 do not apply to any income taxes paid to another state or foreign country on the income from the corporation which has in effect an election under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n[C35, §6943-f8; C39, §6943.037, 6943.040, 6943.050; C46, 50, 54, 58, §422.5, 422.8, 422.18; C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §422.5, 422.8; 82 Acts, ch 1226, §3, 6]\n\n83 Acts, ch 16, §1, 2; 85 Acts, ch 243, §3; 88 Acts, ch 1028, §16; 92 Acts, ch 1224, §1, 2, 4; 94 Acts, ch 1149, §1, 2; 96 Acts, ch 1197, §16 – 18; 97 Acts, ch 111, §5, 6, 8; 2002 Acts, ch 1005, §10, 11; 2002 Acts, ch 1069, §5, 12, 14; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §242; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §121, 123, 124; 2016 Acts, ch 1095, §3, 14, 15\n\n; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §77, 97, 98, 119, 133, 134\n\n; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §94; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §115 – 117; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §1\n\nReferred to in §2.48, 29C.24, 260E.2, 422.5, 422.12B, 422.13, 422.16, 422.25A\n\n2020 amendment to subsection 1 applies retroactively to January 1, 2020, for tax years beginning on or after that date; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §117\n\n2018 strike of former subsection 4 takes effect January 1, 2023, and applies to tax years beginning on or after that date;\n\n2018 Acts, ch 1161, §134\n\n2021 Acts, ch 177, §1",

      "text": "422.16 Withholding of income tax at source — penalties — interest — declaration of estimated tax — bond.\n\n1. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, “withholding agent” means any individual, fiduciary, estate, trust, corporation, partnership or association in whatever capacity acting and including all officers and employees of the state of Iowa, or any municipal corporation of the state of Iowa and of any school district or school board of the state, or of any political subdivision of the state of Iowa, or any tax-supported unit of government that is obligated to pay or has control of paying or does pay to any resident or nonresident of the state of Iowa or the resident’s or nonresident’s agent any wages that are subject to the Iowa income tax in the hands of such resident or nonresident, or any of the above-designated entities making payment or having control of making such payment of any taxable Iowa income to any nonresident. The term “withholding agent” shall also include an officer or employee of a corporation or association, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member has the responsibility to perform an act under this section and who subsequently knowingly violates the provisions of this section. The term “withholding agent” shall also include every employer as defined in this subchapter and further defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n2. a. (1) Every withholding agent paying wages to an Iowa resident, or nonresident working in Iowa, shall deduct and withhold from the wages an amount which will approximate the annual tax liability of the person on a calendar year basis, calculated on the basis of tables to be prepared by the department and schedules or percentage rates, based on the wages, to be prescribed by the department.\n\n(2) Every employee or other person shall declare to the withholding agent the amount of the employee’s or other person’s withholding allowance to be used in applying the tables and schedules or percentage rates. However, the amount of withholding allowance declared shall not exceed the amount to which the employee or other person is entitled except as allowed under sections 3402(m)(1) and 3402(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and as allowed by rules prescribed by the director. The claiming of an amount of withholding allowance in excess of entitlement is a serious misdemeanor.\n\nb. (1) In the case of a nonresident having income subject to taxation by Iowa, but not subject to withholding of such tax under this subsection or subject to the provisions of section 422.16B, a withholding agent shall withhold from such income at the same rate as provided in this subsection. A withholding agent and nonresident shall be subject to the provisions of this section, according to the context, except that a withholding agent may be absolved of the requirement to withhold taxes from the income of a nonresident upon receipt of a certificate from the department issued in accordance with the provisions of section 422.17.\n\n(2) In the case of a nonresident having income from a trade or business carried on by the nonresident in whole or in part within the state of Iowa, the nonresident shall be considered to be subject to the provisions of this paragraph unless such trade or business is of such nature that the business entity itself, as a withholding agent, is required to and does withhold Iowa income tax from the distributions made to such nonresident from such trade or business.\n\nc. For the purposes of this subsection, at a rate specified by the department, state income tax shall be withheld from pensions, annuities, other similar periodic payments, and other income payments under sections 3402(o), 3402(p), 3402(s), 3405(a), 3405(b), and 3405(c) of the Internal Revenue Code made to Iowa residents if the payments are subject to Iowa tax.\n\nd. For the purposes of this subsection, state income tax shall be withheld on winnings in excess of six hundred dollars derived from gambling activities authorized under chapter 99B or 99G. State income tax shall be withheld on winnings in excess of one thousand dollars from gambling activities authorized under chapter 99D. State income tax shall be withheld on winnings in excess of one thousand two hundred dollars derived from slot machines authorized under chapter 99F.\n\ne. For the purposes of this subsection, state income tax shall be withheld at the highest rate described in section 422.5A from supplemental wages of an employee in those circumstances in which the employer treats the supplemental wages as wholly separate from regular wages for purposes of withholding and federal income tax is withheld from the supplemental wages under section 3402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n3. a. A withholding agent is not required to withhold state income tax from payments subject to taxation made to a nonresident for commodity credit certificates, grain, livestock, domestic fowl, or other agricultural commodities or products sold to a withholding agent by a nonresident or the nonresident’s representative, if the withholding agent provides on forms prescribed by the department information relating to the sales required by the department to determine the state income tax liabilities of a nonresident. However, a withholding agent may elect to make estimated tax payments on behalf of a nonresident on the basis of the net income of the nonresident from the agricultural commodities or products, if the estimated tax payments are made on or before the last day of the first month after the end of the tax years of the nonresident.\n\nb. Nonresidents engaged in any facet of feature film, television, or educational production using the film or videotape disciplines in the state are not subject to Iowa withholding if the employer has applied to the department for exemption from the withholding requirement and the department has determined that any nonresident receiving wages would be entitled to a credit against Iowa income taxes paid.\n\nc. Individuals described in section 29C.24 are not subject to withholding, as provided in that section.\n\n4. a. A withholding agent required to deduct and withhold tax under subsection 2 shall file a return on or before the last day of the month following the quarterly period on forms prescribed by the director and remit to the department the amount of tax due at the following frequencies:\n\n(1) A withholding agent shall remit income tax withheld on a quarterly basis if the withholding agent withholds less than six thousand dollars annually and no more than five hundred dollars in any one month. Payment shall be due on the same day as the quarterly return.\n\n(2) A withholding agent shall remit income tax withheld on a monthly basis if the withholding agent withholds more than five hundred dollars in any one month and not more than five thousand dollars in a semimonthly period. Payment shall be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the month of withholding, except that a deposit for the third month in a calendar quarter shall be due on the same day as the quarterly return.\n\n(3) A withholding agent shall remit income tax withheld on a semimonthly basis if the withholding agent withholds more than five thousand dollars in a semimonthly period. The first semimonthly deposit for the period from the first of the month through the fifteenth of the month is due on the twenty-fifth day of the month in which the withholding occurs. The second monthly deposit for the period from the sixteenth of the month through the end of the month is due on the tenth day of the month following the month in which the withholding occurs.\n\n(4) A withholding agent may elect to remit on an annual basis if the withholding agent employs not more than two employees and expects to employ the employees for the full calendar year. The electing withholding agent shall remit the full amount of income taxes required to be withheld from the wages of the employees for the full calendar year with the quarterly return for the first calendar quarter. The amount to be paid shall be computed as if the employees were employed for the full calendar year for the same wages and with the same pay periods as prevailed during the first quarter of the year with respect to such employees. The electing withholding agent shall only remit the lump sum payment with the written consent of all employees involved. The withholding agent shall be entitled to recover from the employee any part of the lump sum payment that represents an advance to the employee. If a withholding agent pays a lump sum with the first quarterly return, the withholding agent shall be excused from filing further quarterly returns for the calendar year involved unless the withholding agent hires other or additional employees.\n\nb. Every withholding agent on or before February 15 following the close of the calendar year in which the withholding occurs shall send to the department copies of income statements required by subsection 8. At the discretion of the director, the withholding agent shall not be required to send income statements if the information is available from the internal revenue service or other state or federal agencies.\n\nc. If the director has reason to believe that the collection of the tax provided for in subsection 2 is in jeopardy, the director may require the withholding agent to file a return as required in paragraph “a”, and pay the tax at any time, in accordance with section 422.30. The director may authorize incorporated banks, trust companies, or other depositories authorized by law which are depositories or financial agents of the United States or of this state, to receive any tax imposed under this chapter, in the manner, at the times, and under the conditions the director prescribes. The director shall also prescribe the manner, times, and conditions under which the receipt of the tax by those depositories is to be treated as payment of the tax to the department.\n\nd. The director, in cooperation with the department of management, may periodically change the filing and remittance thresholds by administrative rule if in the best interest of the state and the taxpayer.\n\n5. Every withholding agent who fails to withhold or pay to the department any sums required by this chapter to be withheld and paid, shall be personally, individually, and corporately liable to the state of Iowa, and any sum withheld in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2, shall be deemed to be held in trust for the state of Iowa. Notwithstanding section 489.304, this subsection applies to a member or manager of a limited liability company.\n\n6. In the event a withholding agent fails to withhold and pay over to the department any amount required to be withheld under subsection 2, such amount may be assessed against such withholding agent in the same manner as prescribed for the assessment of income tax under the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter VI.\n\n7. Whenever the director determines that any withholding agent has failed to withhold or pay over to the department sums required to be withheld under subsection 2, the unpaid amount shall be a lien as described in section 422.26, shall attach to the property of that withholding agent, and in all other respects the procedure with respect to such lien shall apply as set forth in section 422.26.\n\n8. a. Every withholding agent required to deduct and withhold tax under subsection 2 shall furnish to each employee, nonresident, or other person with respect to the income paid by the employer or withholding agent to each employee, nonresident, or other person during the calendar year, on or before January 31 of the succeeding year, or, in the case of an employee, if the employment of the employee is terminated before the close of the calendar year, within thirty days from the day on which the last payment of wages or other taxable income is made, if requested by the employee, but not later than January 31 of the following year, an income statement showing all of the following:\n\n(1) The name and address of the employer or withholding agent, and the taxpayer identification number of the employer or withholding agent.\n\n(2) The name of the employee, nonresident, or other person and the taxpayer identification number of that employee, nonresident, or other person, together with the last known address of the employee, nonresident, or other person to whom wages or other taxable income has been paid during the period.\n\n(3) The gross amount of wages or other taxable income paid to the employee, nonresident, or other person.\n\n(4) The total amount deducted and withheld as tax under the provisions of subsection 2.\n\n(5) The total amount of federal income tax withheld.\n\nb. An income statement required to be furnished by this subsection with respect to any wages or other taxable Iowa income or any additional information required to be displayed on the income statement shall be in such form or forms as the director may prescribe by rule.\n\n9. A withholding agent shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld or the amount actually deducted, whichever is greater, under subsection 2. Any amount deducted and withheld as tax under subsection 2 during any calendar year upon the wages of any employee, nonresident, or other person shall be allowed as a credit to the employee, nonresident, or other person against the tax imposed by section 422.5 for the tax year in which it was withheld, irrespective of whether or not such tax has been, or will be, paid by the withholding agent to the department as provided by this chapter.\n\n10. a. If the amount of income tax withheld by the withholding agent on behalf of an employee, nonresident, or other person after complying with this section is more than the income tax liability of said employee, nonresident, or other person as determined under the provisions of this subchapter, the overpayment of tax may first be credited against any income tax or installment payment then due the state of Iowa by the employee, nonresident, or other person for the tax year, and any balance of one dollar or more shall be refunded to the employee, nonresident, or other person with interest in accordance with section 421.60, subsection 2, paragraph “e”.\n\nb. Amounts less than one dollar shall be refunded to the taxpayer, nonresident, or other person only upon written application, in accordance with section 422.73, and only if the application is filed within twelve months after the due date of the return.\n\nc. Refunds in the amount of one dollar or more provided for by this subsection shall be paid by the treasurer of state by warrants drawn by the director of the department of administrative services, or an authorized employee of the department of administrative services, and the taxpayer’s return of income shall constitute a claim for refund for this purpose, except in respect to amounts of less than one dollar. There is appropriated, out of any funds in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated, a sum sufficient to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n11. a. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a withholding agent required to furnish or file an income statement required by this chapter is subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars for each occurrence of the following:\n\n(1) Willful failure to furnish an employee, nonresident, or other person with an income statement.\n\n(2) Willfully furnishing an employee, nonresident, or other person with a false or fraudulent income statement.\n\n(3) Willful failure to file an income statement with the department.\n\n(4) Willfully filing a false or fraudulent income statement with the department.\n\nb. A withholding agent is subject to the penalty as provided in section 421.27. Any penalty assessed under section 421.27 shall be in addition to the tax or additional tax due under this section. The taxpayer shall also pay interest on the tax or additional tax at the rate in effect under section 421.7, for each month counting each fraction of a month as an entire month, computed from the date the semimonthly, monthly, or quarterly deposit form was required to be filed. The penalty and interest become a part of the tax due from the withholding agent.\n\nc. If any withholding agent, being a domestic or foreign corporation, required under the provisions of this section to withhold on wages or other taxable Iowa income subject to this chapter, fails to withhold the amounts required to be withheld, make the required returns or remit to the department the amounts withheld, the director may, having exhausted all other means of enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, certify such fact or facts to the secretary of state, who shall thereupon cancel the articles of incorporation or foreign registration statement, as the case may be, of such corporation, and the rights of such corporation to carry on business in the state of Iowa shall cease. The secretary of state shall immediately notify by registered mail such domestic or foreign corporation of the action taken by the secretary of state. The provisions of section 422.40, subsection 3, shall be applicable.\n\nd. The department shall, upon request of any fiduciary, furnish said fiduciary with a certificate of acquittance showing that no liability as a withholding agent exists with respect to the estate or trust for which said fiduciary acts, provided the department has determined that there is no such liability.\n\n12. a. (1) Taxpayers filing a return shall make estimated tax payments if their Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be expected to amount to two hundred dollars or more for the year.\n\n(2) In the cases of farmers and fishermen, the exceptions provided in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to making estimated payments apply.\n\nb. (1) The estimated tax shall be paid in quarterly installments. The first installment shall be paid on or before the last day of the fourth month of the taxpayer’s tax year for which the estimated payments apply. The other installments shall be paid on or before the last day of the sixth month of the tax year, the last day of the ninth month of the tax year, and the last day of the first month after the tax year. A taxpayer may elect to pay an installment prior to the due date.\n\n(2) If a taxpayer filing a return has reason to believe that the taxpayer’s Iowa income tax may increase or decrease, either for purposes of meeting the requirement to make estimated tax payments or for the purpose of increasing or decreasing estimated tax payments, the taxpayer shall increase or decrease any subsequent estimated tax payments accordingly.\n\n(3) Any tax still payable after applying credits for taxes paid through withholding, estimated tax, and composite return tax, is due and payable on or before the end of the fourth month following the close of the tax year.\n\nc. If a taxpayer is unable to make the taxpayer’s estimated tax payments, the payments may be made by a duly authorized agent, or by the guardian or other person charged with the care of the person or property of the taxpayer.\n\nd. (1) Estimated tax paid is a credit against the amount of tax found payable on a final, completed return, as provided in subsection 10, relating to the credit for the tax withheld against the tax found payable on a return properly and correctly prepared under sections 422.5 through 422.25.\n\n(2) Any overpayment of one dollar or more shall be refunded to the taxpayer and the return constitutes a claim for refund for this purpose. Amounts less than one dollar shall not be refunded.\n\n(3) The method provided by section 6654 of the Internal Revenue Code for determining what is applicable to the addition to tax for underpayment of the tax payable applies to persons required to make payments of estimated tax under this section except the amount to be added to the tax for underpayment of estimated tax is an amount determined at the rate in effect under section 421.7. This addition to tax specified for underpayment of the tax payable is not subject to waiver provisions relating to reasonable cause, except as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. Underpayment of estimated tax shall be determined in the same manner as provided under the Internal Revenue Code and the exceptions in the Internal Revenue Code also apply.\n\ne. In lieu of claiming a refund, the taxpayer may elect to have the overpayment shown on the taxpayer’s final, completed return for the taxable year credited to the taxpayer’s tax liability for the following taxable year.\n\n13. The director shall enter into an agreement with the secretary of the treasury of the United States with respect to withholding of income tax as provided by this chapter, pursuant to an Act of Congress, section 1207 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-455, amending 5 U.S.C. §5517.\n\n14. a. The director may, when necessary and advisable in order to secure the collection of the tax required to be deducted and withheld or the amount actually deducted, whichever is greater, require a withholding agent to file with the director a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to conduct business in this state and approved by the insurance commissioner as to solvency and responsibility, in an amount as the director may fix, to secure the payment of the tax and penalty due or which may become due. In lieu of the bond, securities shall be kept in the custody of the department and may be sold by the director at public or private sale, without notice to the depositor, if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax and penalty due. Upon a sale, any surplus above the amounts due under this section shall be returned to the withholding agent who deposited the securities.\n\nb. If the withholding agent fails to file the bond as requested by the director to secure collection of the tax, the withholding agent is subject to penalty for failure to file the bond. The penalty is equal to fifteen percent of the tax the withholding agent is required to withhold on an annual basis. However, the penalty shall not exceed five thousand dollars.\n\n15. The director may allow additional time for filing documents required under this section with the department in the case of illness, disability, absence, or if good cause is shown.\n\n[C39, §6943.048; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §422.16; 81 Acts, ch 131, §4 – 6, ch 133, §1, 4; 82 Acts, ch 1022, §1, 2, 8, ch 1023, §29, ch 1180, §2, 8]\n\n83 Acts, ch 160, §3, 4; 83 Acts, ch 179, §11; 84 Acts, ch 1173, §4; 86 Acts, ch 1007, §23 – 25; 86 Acts, ch 1208, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1241, §16; 87 Acts, ch 115, §55; 87 Acts, ch 214, §4\n\n; 87 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1, §26\n\n; 88 Acts, ch 1028, §25, 26; 88 Acts, ch 1157, §1; 89 Acts, ch 6, §4, 5; 89 Acts, ch 251, §17, 18; 90 Acts, ch 1172, §8; 90 Acts, ch 1248, §11\n\n[Unnumbered paragraph 2 of subsection 1 was inadvertently deleted in the 1991 Code and 1991 Code Supplement]\n\n91 Acts, ch 215, §4, 8\n\n; 92 Acts, 2nd Ex, ch 1001, §238\n\n; 94 Acts, ch 1165, §13 – 15, 45, 47, 48; 99 Acts, ch 151, §6, 89; 2002 Acts, ch 1151, §6; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2003 Acts, ch 178, §111, 121; 2003 Acts, ch 179, §142; 2004 Acts, ch 1101, §46; 2005 Acts, ch 140, §40, 73; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §101; 2007 Acts, ch 185, §3; 2007 Acts, ch 186, §16; 2008 Acts, ch 1162, §135, 154, 155; 2008 Acts, ch 1184, §54; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §86; 2015 Acts, ch 116, §28 – 30; 2016 Acts, ch 1095, §5, 14, 15; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §5, 15, 16, 126, 133, 134; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §94; 2021 Acts, ch 151, §12, 13, 15; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §1; 2022 Acts, ch 1032, §58, 59; 2022 Acts, ch 1061, §19 – 22; 2023 Acts, ch 5, §8 – 10; 2023 Acts, ch 66, §99; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §17\n\nReferred to in §29C.24, 99B.8, 99D.16, 99F.18, 99G.31, 260E.5, 260G.4A, 260J.1, 403.19A, 421.62, 422.4, 422.16B, 422.17, 422.38, 904.809\n\nA taxpayer making an election under section 422.16C is not required to make estimated tax payments for a tax year beginning prior to May 11, 2023; see 2023 Acts, ch 78, §4\n\nFor future amendment to subsection 2, paragraph e, effective January 1, 2026, see 2023 Acts, ch 115, §20, 21\n\nWith respect to amendments to subsection 1, paragraph c, by 2023 Acts, ch 5, §8 – 10 that were effective from February 20, 2023, until July 1, 2023, and applied to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and amendments by 2023 Acts, ch 66, §99, see Code editor’s note at the beginning of this Code volume\n\nSection stricken and rewritten",

(1) A pass-through entity shall file a composite return on behalf of all nonresident members and shall report and pay the income or franchise tax imposed under this chapter at the maximum state income or franchise tax rate applicable to the member under section 422.5A, 422.33, or 422.63 on the nonresident members’ distributive shares of the income from the pass-through entity.\n\n(2) The tax rate applicable to a tiered pass-through entity shall be the maximum state income tax rate under section 422.5A.\n\nb. The composite return is due and shall be filed by the due date of the pass-through entity’s annual return required under section 422.14, 422.15, or 422.36, including extensions. The return shall be on a form prescribed by the department showing the total amounts paid or credited to the pass-through entity’s nonresident members, the amounts of income or franchise tax remitted in accordance with this section, if any, and such other information as the department may require. A pass-through entity shall furnish to its nonresident members a record of the amount of Iowa income or franchise tax remitted on behalf of such nonresident member in the manner and form prescribed by the department.\n\nc. The Iowa income or franchise tax on the composite return is due on and shall be paid by the due date of the pass-through entity’s annual return required under section 422.14, 422.15, or 422.36, without extensions.\n\n3. a. A pass-through entity is liable to the state for the payment of the tax required to be remitted under this section, together with applicable interest and penalties, but is not liable to any nonresident member for any amount withheld from distributions to or from the distributive share of such nonresident member and remitted in compliance with this section.\n\nb. If a pass-through entity fails to pay any amount of tax required under this section and thereafter the tax is paid by the nonresident member, the amount of tax as paid by the nonresident member shall not be collected from the pass-through entity, but such payment by the nonresident member shall not relieve the pass-through entity from any penalty or interest associated with the failure to pay.\n\n4. a. A nonresident member that has been included on a composite return filed pursuant to this section shall receive credit for Iowa income or franchise tax paid on the nonresident member’s behalf by the pass-through entity, and any amounts in excess of the nonresident member’s Iowa tax liability for the applicable tax period may be refunded to the nonresident member with interest in accordance with section 421.60, subsection 2, paragraph “e”. The nonresident member’s Iowa return shall constitute a claim for refund for this purpose. In lieu of claiming a refund, the nonresident member may elect to have the overpayment shown on the nonresident member’s final, completed return for the taxable year credited to the taxpayer’s tax liability for the following taxable year.\n\nb. A tiered pass-through entity shall be subject to the same requirements to file a composite return and pay tax under this section with respect to the distributive shares of the tiered pass-through entity’s income. Any Iowa income or franchise tax paid on the tiered pass-through entity’s behalf by another pass-through entity may be applied against that tiered pass-through entity’s own composite tax remittance obligation imposed under this section.\n\nc. A nonresident individual included on a composite tax return filed pursuant to this section shall be relieved of the requirement to file an individual income tax return under section 422.13 if income from the pass-through entity is the nonresident individual’s only Iowa-source income.\n\n5. A pass-through entity shall not be required to remit Iowa income or franchise tax on behalf of a nonresident member if any of the following apply:\n\na. The pass-through entity is a publicly traded partnership as defined in section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, provided the publicly traded partnership files with the department an information return that reports the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information requested by the department for each unit holder with an income in this state from the publicly traded partnership in excess of five hundred dollars.\n\nb. A composite return is not required as provided in section 29C.24.\n\nc. The pass-through entity meets any of the following requirements for the tax year:\n\n(1) The pass-through entity is a financial institution subject to the franchise tax under section 422.60 and files a franchise tax return required under section 422.62 and pays any franchise tax shown due on the return.\n\n(2) The pass-through entity wholly owns one or more financial institutions subject to the franchise tax under section 422.60 that are treated as disregarded entities for federal and Iowa income tax purposes, and at least ninety percent of the gross income of the pass-through entity for the tax year is also reportable income on the franchise tax return of the financial institutions wholly owned by the pass-through entity, and such financial institutions file the franchise tax returns required under section 422.62 and pay any franchise tax shown due on the franchise tax return.\n\nd. The department determines by rule or through a ruling that the nonresident member’s income should not be subject to composite return reporting, such as a member that is exempt from Iowa income or franchise tax.\n\n6. If the director determines that it is necessary for the efficient administration of this chapter, the director may require that a composite return be filed for nonresidents other than nonresident members of a pass-through entity.\n\n7.

The provisions of section 422.16, subsection 4, paragraph “c”, and subsections 7, 11, and 14, applying to withholding agents, shall apply in the same manner to pass-through entities under this section.\n\n8. a. For the efficient administration of this chapter, the director may require or provide for the composite return on the same form as or combined with a pass-through entity’s annual return required under section 422.14, 422.15, or 422.36, but in such case the composite return shall be considered a separate return for purposes of this chapter and section 421.27.\n\nb. (1) If a pass-through entity is required to file its annual return under section 422.14, 422.15, or 422.36 in an electronic format, the pass-through entity shall file its composite return for the same taxable year in an electronic format specified by the department.\n\n(2) This paragraph applies to any form or schedule supporting a return required to be electronically filed or any amended return if the amended return meets any of the circumstances requiring electronic filing in this paragraph.\n\nc.

An individual in the armed forces of the United States serving in an area designated by the president of the United States or the United States Congress as a combat zone or as a qualified hazardous duty area, or deployed outside the United States away from the individual’s permanent duty station while participating in an operation designated by the United States secretary of defense as a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. §101(a)(13), or which became such a contingency operation by the operation of law, or an individual serving in support of those forces, is allowed the same additional time period after leaving the combat zone or the qualified hazardous duty area, or ceasing to participate in such contingency operation, or after a period of continuous hospitalization, to file a state income tax return or perform other acts related to the department, as would constitute timely filing of the return or timely performance of other acts described in section 7508(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. An individual on active duty federal military service in the armed forces, armed forces military reserve, or national guard who is deployed outside the United States in other than a combat zone, qualified hazardous duty area, or contingency operation is allowed the same additional period of time described in section 7508(a) of the Internal Revenue Code to file a state income tax return or perform other acts related to the department. For the purposes of this subsection, “other acts related to the department” includes filing claims for refund for any tax administered by the department, making tax payments other than withholding payments, filing appeals on the tax matters, filing other tax returns, and performing other acts described in the department’s rules. The additional time period allowed applies to the spouse of the individual described in this subsection to the extent the spouse files jointly with the individual or when the spouse is a party with the individual to any matter for which the additional time period is allowed.\n\n3. The department shall make available to persons required to make personal income tax returns under the provisions of this chapter, and when such income is derived mainly from salaries and wages or from the operation of a business or profession, a form which shall take into consideration the normal deductions and credits allowable to any such taxpayer, and which will permit the computation of the tax payable without requiring the listing of specific deductions and credits. In arriving at schedules for payment of taxation under such forms the department shall as nearly as possible base such schedules upon a total of deductions and credits which will result in substantially the same payment as would have been made by such taxpayer were the taxpayer to specifically list the taxpayer’s allowable deductions and credits. In lieu of such return any taxpayer may elect to list permissible deductions and credits as provided by law. It is the intent and purpose of this provision to simplify the procedure of collection of personal income tax, and the director shall have the power in any case when deemed necessary or advisable to require any taxpayer, who has made a return in accordance with the schedule provided for in this section, to make an additional return in which all deductions and credits are specifically listed. The department may revise the schedules adopted in connection with such simplified form whenever such revision is necessitated by changes in federal income tax laws, or to maintain the collection of substantially the same amounts from taxpayers as would be received were the specific listing of deductions and credits required.\n\n4. The department shall provide space on the prescribed income tax form, wherein the taxpayer shall enter the name of the school district of the taxpayer’s residence. Such place shall be indicated by prominent type. A nonresident taxpayer shall so indicate. If such information is not supplied on the tax return it shall be deemed an incompleted return.\n\n5. The director shall determine for the 2023 calendar year and each subsequent calendar year the annual and cumulative inflation factors for each calendar year to be applied to tax years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year. The director shall compute the new dollar amounts as specified to be adjusted in section 422.5 by the latest cumulative inflation factor and round off the result to the nearest one dollar. The annual and cumulative inflation factors determined by the director are not rules as defined in section 17A.2, subsection 11.\n\n6. The department shall provide on income tax forms or in the instruction booklets in a manner that will be noticeable to the taxpayers a statement that, even though the taxpayer may not have any federal or state income tax liability, the taxpayer may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit or state child and dependent care credit. The statement shall also contain notice of where the taxpayer may check on the taxpayer’s eligibility for these credits.\n\n7. If married taxpayers file a joint return in accordance with rules prescribed by the director, both spouses are jointly and severally liable for the total tax due on the return, except when one spouse is eligible for relief under criteria established pursuant to section 6015 of the Internal Revenue Code. The department may notify the nonrequesting spouse or former spouse and permit, by rule, the intervention of a nonrequesting spouse or former spouse when relief from joint and several liability is requested.\n\n[C35, §6943-f17; C39, §6943.053; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §422.21]\n\n85 Acts, ch 230, §6; 87 Acts, ch 115, §56\n\n; 87 Acts, 2nd Ex, ch 1, §11\n\n; 88 Acts, ch 1028, §28; 89 Acts, ch 268, §7, 8; 90 Acts, ch 1248, §13; 91 Acts, ch 159, §17; 91 Acts, ch 196, §3; 94 Acts, ch 1165, §16, 48; 2000 Acts, ch 1146, §9, 11; 2002 Acts, ch 1069, §8, 11, 14; 2003 Acts, ch 142, §8, 11; 2009 Acts, ch 47, §1, 2; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §127, 133, 134; 2020 Acts, ch 1063, §223; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §75, 76; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §1\n\nReferred to in §257.23, 422.7(22)(a), 422.16, 422.38, 422D.3, 541B.3\n\n2018 amendments to subsections 2, 5, and 7 are effective January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years beginning on or after that date;\n\n2018 Acts, ch 1161, §133, 134\n\n2021 Acts, ch 177, §1",

      "text": "422.25 Computation of tax, interest, and penalties — limitation.\n\n1. a. For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) “Federal adjustment” means a change to an item or amount required to be determined under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder that is used by the taxpayer to compute state tax owed whether such change results from action by the internal revenue service, or the filing of a timely amended federal return or timely federal refund claim. A federal adjustment is positive to the extent that it increases Iowa taxable income as determined under this title and is negative to the extent that it decreases Iowa taxable income as determined under this title.\n\n(2) “Federal adjustments report” means the method or form required by the department by rule to report final federal adjustments or final federal partnership adjustments as defined in section 422.25A, and in the case of any entity taxed as a partnership or S corporation for federal income tax purposes, identifies all owners that hold an interest directly in such entity and provides the effect of the final federal adjustments on such owner’s Iowa income.\n\n(3) “Final determination date” means the following:\n\n(a) Except as provided in subparagraph divisions (b) and (c), for federal adjustments arising from an internal revenue service audit or other action by the internal revenue service, the final determination date is the first day on which no federal adjustments arising from that audit or other action remain to be finally determined, whether by internal revenue service decision with respect to which all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted, by agreement, or, if appealed or contested, by a final decision with respect to which all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted. For agreements required to be signed by the internal revenue service and the taxpayer, the final determination date is the date on which the last party signed the agreement.\n\n(b) For federal adjustments arising from an internal revenue service audit or other action by the internal revenue service, if the taxpayer filed as a member of a consolidated return under section 422.37, the final determination date is the first day on which no related federal adjustments arising from that audit or other action remain to be finally determined, as described in subparagraph division (a), for the entire group.\n\n(c) For federal adjustments arising from a timely filed amended federal return or a timely filed federal refund claim, or if it is a federal adjustment reported on a timely amended federal return or other similar report filed pursuant to section 6225(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the final determination date is the day on which the amended return, refund claim, or other similar report was filed.\n\n(4) “Final federal adjustment” means a federal adjustment after the final determination date for that federal adjustment has passed.\n\nb. Within three years after the return is filed or within three years after the return became due, including any extensions of time for filing, whichever time is the later, the department shall examine the return and determine the tax. However, if the taxpayer omits from income an amount which will, under the Internal Revenue Code, extend the statute of limitations for assessment of federal tax to six years under the federal law, the period for examination and determination is six years.\n\nc. (1) The period for examination and determination of the correct amount of tax is unlimited in the case of a false or fraudulent return made with the intent to evade tax or in the case of a failure to file a return.\n\n(2) If a person required to file a return with the department fails to file the return with the department, the department may, at any time, estimate the tax due based upon information or knowledge the department is able to obtain.\n\n(3) If the department estimates an amount of tax under subparagraph (2), the following shall apply:\n\n(a) The department shall issue a notice of assessment to the person for which the tax is estimated in accordance with section 421.60. The notice of assessment shall not be appealable pursuant to section 422.28 or 422.29, except to appeal the determination that the person is required to file a return.\n\n(b) The department shall include a statement with the notice that if the person files a return within three years from the date on the notice of assessment, the department may replace the assessment with the amount shown due on the person’s return, plus any applicable penalty and interest, and the department may examine that return and determine the tax, penalty, and interest within the period provided in this section.\n\n(c) If the person fails to file a return within three years from the date on the notice of assessment, the person may pay the tax, penalty, and interest and file a refund claim within the time period provided in section 422.73, or may request relief under section 421.5.\n\nd. In lieu of the period of limitation for any prior year for which an overpayment of tax or an elimination or reduction of an underpayment of tax due for that prior year results from the carryback to that prior year of a net operating loss or net capital loss, the period is the period of limitation for the taxable year of the net operating loss or net capital loss which results in the carryback.\n\ne. (1) In addition to the applicable period of limitation for examination and determination in paragraph “b”, “c”, or “d”, the department may make an examination and determination at any time within one year from the date of receipt by the department of a federal adjustments report with respect to a final federal adjustment or final federal partnership adjustment as defined in section 422.25A for a particular tax year. In order to begin the running of the one-year period, the federal adjustments report related to the final federal adjustment or final federal partnership adjustment shall be transmitted to the department by the taxpayer in the form and manner specified by the department by rule.\n\n(2) The department in its discretion may adopt rules to establish a de minimis amount for which subparagraph (1) shall not apply and the taxpayer shall not be required to file a federal adjustments report.\n\n(3) The department may in its discretion and when administratively feasible adopt a process through rule by which a taxpayer may make estimated payments of tax expected to result from a pending internal revenue service audit prior to the filing of a federal adjustments report with the department. The process shall provide that the estimated tax payments shall be credited against any tax liability ultimately found to be due to the state from the internal revenue service audit and will limit the accrual of further statutory interest on that liability. The process shall also provide that if the estimated tax payments exceed the final tax liability and statutory interest ultimately determined to be due, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit for the excess, without interest, provided the taxpayer files a federal adjustments report, or a claim for refund or credit of tax under section 422.73, no later than one year following the final determination date.\n\nf. The period of examination and determination is unlimited under this title in the case of any action by the department to recover or rescind any tax expenditure as defined by section 2.48, subsection 1, or any other incentive or assistance, due to a failure to meet or maintain the requirements of a program administered by the economic development authority.\n\n2. a. If the tax found due under subsection 1 is greater than the amount paid, the department shall compute the amount due, together with interest and penalties as provided in paragraph “b”, and shall mail a notice of assessment to the taxpayer and, if applicable, to the taxpayer’s authorized representative of the total, which shall be computed as a sum certain, with interest computed to the last day of the month in which the notice is dated.\n\nb. In addition to the tax or additional tax determined by the department under subsection 1, the taxpayer shall pay interest on the tax or additional tax at the rate in effect under section 421.7 for each month counting each fraction of a month as an entire month, computed from the date the return was required to be filed. In addition to the tax or additional tax, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty as provided in section 421.27.\n\n3. a. If the amount of the tax as determined by the department is less than the amount paid, the excess shall be refunded with interest in accordance with section 421.60, subsection 2, paragraph “e”.\n\nb. Notwithstanding section 421.60, subsection 2, paragraph “e”, and paragraph “a” of this subsection, when the net operating loss or net capital loss carryback to a prior year eliminates or reduces an underpayment of tax due for an earlier year, the full amount of the underpayment of tax shall bear interest at the rate in effect under section 421.7 for each month counting each fraction of a month as an entire month from the due date of the tax for the earlier year to the last day of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss occurred.\n\n4. a. All payments received must be credited first to the penalty and interest accrued and then to the tax due. If payments in multiple tax periods are unpaid, payments received shall be credited first to the penalty and interest accrued and then tax due for the earliest period, and then credited to each following tax period in chronological order from the earliest tax period to the latest tax period. Payments required to be made within a tax period must be credited first to the earliest deposit period within the tax period. For purposes of this subsection, the department shall not reapply prior payments made on or before the due date of the original return by the taxpayer to penalty or interest determined to be due after the date of those prior payments, except that the taxpayer and the department may agree to apply payments in accordance with rules adopted by the director when there are both agreed and unagreed to items as a result of an examination.\n\nb. As used in this subsection, “tax period” means a period of time for which a return is required.\n\n5. A person or withholding agent required to supply information, to pay tax, or to make, sign, or file a deposit form or return required by this subchapter, who willfully makes a false or fraudulent deposit form or return, or willfully fails to pay the tax, supply the information, or make, sign, or file the deposit form or return, at the time or times required by law, is guilty of a fraudulent practice.\n\n6. The certificate of the director to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required under the provisions of this subchapter shall be prima facie evidence thereof except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n7. The periods of limitation provided by this section may be extended by the taxpayer by signing a waiver agreement to be provided by the department. The agreement shall stipulate the period of extension and the year or years to which the extension applies. It shall provide that a claim for refund may be filed by the taxpayer at any time during the period of extension.\n\n8. A person or withholding agent who willfully attempts in any manner to defeat or evade a tax imposed by this subchapter or the payment of the tax, upon conviction for each offense is guilty of a class “D” felony.\n\n9. A prosecution for any offense defined in this section must be commenced within six years after the commission thereof, and not after.\n\n10. If a taxpayer files an amended return within sixty days prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitations described in subsection 1, the department has sixty days from the date of receipt of the amended return to issue an assessment for any applicable tax, interest, or penalty.\n\n[C35, §6943-f21; C39, §6943.057; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §422.25; 81 Acts, ch 131, §8, ch 133, §2, 4, ch 134, §1, 2; 82 Acts, ch 1180, §3, 8]\n\n83 Acts, ch 160, §5; 84 Acts, ch 1025, §1; 84 Acts, ch 1173, §5; 86 Acts, ch 1007, §26; 86 Acts, ch 1241, §19; 88 Acts, ch 1028, §29; 89 Acts, ch 251, §19; 90 Acts, ch 1172, §9; 94 Acts, ch 1133, §3, 4, 16; 95 Acts, ch 83, §3, 34; 99 Acts, ch 151, §8, 9, 89; 99 Acts, ch 152, §3, 40; 2002 Acts, ch 1150, §5; 2013 Acts, ch 110, §1; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §6, 15, 16; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §94; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §17, 31, 63, 71; 2021 Acts, ch 151, §4; 2022 Acts, ch 1032, §60; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §26, 40\n\nReferred to in §99G.30A, 257.22, 321.105A, 421.27, 422.16, 422.16C, 422.25A, 422.25C, 422.39, 422.66, 422.73, 422D.3, 423.42, 423A.6, 423B.6, 423C.4, 423D.4, 423G.5, 428A.8, 452A.23\n\nFraudulent practices, see §714.8 – 714.14\n\n2020 strike and rewrite of subsections 1 and 2 applies to federal adjustments and federal partnership adjustments that have a final determination date after July 1, 2020; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §71\n\nLegislative intent regarding enactment of subsection 1, paragraph f;\n\n2020 Acts, ch 1118, §30\n\n2023 amendment to subsection 1, paragraph c effective January 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §40\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph c amended",

Election for partnership or tiered partners to pay.\n\na. An audited partnership, or a tiered partner of an audited partnership that receives a notification under subsection 4 of a final federal partnership adjustment arising from a partnership level audit, may make an election to pay as provided under this subsection.\n\nb. An audited partnership or tiered partner shall make an election to pay under this subsection in the manner and form prescribed by the department. The audited partnership or tiered partner making an election to pay shall file a completed federal adjustments report, notify each of the direct partners of such partner’s distributive share of the adjustments, and pay on behalf of its partners an amount calculated in paragraph “c”, including any applicable penalty and interest. These requirements shall all be fulfilled within one of the following time periods:\n\n(1) For the audited partnership, no later than ninety days after the final determination date of the audited partnership.\n\n(2) For a direct tiered partner, no later than one hundred eighty days after the final determination date of the audited partnership.\n\n(3) For an indirect tiered partner, within ninety days after the time for filing and furnishing statements to a tiered partner and the partner of the tiered partner, as established by section 6226 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.\n\nc. The amount due under this subsection from an audited partnership or tiered partner shall be calculated as follows:\n\n(1) Exclude from final federal partnership adjustments and any positive reallocation adjustments the distributive share of such adjustments reported to an exempt partner that holds an interest directly in the audited partnership if the audited partnership is making the election or that holds an interest directly in the tiered partner if the tiered partner is making the election, but only to the extent the distributive share is not unrelated business income.\n\n(2) Determine the total distributive share of all final federal partnership adjustments and positive reallocation adjustments as modified by this title that are reported to corporate partners, and to exempt partners to the extent the distributive share is unrelated business income, and allocate and apportion such adjustments as provided in section 422.33 at the partnership or tiered partner level, and multiply the resulting amount by the maximum state corporate income tax rate pursuant to section 422.33 for the reviewed year.\n\n(3) Determine the total distributive share of all final federal partnership adjustments and positive reallocation adjustments as modified by this title that are reported to nonresident individual partners and nonresident fiduciary partners and allocate and apportion such adjustments as provided in section 422.33 at the partnership or tiered partner level, and multiply the resulting amount by the maximum individual income tax rate pursuant to section 422.5A for the reviewed year.\n\n(4) For the total distributive share of all final federal partnership adjustments and positive reallocation adjustments as modified by this title that are reported to tiered partners:\n\n(a) Determine the amount of such adjustments which are of a type that would be subject to sourcing to Iowa under section 422.8, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, as a nonresident, and then determine the portion of this amount that would be sourced to Iowa under those provisions as if the tiered partner were a nonresident.\n\n(b) Determine the amount of such adjustments which are of a type that would not be subject to sourcing to Iowa under section 422.8, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, as a nonresident.\n\n(c) Determine the portion of the amount in subparagraph division (b) that can be established, as prescribed by the department by rule, to be properly allocable to indirect partners that are nonresident partners or other partners not subject to tax on the adjustments.\n\n(d) Multiply the total of the amounts determined in subparagraph divisions (a) and (b), reduced by any amount determined in subparagraph division (c), by the highest individual income tax rate pursuant to section 422.5A for the reviewed year.\n\n(5) For the total distributive share of all final federal partnership adjustments and positive reallocation adjustments as modified by this title that are reported to resident individual partners and resident fiduciary partners, multiply that amount by the highest individual income tax rate pursuant to section 422.5A for the reviewed year.\n\n(6) (a) Total the amounts computed pursuant to subparagraphs (2) through (5) and calculate any interest and penalty as provided under this title. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, interest and penalties on the amount due by the audited partnership or tiered partner shall be computed from the due date of the reviewed year return without extension, and shall be imposed as if the audited partnership or tiered partner was required to pay tax or show tax due on the original return for the reviewed year, except that a specified business subject to the penalty in section 421.27, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, for the reviewed year shall not also be subject to the penalty in section 421.27, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, on the amount due for that reviewed year pursuant to the election to pay.\n\n(b) The director may establish rules providing for the calculation of amounts due under this subsection for federal partnership adjustments that affect state tax owed but that do not fit within the calculation in subparagraphs (2) through (5), such as tax credit changes. The director may establish rules that include changes related to state-specific issues following a state partnership audit in the election to pay and calculation of amounts due under this subsection, including but not limited to allocation and apportionment. Interest and penalty shall be computed in the same manner as described in subparagraph division (a).\n\nd. Adjustments subject to the election in this subsection do not include any adjustments arising from an administrative adjustment request.\n\ne. An audited partnership or tiered partner not otherwise subject to any reporting or payment obligation to Iowa that makes an election under this subsection consents to be subject to the Iowa laws related to reporting, assessment, collection, and payment of Iowa tax, interest, and penalties calculated under the election.\n\n6. Modified reporting and payment method. The department may adopt procedures for an audited partnership or tiered partner to enter into an agreement with the department to use an alternative reporting and payment method, including applicable time requirements or any other provision of this section. The audited partnership or tiered partner must demonstrate that the requested method will reasonably provide for the reporting and payment of taxes, penalties, and interest due under the provisions of this section. Application for approval of an alternative reporting and payment method must be made by the audited partnership or tiered partner within the time for making an election to pay under subsection 5 and in the manner prescribed by the department. Approval of such an alternative reporting and payment method shall be at the discretion of the department.\n\n7. Effect of election by partnership or tiered partner and payment of amount due.\n\na. The election made under subsection 5 is irrevocable, unless in the discretion of the director, the director determines otherwise.\n\nb. The amount determined in subsection 5, when properly reported and paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner, shall be treated as paid on behalf of the partners of such audited partnership or tiered partner on the same final federal partnership adjustments, provided, however, that no partner may take any deduction or credit for the amount, claim a refund of the amount, or include the amount on such partner’s Iowa return in any manner.\n\nc. In the event another state offers to an audited partnership or tiered partner a similar election to pay state tax resulting from final federal partnership adjustments, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a resident who holds an interest directly in that audited partnership or tiered partner, as the case may be, from claiming a credit for taxes paid by the resident to another state under section 422.8, subsection 1, for any amounts paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner on such resident partner’s behalf to another state, provided such payment otherwise meets the requirements of section 422.8, subsection 1.\n\nd. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from assessing direct partners and indirect partners for taxes they owe in the event that a partnership or tiered partner fails to timely make any report or payment required by this section for any reason.\n\n8. Assessments of additional Iowa income tax, interest, and penalties, and claims for refund, arising from final federal partnership adjustments.\n\na. The department shall assess additional Iowa income tax, interest, and penalties arising from final federal partnership adjustments in the same manner as provided in this title unless a different treatment is provided by this subsection. Since final federal partnership adjustments are determined at the partnership level, any assessment issued to partners shall not be appealable by the partner. The department may assess any taxes, including on-behalf-of amounts, interest, and penalties arising from the final federal partnership adjustments if it issues a notice of assessment to the partnership, tiered partner, or other direct or indirect partner on or before the expiration of the applicable limitations period specified in section 422.25.\n\nb. In addition to the period for claiming a refund or credit provided in section 422.73, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, and notwithstanding section 422.73, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, a partnership, tiered partner, or other direct or indirect partner, as the case may be, may file a claim for refund of Iowa income tax arising directly or indirectly from a final federal partnership adjustment arising from a partnership level audit on or before the date which is one year from the date the federal adjustments report for that final federal partnership adjustment was required to be filed by such person under this section.\n\n9.

(1) It is unlawful for the director, or any person having an administrative duty under this chapter, or any present or former officer or other employee of the state authorized by the director to examine returns, to willfully or recklessly divulge in any manner, the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation under this chapter of records and equipment of any person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return; or to willfully or recklessly permit any return or copy of a return or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person except as provided by law.\n\n(2) It is unlawful for any person to willfully inspect, except as authorized by the director, any return or return information.\n\n(3) However, the director may authorize examination of such state returns and other state information which is confidential under this section, if a reciprocal arrangement exists, by tax officers of another state or the federal government.\n\nb. The director may, by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 17A, authorize examination of state information and returns by other officers or employees of this state to the extent required by their official duties and responsibilities. Disclosure of state information to tax officers of another state is limited to disclosures which have a tax administrative purpose and only to officers of those states which by agreement with this state limit the disclosure of the information as strictly as the laws of this state protecting the confidentiality of returns and information. The director shall place upon the state tax form a notice to the taxpayer that state tax information may be disclosed to tax officials of another state or of the United States for tax administrative purposes.\n\nc. The department shall not authorize the examination of tax information by officers and employees of this state, another state, or of the United States if the officers or employees would otherwise be required to obtain a judicial order to examine the information if it were to be obtained from another source, and if the purpose of the examination is other than for tax administration. However, the director may provide sample individual income tax information to be used for statistical purposes to the legislative services agency. The information shall not include the name or mailing address of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s social security number. Any information contained in an individual income tax return which is provided by the director shall only be used as a part of a database which contains similar information from a number of returns. The legislative services agency shall not have access to the income tax returns of individuals. Each request for individual income tax information shall contain a statement by the director of the legislative services agency that the individual income tax information received by the legislative services agency shall be used solely for statistical purposes. This subsection does not prevent the department from authorizing the examination of state returns and state information under the provisions of section 252B.9. This subsection prevails over any general law of this state relating to public records.\n\nd. The director shall provide state tax returns and return information to the auditor of state, to the extent that the information is necessary to complete the annual audit of the department required by section 11.2. The state tax returns and return information provided by the director shall remain confidential and shall not be included in any public documents issued by the auditor of state.\n\n2. Federal tax returns, copies of returns, and return information as defined in section 6103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, which are required to be filed with the department for the enforcement of the income tax laws of this state, shall be held as confidential by the department and subject to the disclosure limitations in subsection 1.\n\n3. a. Unless otherwise expressly permitted by section 8G.4, section 11.41, section 96.11, subsection 6, section 421.17, subsections 22, 23, and 26, section 421.17, subsection 27, paragraph “k”, section 421.17, subsection 31, section 252B.9, section 321.40, subsection 6, sections 321.120, 421.19, 421.28, 421.65, 422.20, and 452A.63, this section, or another provision of law, a tax return, return information, or investigative or audit information shall not be divulged to any person or entity, other than the taxpayer, the department, or internal revenue service for use in a matter unrelated to tax administration.\n\nb. This prohibition precludes persons or entities other than the taxpayer, the department, or the internal revenue service from obtaining such information from the department, and a subpoena, order, or process which requires the department to produce such information to a person or entity, other than the taxpayer, the department, or internal revenue service for use in a nontax proceeding is void.\n\n4. A person violating subsection 1, 2, 3, or 6 is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.\n\n5. The director may disclose taxpayer identity information to the press and other media for purposes of notifying persons entitled to tax refunds when the director, after reasonable effort and lapse of time, has been unable to locate the persons.\n\n6. a. The department may enter into a written informational exchange agreement for tax administration purposes with a city or county which is entitled to receive funds due to a local hotel and motel tax or a local sales and services tax. The written informational exchange agreement shall designate no more than two paid city or county employees that have access to actual return information relating to that city’s or county’s receipts from a local hotel and motel tax or a local sales and services tax.\n\nb. City or county employees designated to have access to information under this subsection are deemed to be officers and employees of the state for purposes of the restrictions pursuant to subsection 1 pertaining to confidential information. The department may refuse to enter into a written informational exchange agreement if the city or county does not agree to pay the actual cost of providing the information and the department may refuse to abide by a written informational exchange agreement if the city or county does not promptly pay the actual cost of providing the information or take reasonable precautions to protect the information’s confidentiality.\n\n7. a. Notwithstanding subsection 3, the director shall provide state tax returns and return information in response to a subpoena issued by the court pursuant to\n\nrule of criminal procedure 2.15\n\ncommanding the appearance before the attorney general or an assistant attorney general if the subpoena is accompanied by affidavits from such person and from a sworn peace officer member of the department of public safety affirming that the information is necessary for the investigation of a felony violation of chapter 124 or chapter 706B.\n\nb. The affidavits accompanying the subpoenas and the information provided by the director shall remain a confidential record which may be disseminated only to a prosecutor or peace officer involved in the investigation, or to the taxpayer who filed the information and to the court in connection with the filing of criminal charges or institution of a forfeiture action. A person who knowingly files a false affidavit with the director to secure information or who divulges information received under this subsection in a manner prohibited by this subsection commits a serious misdemeanor.\n\n8. a. Prior to the record in an appeal or contested case being made available for public inspection, the department shall redact the following information from any pleading, exhibit, attachment, motion, written evidence, final order, decision, or opinion contained in that record:\n\n(1) A financial account number.\n\n(2) An account number generated by the department to identify an audit or examination.\n\n(3) A social security number.\n\n(4) A federal employer identification number.\n\n(5) The name of a minor.\n\n(6) A medical record or other medical information.\n\n(7) A return as defined in section 421.6.\n\nb. Upon a motion filed by the taxpayer, the department may redact from the record in an appeal or contested case any other information from a pleading, exhibit, attachment, motion, or written evidence, if the taxpayer proves by clear and convincing evidence that the release of such information would disclose a trade secret or be a clear, unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\n\nc. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, when making final orders, decisions, or opinions available for public inspection, the department may disclose the items in paragraph “a” if the department determines such information is relevant or necessary to the resolution or decision of the appeal or case.\n\nd. Except as described in paragraphs “a” and “b”, all information contained in a pleading, exhibit, attachment, motion, written evidence, final order, decision, opinion, and the record in an appeal or contested case is subject to examination to the extent provided by chapter 22.\n\n9.
