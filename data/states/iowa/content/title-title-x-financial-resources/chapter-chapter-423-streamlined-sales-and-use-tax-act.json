The department may determine the manner in which a marketplace facilitator or marketplace seller shall claim the liability relief provided in this subparagraph division.\n\n(ii) The liability relief provided in subparagraph subdivision (i) shall not exceed the following percentage of the total sales and use tax due on Iowa sales made or facilitated by a marketplace facilitator for marketplace sellers and sourced to this state during a calendar year, which Iowa sales shall not include sales by the marketplace facilitator or affiliates of the marketplace facilitator:\n\n(A) For Iowa sales made or facilitated during the 2019 calendar year, ten percent.\n\n(B) For Iowa sales made or facilitated during calendar years 2020 through 2024, five percent.\n\n(C) For Iowa sales made or facilitated during the 2025 calendar year, three percent.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subparagraph (3) shall be construed to relieve any person of liability for collecting but failing to remit to the department sales and use tax.\n\n(d) A marketplace facilitator is deemed to be an agent of any marketplace seller making retail sales through a marketplace of the marketplace facilitator.\n\nd.

The sourcing rules described in this section apply to sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, and all services other than telecommunications services. This section only applies to determine a seller’s obligation to pay or collect and remit Iowa sales or use tax with respect to the seller’s sale of a product. This section does not affect the obligation of a purchaser or lessee to remit tax on the use of the product to the taxing jurisdictions in which the use occurs. A seller’s obligation to collect Iowa sales tax or Iowa use tax only occurs if the sale is sourced to this state. Iowa sales tax applies to a sale sourced to Iowa made by a seller subject to section 423.1, subsection 48, or section 423.14A.\n\n1. Sales, excluding leases or rentals, of products shall be sourced as follows:\n\na. When the product is received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location.\n\nb. When the product is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller.\n\nc. When paragraphs “a” and “b” do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith.\n\nd. When paragraphs “a”, “b”, and “c” do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith.\n\ne. When paragraphs “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” do not apply, including the circumstance where the seller is without sufficient information to apply the previous rules, then the location will be determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped, from which the specified digital product or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller, or from which the service was provided disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.\n\n2. The lease or rental of tangible personal property, other than property identified in subsection 3 or section 423.16, shall be sourced as follows:\n\na. For a lease or rental that requires recurring periodic payments, the first periodic payment is sourced the same as a retail sale in accordance with the provisions of subsection 1. Periodic payments made subsequent to the first payment are sourced to the primary property location for each period covered by the payment. The primary property location shall be as indicated by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. The property location shall not be altered by intermittent use at different locations, such as use of business property that accompanies employees on business trips and service calls.\n\nb. For a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale in accordance with the provisions of subsection 1.\n\nc. This subsection does not affect the imposition or computation of sales or use tax on leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis, or on the acquisition of property for lease.\n\n3.

For the purposes of this section, “bad debt” means an amount properly calculated pursuant to section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code then adjusted to exclude financing charges or interest, sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, and repossessed property.\n\n2. In computing the amount of tax due, a seller may deduct bad debts from the total amount upon which the tax is calculated for any return. Any deduction taken or refund paid which is attributed to bad debts shall not include interest.\n\n3. A seller may deduct bad debts on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the seller’s books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this subsection, a seller who is not required to file federal income tax returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the seller’s books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the seller were required to file a federal income tax return.\n\n4. If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the seller subsequently collects the debt in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is made.\n\n5. A seller may obtain a refund of tax on any amount of bad debt that exceeds the amount of taxable sales within the period allowed for refund claims by section 423.47. However, the period allowed for refund claims shall be measured from the due date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.\n\n6. For the purposes of computing a bad debt deduction or reporting a payment received on a previously claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account shall be applied first to the price of the property or service and tax thereon, proportionally, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.\n\n2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 2, §114, 205\n\nReferred to in §423.53, 423.57",

The department may waive the liability of the immediate successor under this subsection if the immediate successor exercised good faith in establishing the amount of the previous liability.\n\n3. Event sponsor’s liability for sales or use tax. A person sponsoring a flea market or a craft, antique, coin, or stamp show or similar event shall obtain from every retailer selling tangible personal property, specified digital products, or taxable services at the event proof that the retailer possesses a valid sales or use tax permit or secure from the retailer a statement, taken in good faith, that tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services offered for sale are not subject to sales tax. Failure to do so renders a sponsor of the event liable for payment of any sales tax, interest, and penalty due and owing from any retailer selling property or services at the event. Sections 423.31, 423.37, 423.39, 423.40, 423.41, and 423.42 apply to the sponsors. For purposes of this subsection, a “person sponsoring a flea market or a craft, antique, coin, or stamp show or similar event” does not include a marketplace facilitator as defined in section 423.14A, subsection 1, an organization which sponsors an event determined to qualify as an event involving casual sales pursuant to section 423.3, subsection 39, or the state fair or a fair as defined in section 174.1.\n\n4. Liability of affiliates.\n\na. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if any retailer required to collect and remit sales and use tax pursuant to sections 423.14, 423.14A, and 423.29, or any other provision of this chapter, fails to do so, all affiliates that directly, indirectly, or constructively control the retailer shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax, penalty, and interest under this chapter, regardless of whether the affiliate is a retailer.\n\nb. Pursuant to paragraph “a”, the department may elect to assess the full amount of any tax, penalty, and interest against the retailer, an affiliate of the retailer described in paragraph “a”, or any combination of the retailer and the retailer’s affiliates described in paragraph “a”.\n\nc. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department has the discretion to deem an affiliate of a retailer an agent or alter ego of that retailer.\n\nd. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department has the discretion to disregard or look through any organizational structure of an enterprise in order to assess and collect any tax, penalty, and interest against an affiliate that is acting to benefit an affiliate or an enterprise of which the affiliate is a part.\n\n2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 2, §126, 205; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §55; 2006 Acts, ch 1158, §50; 2007 Acts, ch 179, §3, 10; 2016 Acts, ch 1095, §10, 14; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §213, 214, 229; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §47; 2022 Acts, ch 1138, §15, 16; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §28, 29, 40\n\nReferred to in §99G.30A, 321.105A, 421.26, 421.28, 423.14, 423.34, 423.57, 423A.6, 423B.6, 423C.4, 423D.4, 423G.5\n\nLegislative intent regarding 2020 amendment to subsection 1; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §49\n\n2023 amendment to subsection 1, paragraphs a and b effective January 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §40\n\n2023 amendment to subsection 3 effective January 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §40\n\nSubsection 1, paragraphs a and b amended\n\nSubsection 3 amended",

Every person desiring to engage in or transact business as a retailer shall file with the department an application for a permit to collect sales or use tax. Every application for a sales or use tax permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the director and shall set forth any information the director may require. The application shall be signed by an owner of the business if a natural person; in the case of a retailer which is an association or partnership, by a member or partner; and in the case of a retailer which is a corporation, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application, to which shall be attached the written evidence of the person’s authority.\n\n2. a. Notwithstanding subsection 1, if any person will make taxable sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or furnish services to any state agency, that person shall, prior to the sale, apply for and receive a permit to collect sales or use tax pursuant to this section. A state agency shall not purchase tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services from any person unless that person has a valid, unexpired permit issued pursuant to this section and is in compliance with all other requirements in this chapter imposed upon retailers, including but not limited to the requirement to collect and remit sales and use tax and file sales and use tax returns.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, “state agency” means any executive, judicial, or legislative department, commission, board, institution, division, bureau, office, agency, or other entity of state government.\n\n3. To collect sales or use tax, the applicant must have a permit for each place of business in the state of Iowa. The department may deny a permit to an applicant who is substantially delinquent in paying a tax due, or the interest or penalty on the tax, administered by the department at the time of application or if the applicant had a previous delinquent liability with the department. If the applicant is a partnership, a permit may be denied if a partner is substantially delinquent in paying any delinquent tax, penalty, or interest or if a partner had a previous delinquent liability with the department. If the applicant is a corporation, a permit may be denied if any officer having a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation owes any delinquent tax, penalty, or interest or if any officer having a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation had a previous delinquent liability with the department.\n\n4. a. The department shall grant and issue to each applicant a permit for each place of business in this state where sales or use tax is collected. A permit is not assignable and is valid only for the person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated or at a place of relocation within the same county if the ownership remains the same.\n\nb. If an applicant is making sales outside Iowa for use in this state or furnishing services outside Iowa, the product or result of which will be used in this state, that applicant shall be issued one sales or use tax permit by the department applicable to these out-of-state sales or services.\n\nc. If an applicant is required to collect sales or use tax and is not included in the definition of a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state in section 423.1, subsection 48, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), the applicant shall be issued one sales or use tax permit by the department regardless of the number of locations from which sales are made.\n\n5. Permits issued under this section are valid and effective until revoked by the department.\n\n6. If the holder of a permit fails to comply with any of the provisions of this subchapter or of subchapter II or III or any order or rule of the department adopted under those subchapters or is substantially delinquent in the payment of a tax administered by the department or the interest or penalty on the tax, or if the person is a corporation and if any officer having a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation owes any delinquent tax of the permit-holding corporation, or interest or penalty on the tax, administered by the department, the director may revoke the permit. The director shall send notice by mail to a permit holder informing that person of the director’s intent to revoke the permit and of the permit holder’s right to a hearing on the matter. If the permit holder petitions the director for a hearing on the proposed revocation, after giving ten days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing in accordance with section 17A.18, subsection 3, the matter may be heard and a decision rendered. The director may restore permits after revocation. The director shall adopt rules setting forth the period of time a retailer must wait before a permit may be restored or a new permit may be issued. The waiting period shall not exceed ninety days from the date of the revocation of the permit.\n\n7. a. Sellers who are not regularly engaged in selling at retail and do not have a permanent place of business, but who are temporarily engaged in selling from trucks, portable roadside stands, concessionaires at state, county, district, or local fairs, carnivals, or the like, shall report and remit the sales tax on a seasonal basis, under rules the director shall provide for the efficient collection of the sales tax. This subsection applies to sellers who are temporarily engaged in furnishing services.\n\nb. Persons engaged in selling tangible personal property, specified digital products, or furnishing services shall not be required to obtain or retain a sales or use tax permit for a place of business at which taxable sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or taxable performance of services will not occur.\n\n8. The provisions of subsection 1, dealing with the lawful right of a retailer to transact business, as applicable, apply to persons having receipts from furnishing services enumerated in section 423.2, except that a person holding a permit pursuant to subsection 1 shall not be required to obtain any separate sales or use tax permit for the purpose of engaging in business involving the services.\n\n9. a. Except as provided in paragraph “b”, purchasers, users, and consumers of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or enumerated services taxed pursuant to subchapter II or III of this chapter or chapter 423B may be authorized, pursuant to rules adopted by the director, to remit tax owed directly to the department instead of the tax being collected and paid by the seller. To qualify for a direct pay tax permit, the purchaser, user, or consumer must accrue a tax liability of more than four thousand dollars in tax under subchapters II and III in a semimonthly period and make deposits and file returns pursuant to section 423.31. This authority shall not be granted or exercised except upon application to the director and then only after issuance by the director of a direct pay tax permit.\n\nb. The granting of a direct pay tax permit is not authorized for any of the following:\n\n(1) Taxes imposed on the sales, furnishing, or service of gas, electricity, water, heat, pay television service, and communication service.\n\n(2) Taxes imposed under section 423.26, section 423.26A, and chapter 423C.\n\n2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 2, §129, 205; 2008 Acts, ch 1113, §113; 2008 Acts, ch 1134, §66; 2008 Acts, ch 1184, §57; 2010 Acts, ch 1108, §9, 15; 2012 Acts, ch 1110, §20; 2013 Acts, ch 122, §3; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §216 – 219, 229; 2022 Acts, ch 1138, §18 – 20\n\nReferred to in §423.31, 423.40, 423.58, 423B.5",

If an amount of tax represented by a retailer to a consumer or user as constituting tax due is computed upon a sales price that is not taxable or the amount represented is in excess of the actual taxable amount and the amount represented is actually paid by the consumer or user to the retailer, the excess amount of tax paid shall be returned to the consumer or user upon notification to the retailer by the department that an excess payment exists.\n\n2. If an amount of tax represented by a retailer to a consumer or user as constituting tax due is computed upon a sales price that is not taxable or the amount represented is in excess of the actual taxable amount and the amount represented is actually paid by the consumer or user to the retailer, the excess amount of tax paid shall be returned to the consumer or user upon proper notification to the retailer by the consumer or user that an excess payment exists. “Proper” notification is written notification which allows a retailer at least sixty days to respond and which contains enough information to allow a retailer to determine the validity of a consumer’s or user’s claim that an excess amount of tax has been paid. No cause of action shall accrue against a retailer for excess tax paid until sixty days after proper notice has been given the retailer by the consumer or user.\n\n3. In the circumstances described in subsections 1 and 2, a retailer has the option to either return any excess amount of tax paid to a consumer or user, or to remit the amount which a consumer or user has paid to the retailer to the department.\n\n4. a. The department shall issue or the seller may separately provide exemption certificates in the form prescribed by the director, including certificates not made of paper, which conform to the requirements of paragraph “c”, to assist retailers in properly accounting for nontaxable sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services to purchasers for a nontaxable purpose. The department shall also allow the use of exemption certificates for those circumstances in which a sale is taxable but the seller is not obligated to collect tax from the buyer.\n\nb. The sales tax liability for all sales of tangible personal property and specified digital products and all sales of services is upon the seller and the purchaser unless the seller takes from the purchaser a valid exemption certificate stating under penalty of perjury that the purchase is for a nontaxable purpose and is not a retail sale as defined in section 423.1, or the seller is not obligated to collect tax due, or unless the seller takes a fuel exemption certificate pursuant to subsection 5. If the tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services are purchased tax free pursuant to a valid exemption certificate and the tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services are used or disposed of by the purchaser in a nonexempt manner, the purchaser is solely liable for the taxes and shall remit the taxes directly to the department and sections 423.31, 423.37, 423.39, 423.40, 423.41, and 423.42 shall apply to the purchaser.\n\nc. A valid exemption certificate is an exemption certificate which is complete and correct according to the requirements of the director.\n\nd. The protection afforded a seller by paragraph “b” does not apply to a seller who fraudulently fails to collect tax or to a seller who solicits purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption.\n\ne. If the circumstances change and as a result the tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services are used or disposed of by the purchaser in a nonexempt manner or the purchaser becomes obligated to pay the tax, the purchaser is liable solely for the taxes and shall remit the taxes directly to the department in accordance with this subsection.\n\n5. a. The department shall issue or the seller may separately provide fuel exemption certificates in the form prescribed by the director.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) “Fuel” includes gas, electricity, water, heat, steam, and any other tangible personal property consumed in creating heat, power, or steam.\n\n(2) “Fuel consumed in processing” means fuel used or consumed for processing including grain drying, for providing heat or cooling for livestock buildings or for greenhouses or buildings or parts of buildings dedicated to the production of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants intended for sale in the ordinary course of business, for use in aquaculture production, or for generating electric current, or in implements of husbandry engaged in agricultural production.\n\n(3) “Fuel exemption certificate” means an exemption certificate given by the purchaser under penalty of perjury to assist retailers in properly accounting for nontaxable sales of fuel consumed in processing.\n\n(4) “Substantial change” means a change in the use or disposition of tangible personal property and services by the purchaser such that the purchaser pays less than ninety percent of the purchaser’s actual sales tax liability. A change includes a misstatement of facts in an application made pursuant to paragraph “d” or in a fuel exemption certificate.\n\nc. The seller may accept a completed fuel exemption certificate, as prepared by the purchaser, for three years unless the purchaser files a new completed exemption certificate. If the fuel is purchased tax free pursuant to a fuel exemption certificate which is taken by the seller, and the fuel is used or disposed of by the purchaser in a nonexempt manner, the purchaser is solely liable for the taxes, and shall remit the taxes directly to the department and sections 423.31, 423.37, 423.39, 423.40, 423.41, and 423.42 shall apply to the purchaser.\n\nd. The purchaser may apply to the department for its review of the fuel exemption certificate. In this event, the department shall review the fuel exemption certificate within twelve months from the date of application and determine the correct amount of the exemption. If the amount determined by the department is different than the amount that the purchaser claims is exempt, the department shall promptly notify the purchaser of the determination. Failure of the department to make a determination within twelve months from the date of application shall constitute a determination that the fuel exemption certificate is correct as submitted. A determination of exemption by the department is final unless the purchaser appeals to the director for a revision of the determination within sixty days after the date of the notice of determination. The director shall grant a hearing, and upon the hearing, the director shall determine the correct exemption and notify the purchaser of the decision by mail. The decision of the director is final unless the purchaser seeks judicial review of the director’s decision under section 422.29 within sixty days after the date of the notice of the director’s decision. Unless there is a substantial change, the department shall not impose penalties pursuant to section 423.40 both retroactively to purchases made after the date of application and prospectively until the department gives notice to the purchaser that a tax or additional tax is due, for failure to remit any tax due which is in excess of a determination made under this section. A determination made by the department pursuant to this subsection does not constitute an audit for purposes of section 423.37.\n\ne. If the circumstances change and the fuel is used or disposed of by the purchaser in a nonexempt manner, the purchaser is solely liable for the taxes and shall remit the taxes directly to the department in accordance with paragraph “c”.\n\nf. The purchaser shall attach documentation to the fuel exemption certificate which is reasonably necessary to support the exemption for fuel consumed in processing. If the purchaser files a new exemption certificate with the seller, documentation shall not be required if the purchaser previously furnished the seller with this documentation and substantial change has not occurred since that documentation was furnished or if fuel consumed in processing is separately metered and billed by the seller.\n\n6.

The following provisions apply to any seller who registers under the agreement:\n\na. The seller may register on-line.\n\nb. Registration under the agreement and the collection of Iowa sales and use taxes shall not be used as factors in determining whether the seller has nexus with Iowa for any tax.\n\nc. The seller is not required to pay registration fees or other charges.\n\nd. A written signature from the seller is not required.\n\ne. The seller may register by way of an agent. The agent’s appointment shall be in writing and submitted to the department if requested by the department.\n\nf. The seller may cancel its registration at any time under procedures adopted by the governing board established pursuant to the agreement. Cancellation does not relieve the seller of its liability for remitting any Iowa taxes collected.\n\ng. Upon the registration of a seller, the department shall provide to the seller information regarding the options available for the filing of returns and remittances. Such information shall include information on the requirements of filing simplified electronic returns and remittances.\n\n3. The following additional responsibilities and rights apply to model sellers:\n\na. A model 1 seller’s obligation to calculate, collect, and remit sales and use taxes shall be performed by its certified service provider, except for the seller’s obligation to remit tax on its own purchases. As the seller’s agent, the certified service provider is liable for its model 1 seller’s sales and use tax due Iowa on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this section. A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the certified service provider establishes that the certified service provider is not liable in accordance with the agreement. In the absence of liability relief established by the certified service provider, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider. A model 1 seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider. The director is authorized to perform a system check of the model 1 seller and review the seller’s procedures to determine if the certified service provider’s system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller’s transactions are being processed by the certified service provider.\n\nb. A model 2 seller shall calculate the amount of tax due on a transaction by the use of a certified automated system, but shall collect and remit tax on its own sales. A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to this state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. A seller that uses a certified automated system remains responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax.\n\nc. A model 3 seller shall use its own proprietary automated system to calculate tax due and collect and remit tax on its own sales. A model 3 seller is liable for the failure of its proprietary automated system to meet the applicable performance standard.\n\nd. A model 2, model 3, or model 4 seller making no sales sourced in the state in the preceding twelve months may elect to be registered in the state as a seller that anticipates making no sales sourced in the state. Making such an election shall not relieve the seller of the obligation to collect and remit sales or use taxes on sales sourced in the state.\n\n4.

Sellers and certified service providers using databases derived from zip codes or state or vendor provided address-based databases are relieved from liability to this state or its local taxing jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider relying on erroneous data provided by this state on tax rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction assignments. If this state provides an address-based system for assigning taxing jurisdictions, the director is not required to provide liability relief for errors resulting from reliance on a database derived from zip codes and provided by this state if the director has given adequate notice, as determined by the governing board, to affected parties of the decision to end this relief.\n\n2. a. Model 2 sellers and certified service providers are relieved of liability to Iowa for any failure to charge and collect the correct amount of sales or use tax if this failure results from the model 2 seller’s or the certified service provider’s reliance upon this state’s certification to the governing board that Iowa has accepted the governing board’s certification of a piece of software as a certified automated system. The relief provided by this paragraph to a model 2 seller or certified service provider does not extend to a seller or provider who has incorrectly classified an item or transaction into the product-based exemptions portion of a certified automated system. However, any model 2 seller or certified service provider who has relied upon an individual listing of items or transactions within a product definition approved by the governing board or Iowa may claim the relief allowed by this paragraph.\n\nb. If the department determines that an item or transaction is incorrectly classified as to its taxability, the department shall notify the model 2 seller or certified service provider of the incorrect classification. The model 2 seller or certified service provider shall have ten days to revise the classification after receipt of notice of the determination. Upon expiration of the ten days, the model 2 seller or certified service provider shall be liable for the failure to collect the correct amount of sales or use taxes due and owing to the member state.\n\n3. a. Sellers and certified service providers are relieved from liability to this state or its local taxing jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider relying on erroneous data provided in the state’s taxability matrix.\n\nb. Sellers and certified service providers that rely upon a prior version of the state’s taxability matrix shall be relieved of liability to the state and its local taxing jurisdictions until the first day of the calendar month that is at least thirty days after notice of a change to the taxability matrix is submitted by the state to the governing board.\n\n2003 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 2, §145, 205; 2006 Acts, ch 1158, §79, 80; 2012 Acts, ch 1066, §6; 2015 Acts, ch 94, §2\n\nReferred to in §423.34A",

Amnesty is provided for uncollected or unpaid sales or use tax to a seller who registers to pay or to collect and remit applicable sales or use tax on sales made to purchasers in this state in accordance with the terms of the agreement, provided the seller was not so registered in this state in the twelve-month period preceding the commencement of Iowa’s participation in the agreement.\n\nb. Amnesty precludes assessment of the seller for uncollected or unpaid sales or use tax together with penalty or interest for sales made during the period the seller was not registered in this state, provided registration occurs within twelve months of the commencement of Iowa’s participation in the agreement.\n\nc. Amnesty shall be provided to any seller lawfully registered under the agreement by any other member state prior to the date of the commencement of Iowa’s participation in the agreement.\n\n2. Amnesty is not available to a seller with respect to any matter or matters for which the seller received notice of the commencement of an audit and which audit is not yet finally resolved, including any related administrative and judicial processes.\n\n3. Amnesty is not available for sales or use taxes already paid or remitted or to taxes collected by the seller.\n\n4. Amnesty is fully effective absent the seller’s fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact as long as the seller continues registration and continues payment or collection and remittance of applicable sales or use taxes for a period of at least thirty-six months. The statute of limitations applicable to asserting a tax liability is tolled during this thirty-six month period.\n\n5. Amnesty is applicable only to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a seller and not to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a buyer.\n\n6.

This notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy policy statement accessible by the public on the official internet site of the certified service provider.\n\nd. Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer’s status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased.\n\ne.
