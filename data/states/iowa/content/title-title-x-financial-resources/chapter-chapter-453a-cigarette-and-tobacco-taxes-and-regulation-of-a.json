Issuance or denial.\n\na. The department shall issue state permits to distributors, wholesalers, and cigarette vendors, and retailers that make delivery sales of alternative nicotine products and vapor products, subject to the conditions provided in this subchapter. If an out-of-state retailer makes delivery sales of alternative nicotine products or vapor products, an application shall be filed with the department and a permit shall be issued for the out-of-state retailer’s principal place of business. Cities may issue retail permits to retailers with a place of business located within their respective limits. County boards of supervisors may issue retail permits to retailers with a place of business in their respective counties, outside of the corporate limits of cities.\n\nb. The department may deny the issuance of a permit to a distributor, wholesaler, vendor or retailer who is substantially delinquent in the payment of a tax due, or the interest or penalty on the tax, administered by the department at the time of application. If the applicant is a partnership, a permit may be denied if a partner is substantially delinquent on any delinquent tax, penalty or interest. If the applicant is a corporation, a permit may be denied if any officer having a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation owes any delinquent tax, interest or penalty of the applicant corporation.\n\nc. A city or county shall submit a duplicate of any application for a retail permit to the department within thirty days of the issuance. The department shall submit the current list of all retail permits issued to the department of health and human services by the last day of each quarter of a state fiscal year.\n\n3.

A permit shall not be granted or issued until the applicant has paid for the period ending June 30 next, to the department or the city or county granting the permit, the fees provided for in this subchapter. The annual state permit fee for a distributor, cigarette vendor, and wholesaler is one hundred dollars when the permit is granted during the months of July, August, or September. However, whenever a state permit holder operates more than one place of business, a duplicate state permit shall be issued for each additional place of business on payment of five dollars for each duplicate state permit, but refunds as provided in this subchapter do not apply to any duplicate permit issued.\n\nb. The fee for retail permits is as follows when the permit is granted during the months of July, August, or September:\n\n(1) In places outside any city, fifty dollars.\n\n(2) In cities of less than fifteen thousand population, seventy-five dollars.\n\n(3) In cities of fifteen thousand or more population, one hundred dollars.\n\nc. If any permit is granted during the months of October, November, or December, the fee shall be three-fourths of the above maximum schedule; if granted during the months of January, February, or March, one-half of the maximum schedule, and if granted during the months of April, May, or June, one-fourth of the maximum schedule.\n\n4. Refunds.\n\na. An unrevoked permit for which the holder has paid the full annual fee may be surrendered during the first nine months of said year to the officer issuing it, and the department, or the city or county granting the permit shall make refunds to the holder as follows:\n\n(1) Three-fourths of the annual fee if the surrender is made during July, August, or September.\n\n(2) One-half of the annual fee if the surrender is made during October, November, or December.\n\n(3) One-fourth of the annual fee if the surrender is made during January, February, or March.\n\nb.

Application — bond. Permits shall be issued only upon applications accompanied by the fee indicated above, and by an adequate bond as provided in section 453A.14, and upon forms furnished by the department upon written request. The failure to furnish such forms shall be no excuse for the failure to file the forms unless absolute refusal is shown. The forms shall set forth all of the following:\n\na. The manner under which the distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, transacts or intends to transact such business as a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer.\n\nb. The principal office, residence, and place of business where the permit is to apply.\n\nc. If the applicant is not an individual, the principal officers or members and their addresses.\n\nd. Any other information as the director shall by rules prescribe.\n\n6. No sales without permit. A distributor, wholesaler, cigarette vendor, or retailer shall not sell any cigarettes, alternative nicotine products, or vapor products until such application has been filed and the fee prescribed paid for a permit and until such permit is obtained and only while such permit is unrevoked and unexpired.\n\n7. Number of permits — trucks. An application shall be filed and a permit obtained for each place of business owned or operated by a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, excepting that no permit need be obtained for a delivery or sales truck of a distributor or wholesaler holding a permit, provided that the director may by regulation require that said truck bear the distributor’s or wholesaler’s name, and that the permit number of the place of business for and from which it operates be conspicuously displayed on the outside of the body of the truck, immediately under the name.\n\n8. Group business. Any person who operates both as a distributor and wholesaler in the same place of business shall only be required to obtain a state permit for the particular place of business where such operation of said business is conducted. A separate retail permit, however, shall be required if any distributor or wholesaler sells cigarettes at both retail and wholesale.\n\n9. Permit — form and contents. Each permit issued shall describe clearly the place of business for which it is issued, shall be nonassignable, consecutively numbered, designating the kind of permit, and shall authorize the sale of cigarettes, alternative nicotine products, or vapor products in this state subject to the limitations and restrictions herein contained. The retail permits shall be upon forms furnished by the department or on forms made available or approved by the department.\n\n10. Permit displayed. The permit shall, at all times, be publicly displayed by the distributor, wholesaler, or retailer at the place of business so as to be easily seen by the public and the persons authorized to inspect the place of business. The proprietor or keeper of any building or place where cigarettes, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or tobacco products are kept for sale, or with intent to sell, shall upon request of any agent of the department or any peace officer exhibit the permit. A refusal or failure to exhibit the permit is prima facie evidence that the cigarettes, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, tobacco, or tobacco products are kept for sale or with intent to sell in violation of this subchapter.\n\n[S13, §5007-a; C24, 27, §1557, 1558, 1560, 1563, 1564, 1584; C31, 35, §1557, 1558, 1560, 1563, 1563-d1, 1564, 1584; C39, §1556.08; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §98.13]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1007, §5; 86 Acts, ch 1241, §1\n\nC93, §453A.13\n\n94 Acts, ch 1165, §38; 2000 Acts, ch 1105, §5; 2007 Acts, ch 186, §34, 35; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §48; 2011 Acts, ch 63, §14; 2012 Acts, ch 1023, §54, 55; 2014 Acts, ch 1109, §6, 7; 2017 Acts, ch 170, §63, 64; 2017 Acts, ch 171, §60; 2018 Acts, ch 1041, §126, 127; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1154, 2463\n\nReferred to in §421.26, 453A.36, 453A.40, 453A.47C\n\nSee Code editor’s note on simple harmonization at the beginning of this Code volume\n\nSubsection 2, paragraph c amended",

A proceeding in the nature of a proceeding in rem shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of seizure to maintain the seizure and declare and perfect the forfeiture. All cigarettes, counterfeit cigarettes, vehicles, and property seized, remaining in the possession or custody of the department, sheriff or other officer for forfeiture or other disposition as provided by law, are not subject to replevin.\n\n2.

The county attorney of the county of seizure, shall, at the request of the director, file in the county and court aforesaid forfeiture proceeding in the name of the state as plaintiff, and in the name of the owner or person in possession as defendant, if known, and if unknown, then in the name of said property seized and sought to be forfeited. Upon the filing of said proceeding, the clerk of said court shall issue notice to the owner or person in possession of such property to appear before such court upon the date named therein, which shall not be less than two days from service of such notice, to show cause why the forfeiture aforesaid should not be declared, which notice shall be served by the sheriff of said county. In the event the defendant in said proceeding is a nonresident of the state or the defendant’s residence is unknown, or in the event the name of such defendant is unknown, upon affidavit by the director to this effect, notice shall be given as ordered by the court.\n\n4. In the event final judgment is rendered in the forfeiture proceedings aforesaid, maintaining the seizure, and declaring and perfecting the forfeiture of said seized property, the court shall order and decree the sale of the seized property, other than the counterfeit cigarettes, to the highest bidder, by the sheriff at public auction in the county of seizure after notice is given in the manner provided in the case of the sale of personal property under execution, and the proceeds of such sale, less expense of seizure and court costs, shall be paid into the state treasury.

No person, other than a common carrier and a distributor’s truck bearing the distributor’s name and permit number in plain view on the outside of such truck, shall transport within this state cigarettes upon which a tax is required to be paid, without having stamps affixed to each individual package of said cigarettes; and no person shall fail or refuse, upon demand of agent of the department, or any peace officer to stop any vehicle transporting cigarettes for a full and complete inspection of the cargo carried.\n\n3.
