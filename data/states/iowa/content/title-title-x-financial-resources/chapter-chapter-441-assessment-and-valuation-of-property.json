Devote full time to the duties of the assessor’s office and shall not engage in any occupation or business interfering or inconsistent with such duties. This subsection does not preclude an assessor from being a candidate for elective office during the term of appointment as assessor. If an assessor is elected to a city or county office, to a statewide elective office, or to the general assembly, the assessor shall resign as assessor before the beginning of the term of the office to which the assessor was elected.\n\n2. Cause to be assessed, in accordance with section 441.21, all the property in the assessor’s county or city, except property exempt from taxation, or the assessment of which is otherwise provided for by law. However, an assessor or deputy assessor shall not personally assess a property if the person owns the property, has a financial interest in the property, or has a financial interest in the entity that owns the property. The director of revenue shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to implement and administer this subsection.\n\n3. Have access to all public records of the county and, so far as practicable, make or cause to be made a careful examination of all such records and files in order to obtain all available information which may contribute to the accurate listing at its taxable value, and to the proper persons, of all property subject to assessment by the assessor.\n\n4. Cooperate with the director of revenue as may be necessary or required, and obey and execute all orders, directions, and instructions of the director of revenue, insofar as the same may be required by law.\n\n5. a. Have power to apply to the district court of the county for an order to examine witnesses and requiring the production of books and records of any person, firm, association or corporation within the county, whenever the assessor has reason to believe that such person, firm, association or corporation has not listed property as provided by law. The proceeding for the examination of witnesses and examination of the books and records of any such taxpayer, to determine the existence of taxable property, shall be instituted and conducted in the manner provided for the discovery of property under the provisions of chapter 630. The court shall make an appropriate finding as to the existence of taxable property not listed. All taxable property discovered thereby shall thereupon be assessed by the assessor in the manner provided by law.\n\nb. In all cases where the court finds that the taxpayer has not listed the taxpayer’s property, as provided by law, and in all hearings where the court decides a matter against the taxpayer, the costs shall be paid by the taxpayer, otherwise they shall be paid out of the assessment expense fund. The fees and mileage to be paid witnesses shall be the same as prescribed by law in proceedings in the district courts of this state in civil cases. Where the costs are taxed to the taxpayer they shall be added to the taxes assessed against said taxpayer and the taxpayer’s property and shall be collected in the same manner as are other taxes.\n\n6. Make up all assessor’s books and records as prescribed by the director of revenue, turn the completed assessor’s books and records required for the preparation of the tax list over to the county auditor each year when the board of review has concluded its hearings and the county auditor shall proceed with the preparation of the current year tax list and the assessor shall cooperate with the auditor in the preparation of the tax lists.\n\n7. Submit on or before May 1 of each year completed assessment rolls to the board of review.\n\n8. Lay before the board of review such information as the assessor may possess which will aid said board in performing its duties in adjusting the assessments to the valuations required by law.\n\n9. Furnish to the department of revenue any information which the assessor may have relative to the ownership of any property that may be assessable within this state, but not assessable or subject to being listed for taxation by the assessor.\n\n10. Measure the exterior length and exterior width of all mobile homes and manufactured homes except those for which measurements are contained in the manufacturer’s and importer’s certificate of origin, and report the information to the county treasurer. Check all manufactured or mobile homes for inaccuracy of measurements as necessary or upon written request of the county treasurer and report the findings immediately to the county treasurer. The assessor shall make frequent inspections and checks within the assessor jurisdiction of all manufactured or mobile homes and manufactured home communities or mobile home parks and make all the required and needed reports to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n11. Cause to be assessed for taxation property which the assessor believes has been erroneously exempted from taxation.

Supplemental and optional to the procedure for the assessment of property by the assessor as provided in this chapter, the assessor may require from all persons required to list their property for taxation as provided by sections 428.1 and 428.2, a supplemental return to be prescribed by the director of revenue upon which the person shall list the person’s property. The supplemental return shall be in substantially the same form as now prescribed by law for the assessment rolls used in the listing of property by the assessors. However, for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and unless otherwise required for property valued by the department of revenue pursuant to chapters 428, 433, 437, and 438, a supplemental return shall not request, and a person shall not be otherwise required to provide to the assessor for property assessment purposes, sales or receipts data, expense data, balance sheets, bank account information, or other data related to the financial condition of a business operating in whole or in part on the property if the property is both classified as commercial or industrial property and owned and used by the owner of the business. Every person required to list property for taxation shall make a complete listing of the property upon supplemental forms and return the listing to the assessor as promptly as possible. The return shall be verified over the signature of the person making the return and section 441.25 applies to any person making such a return. The assessor shall make supplemental return forms available as soon as practicable after the first day of January of each year. The assessor shall make supplemental return forms available to the taxpayer by mail, or at a designated place within the taxing district.\n\nb. Upon receipt of such supplemental return from any person the assessor shall prepare a roll assessing the person. In the preparation of such assessment roll the assessor shall be guided not only by the information contained in such supplemental roll, but by any other information the assessor may have or which may be obtained by the assessor as prescribed by the law relating to the assessment of property. The assessor shall not be bound by any values as listed in such supplemental return, and may include in the assessment roll any property omitted from the supplemental return which in the knowledge and belief of the assessor should be listed as required by law by the person making the supplemental return.

Any taxpayer aggrieved by the action of the assessor in the preparation of an assessment roll upon which a supplemental return has been made shall have the same rights and privileges of appeal as provided by law in connection with the assessment rolls prepared in entirety by the assessor, but no assessment rolls prepared by the assessor after receiving a supplemental return shall be deemed insufficient or invalid because of the fact that such assessment roll does not bear the signature of the person assessed, and the signature of the person listing property upon the supplemental return shall be deemed a signature on the roll as prepared by the assessor.\n\nd. The supplemental returns provided for in this section shall be preserved in the same manner as assessment rolls, but shall be confidential to the assessor, board of review, property assessment appeal board, or director of revenue, and shall not be open to public inspection, but any final assessment roll as made out by the assessor shall be a public record, provided that such supplemental return shall be available to counsel of either the person making the return or of the public, in case any appeal is taken to the board of review, to the property assessment appeal board, or to the court.\n\ne. In the event of a failure of any person required to list property to make a supplemental return on or before the fifteenth day of February of any year when the listing is required, the assessor shall proceed in the listing and assessment of the person’s property as provided by this chapter. A failure to make a supplemental return does not relieve a person subject to taxation of the person’s obligation to list the person’s property and any roll prepared by the assessor after receiving a supplemental return, or when prepared in accordance with other provisions of this chapter, shall be a valid assessment.\n\nf. The provisions of this chapter relating to assessment rolls shall be applicable to the preparation of rolls upon which a supplemental return has been received, insofar as they are not in conflict with the provision of this section.\n\n2.

A report containing an itemized list of machinery by year of acquisition and by acquisition cost shall be required only when deemed necessary by the assessor. The reports shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the director of revenue or on forms submitted by the taxpayer and approved by the assessor which forms shall contain the same information as is required to be reported on forms prescribed by the director. If a person shall knowingly enter false information on the report, the person shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor.

All property subject to taxation shall be valued at its actual value which shall be entered opposite each item, and, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall be assessed at one hundred percent of its actual value, and the value so assessed shall be taken and considered as the assessed value and taxable value of the property upon which the levy shall be made.\n\nb. (1) The actual value of all property subject to assessment and taxation shall be the fair and reasonable market value of such property except as otherwise provided in this section. “Market value” is defined as the fair and reasonable exchange in the year in which the property is listed and valued between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and each being familiar with all the facts relating to the particular property. Sale prices of the property or comparable property in normal transactions reflecting market value, and the probable availability or unavailability of persons interested in purchasing the property, shall be taken into consideration in arriving at its market value. In arriving at market value, sale prices of property in abnormal transactions not reflecting market value shall not be taken into account, or shall be adjusted to eliminate the effect of factors which distort market value, including but not limited to sales to immediate family of the seller, foreclosure or other forced sales, contract sales, discounted purchase transactions or purchase of adjoining land or other land to be operated as a unit.\n\n(2) The actual value of special purpose tooling, which is subject to assessment and taxation as real property under section 427A.1, subsection 1, paragraph “e”, but which can be used only to manufacture property which is protected by one or more United States or foreign patents, shall not exceed the fair and reasonable exchange value between a willing buyer and a willing seller, assuming that the willing buyer is purchasing only the special purpose tooling and not the patent covering the property which the special purpose tooling is designed to manufacture nor the rights to manufacture the patented property. For purposes of this subparagraph, special purpose tooling includes dies, jigs, fixtures, molds, patterns, and similar property. The assessor shall not take into consideration the special value or use value to the present owner of the special purpose tooling which is designed and intended solely for the manufacture of property protected by a patent in arriving at the actual value of the special purpose tooling.\n\nc. In assessing and determining the actual value of special purpose industrial property having an actual value of five million dollars or more, the assessor shall equalize the values of such property with the actual values of other comparable special purpose industrial property in other counties of the state. Such special purpose industrial property includes, but is not limited to chemical plants. If a variation of ten percent or more exists between the actual values of comparable industrial property having an actual value of five million dollars or more located in separate counties, the assessors of the counties shall consult with each other and with the department of revenue to determine if adequate reasons exist for the variation. If no adequate reasons exist, the assessors shall make adjustments in the actual values to provide for a variation of ten percent or less. For the purposes of this paragraph, special purpose industrial property includes structures which are designed and erected for operation of a unique and special use, are not rentable in existing condition, and are incapable of conversion to ordinary commercial or industrial use except at a substantial cost.\n\nd. Actual value of property in one assessing jurisdiction shall be equalized as compared with actual value of property in an adjoining assessing jurisdiction. If a variation of five percent or more exists between the actual values of similar, closely adjacent property in adjoining assessing jurisdictions in Iowa, the assessors thereof shall determine whether adequate reasons exist for such variation. If no such reasons exist, the assessors shall make adjustments in such actual values to reduce the variation to five percent or less.\n\ne. The actual value of agricultural property shall be determined on the basis of productivity and net earning capacity of the property determined on the basis of its use for agricultural purposes capitalized at a rate of seven percent and applied uniformly among counties and among classes of property. Any formula or method employed to determine productivity and net earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule.\n\nf. In counties or townships in which field work on a modern soil survey has been completed since January 1, 1949, the assessor shall place emphasis upon the results of the survey in spreading the valuation among individual parcels of such agricultural property.\n\ng. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the actual value of any property shall not exceed its fair and reasonable market value, except agricultural property which shall be valued exclusively as provided in paragraph “e” of this subsection.\n\nh. The assessor shall determine the value of real property in accordance with rules adopted by the department of revenue and in accordance with forms and guidelines contained in the real property appraisal manual prepared by the department as updated from time to time. Such rules, forms, and guidelines shall not be inconsistent with or change the means, as provided in this section, of determining the actual, market, taxable, and assessed values.\n\ni. (1) If the department finds that a city or county assessor is not in compliance with the rules of the department relating to valuation of property or has disregarded the forms and guidelines contained in the real property appraisal manual, the department shall notify the assessor and each member of the conference board for the appropriate assessing jurisdiction. The notice shall be mailed by restricted certified mail. The notice shall specify the areas of noncompliance and the steps necessary to achieve compliance. The notice shall also inform the assessor and conference board that if compliance is not achieved, a penalty may be imposed.\n\n(2) The conference board shall respond to the department within thirty days of receipt of the notice of noncompliance. The conference board may respond to the notice by asserting that the assessor is in compliance with the rules, guidelines, and forms of the department or by informing the department that the conference board intends to submit a plan of action to achieve compliance. If the conference board responds to the notification by asserting that the assessor is in compliance, a hearing before the director of revenue shall be scheduled on the matter. Judicial review of the decision of the director of revenue may be sought by the conference board in accordance with chapter 17A.\n\n(3) A plan of action shall be submitted within sixty days of receipt of the notice of noncompliance. The plan shall contain a time frame under which compliance shall be achieved which shall be no later than January 1 of the following assessment year. The plan of action shall contain the signature of the assessor and of the chairperson of the conference board. The department shall review the plan to determine whether the plan is sufficient to achieve compliance. Within thirty days of receipt of the plan, the department shall notify the assessor and the chairperson of the conference board that it has accepted the plan or that it is necessary to submit an amended plan of action.\n\n(4) By January 1 of the assessment year following the calendar year in which the plan was submitted to the department, the conference board shall submit a report to the department indicating that the plan of action was followed and compliance has been achieved. The department may conduct a field inspection to ensure that the assessor is in compliance. By January 31, the department shall notify the assessor and the conference board, by restricted certified mail, either that compliance has been achieved or that the assessor remains in noncompliance. If the department determines that the assessor remains in noncompliance, the department shall take steps to withhold up to five percent of the reimbursement payment authorized in section 425.1 until the department of revenue determines that the assessor is in compliance.\n\n(5) If the conference board disputes the determination of the department, the chairperson of the conference board may appeal the determination to the director of revenue within thirty days from the date of the notice that the assessor remains in noncompliance. The director of revenue shall grant a hearing, and upon hearing shall determine the correctness of the department’s determination of noncompliance. The director of revenue shall notify the conference board of the decision by mail. Judicial review of the decision of the director of revenue may be sought by the chairperson of the conference board in accordance with chapter 17A.\n\n(6) The department shall adopt rules relating to the administration of this paragraph “i”.\n\n2. In the event market value of the property being assessed cannot be readily established in the foregoing manner, then the assessor may determine the value of the property using the other uniform and recognized appraisal methods including its productive and earning capacity, if any, industrial conditions, its cost, physical and functional depreciation and obsolescence and replacement cost, and all other factors which would assist in determining the fair and reasonable market value of the property but the actual value shall not be determined by use of only one such factor. The following shall not be taken into consideration: Special value or use value of the property to its present owner, and the goodwill or value of a business which uses the property as distinguished from the value of the property as property. In addition, for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and unless otherwise required for property valued by the department of revenue pursuant to chapters 428, 433, 437, and 438, the assessor shall not take into consideration and shall not request from any person sales or receipts data, expense data, balance sheets, bank account information, or other data related to the financial condition of a business operating in whole or in part on the property if the property is both classified as commercial or industrial property and owned and used by the owner of the business. However, in assessing property that is rented or leased to low-income individuals and families as authorized by section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and which section limits the amount that the individual or family pays for the rental or lease of units in the property, the assessor shall, unless the owner elects to withdraw the property from the assessment procedures for section 42 property, use the productive and earning capacity from the actual rents received as a method of appraisal and shall take into account the extent to which that use and limitation reduces the market value of the property. The assessor shall not consider any tax credit equity or other subsidized financing as income provided to the property in determining the assessed value. The property owner shall notify the assessor when property is withdrawn from section 42 eligibility under the Internal Revenue Code or if the owner elects to withdraw the property from the assessment procedures for section 42 property under this subsection. The property shall not be subject to section 42 assessment procedures for the assessment year for which section 42 eligibility is withdrawn or an election is made. This notification must be provided to the assessor no later than March 1 of the assessment year or the owner will be subject to a penalty of five hundred dollars for that assessment year. The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as regular property taxes. An election to withdraw from the assessment procedures for section 42 property is irrevocable. Property that is withdrawn from the assessment procedures for section 42 property shall be classified and assessed as residential property unless the property otherwise fails to meet the requirements of subsection 14. Upon adoption of uniform rules by the department of revenue or succeeding authority covering assessments and valuations of such properties, the valuation on such properties shall be determined in accordance with such rules and in accordance with forms and guidelines contained in the real property appraisal manual prepared by the department as updated from time to time for assessment purposes to assure uniformity, but such rules, forms, and guidelines shall not be inconsistent with or change the foregoing means of determining the actual, market, taxable and assessed values.\n\n3. a. “Actual value”, “taxable value”, or “assessed value” as used in other sections of the Code in relation to assessment of property for taxation shall mean the valuations as determined by this section; however, other provisions of the Code providing special methods or formulas for assessing or valuing specified property shall remain in effect, but this section shall be applicable to the extent consistent with such provisions. The assessor and department of revenue shall disclose at the written request of the taxpayer all information in any formula or method used to determine the actual value of the taxpayer’s property.\n\nb. (1) For assessment years beginning before January 1, 2018, the burden of proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However, in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses that the market value of the property is less than the market value determined by the assessor, the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.\n\n(2) For assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the burden of proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However, in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers competent evidence that the market value of the property is different than the market value determined by the assessor, the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.\n\n(3) If the classification of a property has been previously adjudicated by the property assessment appeal board or a court as part of an appeal under this chapter, there is a presumption that the classification of the property has not changed for each of the four subsequent assessment years, unless a subsequent such adjudication of the classification of the property has occurred, and the burden of demonstrating a change in use shall be upon the person asserting a change to the property’s classification.\n\n4. For valuations established as of January 1, 1979, the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section.\n\na. (1) The dividend for each class of property shall be the dividend as determined for each class of property for valuations established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 1978, plus six percent of the amount so determined.\n\n(2) However, if the difference between the dividend so determined for either class of property and the dividend for that class of property for valuations established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 1978, is less than six percent, the 1979 dividend for the other class of property shall be the dividend as determined for that class of property for valuations established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 1978, plus a percentage of the amount so determined which is equal to the percentage by which the dividend as determined for the other class of property for valuations established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for the other class of property.\n\n(3) For valuations established for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the calculation of the dividend for residential property under this subsection shall exclude the value of all property described in subsection 14, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), and the property described in subsection 14, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (7), that contains three or more separate dwelling units.\n\nb. (1) The divisor for each class of property shall be the total actual value of all such property in the state in the preceding year, as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978, plus the amount of value added to said total actual value by the revaluation of existing properties in 1979 as equalized by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49. The director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining such percentage.\n\n(2) For valuations established for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the calculation of the divisor for residential property under this subsection shall exclude the value of all property described in subsection 14, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), and the property described in subsection 14, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (7), that contains three or more separate dwelling units.\n\nc.

For valuations established as of January 1, 1979, property valued by the department of revenue pursuant to chapters 428, 433, 437, and 438 shall be considered as one class of property and shall be assessed as a percentage of its actual value. The percentage shall be determined by the director of revenue in accordance with the provisions of this section. For valuations established as of January 1, 1979, the percentage shall be the quotient of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section. The dividend shall be the total actual valuation established for 1978 by the department of revenue, plus ten percent of the amount so determined. The divisor for property valued by the department of revenue pursuant to chapters 428, 433, 437, and 438 shall be the valuation established for 1978, plus the amount of value added to the total actual value by the revaluation of the property by the department of revenue as of January 1, 1979.

Of the amounts allocated and credited to each property tax levy that is subject to division under section 403.19, the total amount paid into the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for the taxing authority into which all other property taxes are paid and the special fund of the applicable municipality under section 403.19, subsection 2, shall be an amount of the replacement claim that is proportionate to the amount of the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable commercial and industrial property in the urban renewal area as a share of total assessed value of all taxable property in the taxing authority and shall be apportioned as follows:\n\n(1) To the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for the taxing authority into which all other property taxes are paid, an amount proportionate to the amount of actual value of the commercial and industrial property in the urban renewal area as determined in section 403.19, subsection 1, that was subtracted pursuant to section 403.20, as it bears to the total amount of actual value of the commercial and industrial property in the urban renewal area that was subtracted pursuant to section 403.20 for the assessment year for property taxes due and payable in the fiscal year for which the replacement claim is computed.\n\n(2) (a) To the special fund of the applicable municipality under section 403.19, subsection 2, the remaining amount, if any.\n\n(b) The amount allocated under subparagraph division (a) shall not exceed the amount equal to the amount certified to the county auditor under section 403.19 for the fiscal year in which the claim is paid, after deduction of the amount of other revenues committed for payment on that amount for the fiscal year.

(1) Any property owner or aggrieved taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the owner’s or taxpayer’s assessment may file a protest against such assessment with the board of review on or after April 2, to and including April 30, of the year of the assessment. In any county which has been declared to be a disaster area by proper federal authorities or that is the subject of a state of disaster emergency proclamation by the governor after March 1 and prior to May 20 of said year of assessment, the board of review shall be authorized to remain in session until July 15 and the time for filing a protest shall be extended to and include the period from May 1 to June 5 of such year. The protest shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the director of revenue and, except as provided in subsection 3, signed by the one protesting or by the protester’s duly authorized agent. The taxpayer may have an oral hearing on the protest if the request for the oral hearing is made in writing at the time of filing the protest. The protest must be confined to one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) That said assessment is not equitable as compared with assessments of other like property in the taxing district.\n\n(b) That the property is assessed for more than the value authorized by law.\n\n(c) That the property is not assessable, is exempt from taxes, or is misclassified.\n\n(d) That there is an error in the assessment.\n\n(e) That there is fraud or misconduct in the assessment which shall be specifically stated.\n\n(2) If the local board of review, property assessment appeal board, or district court decides in favor of the property owner or aggrieved taxpayer and finds that there was fraud or misconduct in the assessment, the property owner’s or aggrieved taxpayer’s reasonable costs incurred in bringing the protest or appeal shall be paid from the assessment expense fund under section 441.16.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, “costs” include but are not limited to legal fees, appraisal fees, and witness fees.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, “misconduct” means the same as defined in section 441.9.\n\nb. The burden of proof for all protests filed under this section shall be as stated in section 441.21, subsection 3.\n\nc. The property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may combine on one form protests of assessment on parcels separately assessed if the same grounds are relied upon as the basis for protesting each separate assessment. If an oral hearing is requested on more than one of such protests, the person making the combined protests may request that the oral hearings be held consecutively.\n\n2. a. A property owner or aggrieved taxpayer who finds that a clerical or mathematical error has been made in the assessment of the owner’s or taxpayer’s property may file a protest against that assessment in the same manner as provided in this section, except that the protest may be filed for previous years. The board may correct clerical or mathematical errors for any assessment year in which the taxes have not been fully paid or otherwise legally discharged.\n\nb. Upon the determination of the board that a clerical or mathematical error has been made the board shall take appropriate action to correct the error and notify the county auditor of the change in the assessment as a result of the error and the county auditor shall make the correction in the assessment and the tax list in the same manner as provided in section 443.6.\n\nc. The board shall not correct an error resulting from a property owner’s or taxpayer’s inaccuracy in reporting or failure to comply with section 441.19.\n\n3. For assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, the board of review may allow property owners or aggrieved taxpayers who are dissatisfied with the owner’s or taxpayer’s assessment to file a protest against such assessment by electronic means. Electronic filing of assessment protests may be authorized for the protest period that begins April 2, the protest period that begins October 9, or both. Except for the requirement that a protest be signed, all other requirements of this section for an assessment protest to the board of review shall apply to a protest filed electronically. If electronic filing is authorized by the local board of review, the availability of electronic filing shall be clearly indicated on the assessment roll notice provided to the property owner or taxpayer and included in both the published equalization order notice and the equalization order notice mailed to the property owner or taxpayer if applicable.\n\n4. After the board of review has considered any protest filed by a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer and made final disposition of the protest, the board shall give written notice to the property owner or aggrieved taxpayer who filed the protest of the action taken by the board of review on the protest. The written notice to the property owner or aggrieved taxpayer shall also specify the reasons for the action taken by the board of review on the protest. If protests of assessment on multiple parcels separately assessed were combined, the written notice shall state the action taken, and the reasons for the action, for each assessment protested.\n\n[R60, §740; C73, §831; C97, §1373; S13, §1373; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §7132; C46, 50, 54, 58, §405.22, 442.5; C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, S81, §441.37; 81 Acts, ch 145, §2]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1028, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1251, §2; 2005 Acts, ch 140, §57, 58, 73; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2013 Acts, ch 123, §56, 57, 64, 65; 2015 Acts, ch 116, §9, 10, 13; 2017 Acts, ch 151, §11 – 13, 29; 2019 Acts, ch 59, §133; 2023 Acts, ch 129, §2\n\nReferred to in §404.5, 404B.6, 428.4, 441.26, 441.30, 441.33, 441.37A, 441.38, 441.45\n\nSubsection 1, paragraph a, subparagraph (1), unnumbered paragraph 1 amended",

Appeals may be taken from the action of the board of review with reference to protests of assessment, valuation, or application of an equalization order to the property assessment appeal board created in section 421.1A. However, a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer or an appellant described in section 441.42 may bypass the property assessment appeal board and appeal the decision of the local board of review to the district court pursuant to section 441.38.\n\nb. For an appeal to the property assessment appeal board to be valid, a party must file an appeal with the board within twenty days after the date of adjournment of the local board of review or May 31, whichever is later. The appeal shall include the basis of the appeal and the relief sought. New grounds in addition to those set out in the protest to the local board of review, as provided in section 441.37, may be pleaded, and additional evidence to sustain those grounds set out in the protest to the local board of review may be introduced. The assessor shall have the same right to appeal to the assessment appeal board as an individual taxpayer, public body, or other public officer as provided in section 441.42. An appeal to the board is a contested case under chapter 17A.\n\nc. Filing of the appeal with the property assessment appeal board shall preserve all rights of appeal of the appellant, except as otherwise provided in subsection 2.\n\nd. A copy of the appellant’s appeal shall be sent by the property assessment appeal board to the local board of review whose decision is being appealed.\n\ne. The property assessment appeal board may, by rule, provide for the filing of an appeal by electronic means. All requirements of this section for an appeal to the board shall apply to an appeal filed electronically.\n\n2. a. A party to the appeal may request a hearing or the appeal may proceed without a hearing. If a hearing is requested, the appellant and the local board of review from which the appeal is taken shall be given at least thirty days’ written notice by the property assessment appeal board of the date the appeal shall be heard and the local board of review may be present and participate at such hearing. Notice to all affected taxing districts shall be deemed to have been given when written notice is provided to the local board of review. The requirement of thirty days’ written notice may be waived by mutual agreement of all parties to the appeal. Failure by the appellant to appear at the property assessment appeal board hearing shall result in dismissal of the appeal unless a continuance is granted to the appellant by the board following a showing of good cause for the appellant’s failure to appear. If an appeal is dismissed for failure to appear, the property assessment appeal board shall have no jurisdiction to consider any subsequent appeal on the appellant’s protest.\n\nb. Each appeal may be considered by one or more members of the board, and the chairperson of the board may assign members to consider appeals. If a hearing is requested, it shall be open to the public and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure adopted by the board. The board may provide by rule for participation in such hearings by telephone or other means of electronic communication. However, any deliberation of the board or of board members considering the appeal in reaching a decision on any appeal shall be confidential. Any deliberation of the board or of board members to rule on procedural motions in a pending appeal or to deliberate on the decision to be reached in an appeal is exempt from the provisions of chapter 21. The property assessment appeal board or any member of the board considering the appeal may require the production of any books, records, papers, or documents as evidence in any matter pending before the board that may be material, relevant, or necessary for the making of a just decision. Any books, records, papers, or documents produced as evidence shall become part of the record of the appeal. Any testimony given relating to the appeal shall be electronically recorded and made a part of the record of the appeal.\n\n3. a. The burden of proof for all appeals before the board shall be as stated in section 441.21, subsection 3. The board members considering the appeal shall determine anew all questions arising before the local board of review that relate to the liability of the property to assessment or the amount of the assessment. All of the evidence shall be considered and there shall be no presumption as to the correctness of the valuation of assessment appealed from. If the appeal is considered by less than the full membership of the board, the determination made by such members shall be forwarded to the full board for approval, rejection, or modification. If the initial determination is rejected by the board, it shall be returned for reconsideration to the board members making the initial determination.\n\nb. The decision of the board shall be considered the final agency action and is subject to judicial review as provided in section 441.37B, except as otherwise provided in section 441.49. A decision of the board modifying an assessment shall be sent to the county auditor and the assessor, who shall correct the assessment books accordingly. An appeal of the board’s decision under section 441.37B shall not itself stay execution or enforcement of the board’s decision.\n\nc. The levy of taxes on any assessment appealed to the board shall not be delayed by any proceeding before the board, and if the assessment appealed from is reduced by the decision of the board, any taxes levied upon that portion of the assessment reduced shall be abated or, if already paid, shall, by order of the board, be refunded or credited against future property taxes levied against the property at the option of the property owner or aggrieved taxpayer.\n\nd. If the subject of an appeal is the application of an equalization order, the property assessment appeal board shall not order a reduction in assessment greater than the amount that the assessment was increased due to application of the equalization order.\n\ne.

However, an assessing jurisdiction may request the department to permit the use of an alternative method of applying the equalization order to the property values in the assessing jurisdiction, provided that the final valuation shall be equivalent to the department’s equalization order. The assessing jurisdiction shall notify the county auditor of the request for the use of an alternative method of applying the equalization order and the department’s disposition of the request. The request to use an alternative method of applying the equalization order, including procedures for notifying affected property owners and appealing valuation adjustments, shall be made within ten days from the date the county auditor receives the equalization order and the valuation adjustments, and appeal procedures shall be completed by November 30 of the year of the equalization order. Compliance with the provisions of section 441.21 is sufficient grounds for the department to permit the use of an alternative method of applying the equalization order.\n\n2. a. On or before October 8 the county auditor shall cause to be published in official newspapers of general circulation the final equalization order. The county auditor shall also notify each property owner or taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the final equalization order by mail postmarked on or before October 8. The publication and the individual notice mailed to each property owner or taxpayer whose valuation has been increased shall include, in type larger than the remainder of the publication or notice, the following statements:\n\nAssessed values are equalized by the department of revenue every two years. Local taxing authorities determine the final tax levies and may reduce property tax rates to compensate for any increase in valuation due to equalization. If you are not satisfied that your assessment as adjusted by the equalization order is correct, you may file a protest against such assessment with the board of review on or after October 9, to and including October 31.\n\nb. Failure to publish the equalization order or to notify property owners or taxpayers of the equalization order has no effect upon the validity of the orders.\n\n3. The county auditor shall add to or deduct from the valuation of each class of property in the county the required percentage, rejecting all fractions of fifty cents or less in the result, and counting all fractions over fifty cents as one dollar. For any special charter city that levies and collects its own tax based on current year assessed values, the equalization percentage shall be applied to the following year’s values, and shall be considered the equalized values for that year for purposes of this chapter.\n\n4. The local board of review shall reconvene in special session from October 10 to November 15 for the purpose of hearing the protests of affected property owners or taxpayers within the jurisdiction of the board whose valuation of property if adjusted pursuant to the equalization order issued by the department of revenue will result in a greater value than permitted under section 441.21. The board of review shall accept protests only during the period of time from October 9, to and including October 31. The board of review shall limit its review to only the timely filed protests. The board of review may adjust all or a part of the percentage increase ordered by the department of revenue by adjusting the actual value of the property under protest to one hundred percent of actual value. Any adjustment so determined by the board of review shall not exceed the percentage increase provided for in the department’s equalization order. The determination of the board of review on filed protests is final, subject to appeal to the property assessment appeal board. A final decision by the local board of review, or the property assessment appeal board, if the local board’s decision is appealed, is subject to review by the director of revenue for the purpose of determining whether the board’s actions substantially altered the equalization order. In making the review, the director has all the powers provided in chapter 421, and in exercising the powers the director is not subject to chapter 17A.
