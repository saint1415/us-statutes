A taxpayer may make an election under this section only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\na. An election for federal estate tax purposes was made with regard to the qualified real property under section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nb. All persons who signed the agreement referred to in section 2032A(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code make the election under this section and sign an agreement with the department of revenue consenting to the application of section 450B.3 with respect to the qualified real property.\n\nc. The total decrease in the value of the qualified real property as a result of the election under this section does not exceed the dollar limitation specified in section 2032A(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n2. The election under this section shall be made by the taxpayer in the manner as the director of revenue may prescribe by rule.

Such regulations shall conform as nearly as possible with the regulations promulgated by the United States secretary of the treasury in respect to such interests.\n\n[81 Acts, ch 147, §13]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1028, §40; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143\n\nReferred to in §450B.3, 450B.5, 450B.6",

The amount of the additional inheritance tax shall accrue interest at the rate of ten percent per year from nine months after the decedent’s death to the due date of the tax. The tax shall be paid to the department of revenue and shall be deposited into the general fund of the state. Taxes not paid within the time prescribed in this section shall draw interest at the rate of ten percent per annum until paid.

The lien created by this section shall continue until the tax has been paid or ten years after the tax is due, whichever date occurs first. However, the lien shall expire ten years after the decedent’s death if the qualified heir has not disposed of or ceased to use for the qualified use the qualified real property which would impose the tax under section 450B.3. The department of revenue may release the lien prior to the payment of the tax due, if any, if adequate security for payment of the tax is given.\n\n2. Unless the lien has been perfected by recording in the office of the recorder in the county where the estate is probated, a transfer of the qualified real property to a bona fide purchaser for value shall divest the property of the lien. If the lien is perfected by recording, the rights of the state under the lien have priority over all subsequent mortgagees, purchasers, or judgment creditors.
