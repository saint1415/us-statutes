The owner of each mobile home or manufactured home located within a manufactured home community or mobile home park shall pay to the county treasurer an annual tax. However, when the owner is any educational institution and the home is used solely for student housing or when the owner is the state of Iowa or a subdivision of the state, the owner shall be exempt from the tax. The annual tax shall be computed as follows:\n\na. Multiply the number of square feet of floor space each home contains when parked and in use by twenty cents. In computing floor space, the exterior measurements of the home shall be used as shown on the certificate of title, but not including any area occupied by a hitching device.\n\nb. (1) If the owner of the home is an Iowa resident, has attained the age of twenty-three years on or before December 31 of the base year, and has an income when included with that of a spouse which is less than eight thousand five hundred dollars per year, the annual tax shall not be imposed on the home. If the income is eight thousand five hundred dollars or more but less than sixteen thousand five hundred dollars, the annual tax shall be computed as follows:\n\nIf the Household Annual Tax Per\n\nIncome is: Square Foot:\n\n$ 8,500 — 9,499.99 3.0 cents\n\n9,500 — 10,499.99 6.0\n\n10,500 — 12,499.99 10.0\n\n12,500 — 14,499.99 13.0\n\n14,500 — 16,499.99 15.0\n\n(2) For purposes of this paragraph “b”, “income” means income as defined in section 425.17, subsection 7, and “base year” means the calendar year preceding the year in which the claim for a reduced rate of tax is filed. The home reduced rate of tax shall only be allowed on the home in which the claimant is residing at the time the claim for a reduced rate of tax is filed or was residing at the time of the claimant’s death in the case of a claim filed on behalf of a deceased claimant by the claimant’s legal guardian, spouse, or attorney, or by the executor or administrator of the claimant’s estate.\n\n(3) Beginning with the 1998 base year, the income dollar amounts set forth in this paragraph “b” shall be multiplied by the cumulative adjustment factor for that base year as determined in section 425.23, subsection 4.\n\n2. The amount thus computed shall be the annual tax for all homes, except as follows:\n\na. For the sixth through ninth years after the year of manufacture the annual tax is ninety percent of the tax computed according to subsection 1, paragraph “a” or “b”, whichever is applicable.\n\nb. For all homes ten or more years after the year of manufacture the annual tax is eighty percent of the tax computed according to subsection 1, paragraph “a” or “b”, whichever is applicable.\n\n3. The tax shall be figured to the nearest even whole dollar.\n\n4. a. A claim for credit for manufactured or mobile home tax due shall not be paid or allowed unless the claim is actually filed with the county treasurer between January 1 and June 1, both dates inclusive, immediately preceding the fiscal year during which the home taxes are due. However, in case of sickness, absence, or other disability of the claimant, or if in the judgment of the county treasurer good cause exists, the county treasurer may extend the time for filing a claim for credit through March 31 of the fiscal year during which the home taxes are due. The county treasurer shall certify to the director of revenue on or before May 1 each year the total dollar amount due for claims allowed.\n\nb. The forms for filing the claim shall be provided by the department of revenue. The forms shall require information as determined by the department.\n\nc. In case of sickness, absence, or other disability of the claimant or if, in the judgment of the director of revenue, good cause exists and the claimant requests an extension, the director may extend the time for filing a claim for credit or reimbursement. However, any further time granted shall not extend beyond June 30 of the fiscal year in which the home taxes are due. Claims filed as a result of this paragraph shall be filed with the director who shall provide for the reimbursement of the claim to the claimant.\n\nd. The director of revenue shall certify the amount due to each county, which amount shall be the dollar amount which will not be collected due to the granting of the reduced tax rate under subsection 1, paragraph “b”.\n\ne. The amounts due each county shall be paid by the department of revenue on June 15 of each year, drawn upon warrants payable to the respective county treasurers. The county treasurer in each county shall apportion the payment in accordance with section 435.25.\n\nf.

      "text": "435.24 Collection of tax.\n\n1. The annual tax is due and payable to the county treasurer on or after July 1 in each fiscal year and is collectible in the same manner and at the same time as ordinary taxes as provided in sections 445.36, 445.37, and 445.39. Interest at the rate prescribed by law shall accrue on unpaid taxes. Both installments of taxes may be paid at one time. The September installment represents a tax period beginning July 1 and ending December 31. The March installment represents a tax period beginning January 1 and ending June 30. A mobile home, manufactured home, or modular home coming into this state from outside the state, put in use from a retailer’s inventory, or put in use at any time after July 1 or January 1, and located in a manufactured home community or mobile home park, is subject to the taxes prorated for the remaining unexpired months of the tax period, but the purchaser is not required to pay the tax at the time of purchase. Interest attaches the following April 1 for taxes prorated on or after October 1. Interest attaches the following October 1 for taxes prorated on or after April 1. If the taxes are not paid, the county treasurer shall send a statement of delinquent taxes as part of the notice of tax sale as provided in section 446.9. The owner of a home who sells the home between July 1 and December 31 and obtains a tax clearance statement is responsible only for the September tax payment and is not required to pay taxes for subsequent tax periods. If the owner of a home located in a manufactured home community or mobile home park sells the home, obtains a tax clearance statement, and obtains a replacement home to be located in a manufactured home community or mobile home park, the owner shall not pay taxes under this chapter for the newly acquired home for the same tax period that the owner has paid taxes on the home sold. Interest for delinquent taxes shall be calculated to the nearest whole dollar. In calculating interest each fraction of a month shall be counted as an entire month.\n\n2. The home owners upon issuance of a certificate of title or upon transporting to a new site shall file the address, township, and school district, of the location where the home is parked with the county treasurer’s office. Failure to comply is punishable as set out in section 435.18. When the new location is outside of a manufactured home community or mobile home park, the county treasurer shall provide to the assessor a copy of the tax clearance statement for purposes of assessment as real estate on the following January 1.\n\n3. Each manufactured home community or mobile home park owner shall notify monthly the county treasurer concerning any home arriving in or departing from the manufactured home community or park without a tax clearance statement. The records of the owner shall be open to inspection by a duly authorized representative of any law enforcement agency. The manufactured home community or mobile home park owner or manager shall make an annual report to the county treasurer due June 1 of the homes sited in the manufactured home community or mobile home park, listing the owner and mailing address of each home located in the manufactured home community or mobile home park. The report is delinquent if not filed with the county treasurer by June 30. In addition to the annual report, the owner or manager shall also report any changes of homes or owners in a report due December 1, which is delinquent if not filed by December 31. However, if no changes have occurred since the June annual report, the December report is not required to be filed.\n\n4. The tax is a lien on the vehicle senior to any other lien upon it except a judgment obtained in an action to dispose of an abandoned home under section 555B.8. The home bearing a current registration issued by any other state and remaining within this state for an accumulated period not to exceed ninety days in any twelve-month period is not subject to Iowa tax. However, when one or more persons occupying a home bearing a foreign registration are employed in this state, there is no exemption from the Iowa tax. This tax is in lieu of all other taxes general or local on a home.\n\n5. Before a home may be moved from its present site by any person, a tax clearance statement in the name of the owner must be obtained from the county treasurer of the county where the present site is located certifying that taxes are not owing under this section for previous years and that the taxes have been paid for the current tax period. When a person moves a home from real property to a retailer’s stock or to a manufactured home community or mobile home park, as defined in section 435.1, a tax clearance statement shall be applied for, and issued, from the county treasurer of the county where the present site is located. When the home is moved to another county in this state, the county treasurer shall forward a copy of the tax clearance statement to the county treasurer of the county in which the home is being relocated. However, a tax clearance statement is not required for a home in a manufacturer’s or retailer’s stock which has not been used as a place for human habitation. A tax clearance form is not required to move an abandoned home. A tax clearance form is not required in eviction cases provided the manufactured home community or mobile home park owner or manager advises the county treasurer that the tenant is being evicted. If a retailer acquires a home from a person other than a manufacturer, the person shall provide a tax clearance statement in the name of the owner of record to the retailer. The tax clearance statement shall be provided by the county treasurer in a method prescribed by the department of transportation.\n\n6. a. As an alternative to the semiannual or annual payment of taxes, the county treasurer may accept partial payments of current year home taxes. The treasurer shall transfer amounts from each taxpayer’s account to be applied to each semiannual tax installment prior to the delinquency dates specified in section 445.37 and the amounts collected shall be apportioned by the tenth of the month following transfer. If, prior to the due date of each semiannual installment, the account balance is insufficient to fully satisfy the installment, the treasurer shall transfer and apply the entire account balance, leaving an unpaid balance of the installment. Interest shall attach on the unpaid balance in accordance with section 445.39. Unless funds sufficient to fully satisfy the delinquency are received, the treasurer shall collect the unpaid balance as provided in sections 445.3 and 445.4 and chapter 446. Any remaining balance in a taxpayer’s account in excess of the amount needed to fully satisfy an installment shall remain in the account to be applied toward the next semiannual installment. Any interest income derived from the account shall be deposited in the county’s general fund to cover administrative costs. The treasurer shall send a notice with the tax statement or by separate mail to each taxpayer stating that, upon request to the treasurer, the taxpayer may make partial payments of current year home taxes.\n\nb. Partial payment of taxes which are delinquent may be made to the county treasurer. For the installment being paid, payment shall first be applied toward any interest, fees, and costs accrued and the remainder applied to the tax due. A partial payment must equal or exceed the interest, fees, and costs of the installment being paid. A partial payment made under this paragraph shall be apportioned in accordance with section 445.57, however, such partial payment may, at the discretion of the county treasurer, be apportioned either on or before the tenth day of the month following the receipt of the partial payment or on or before the tenth day of the month following the due date of the next semiannual tax installment. If the payment does not include the whole of any installment of the delinquent tax, the unpaid tax shall continue to accrue interest pursuant to section 445.39. Partial payment shall not be permitted in lieu of redemption if the property has been sold for taxes under chapter 446 and under any circumstances shall not constitute an extension of the time period for a sale under chapter 446.\n\n7. Current year taxes may be paid at any time regardless of any outstanding prior year delinquent taxes.\n\n[C66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §135D.24; 82 Acts, ch 1251, §2]\n\n83 Acts, ch 5, §1, 2, 4, 5; 85 Acts, ch 70, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1139, §1; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §1115; 87 Acts, ch 210, §3 – 5; 88 Acts, ch 1138, §11, 18; 90 Acts, ch 1080, §2; 91 Acts, ch 191, §2, 3; 92 Acts, ch 1016, §1\n\nC93, §435.24\n\n94 Acts, ch 1110, §11, 12, 24; 99 Acts, ch 83, §7; 2000 Acts, ch 1085, §5; 2001 Acts, ch 153, §16; 2005 Acts, ch 34, §11, 26; 2010 Acts, ch 1108, §12, 15; 2012 Acts, ch 1138, §103\n\nReferred to in §331.559, 331.653, 435.25, 435.27, 435.29, 445.5, 445.57",
