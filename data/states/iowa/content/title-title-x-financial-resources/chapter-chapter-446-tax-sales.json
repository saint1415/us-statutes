If a certificate holder fails to assign the certificate of purchase to the city or county, the county treasurer is authorized to issue a duplicate certificate of purchase, which shall take the place of the original certificate, and assign the duplicate certificate to the city or county. If the certificate is not assigned by the county or city pursuant to subsection 4, the county or city, whichever is applicable, is liable for the tax sale interest that was due the certificate holder pursuant to section 447.1, as of the date of assignment.\n\n4. a.

In the alternative, the county or city may, if title to the property has vested in the county or city under section 448.1, dispose of the property in accordance with section 331.361 or 364.7, as applicable.\n\n5.

The verified statement shall be published at the same time and in the same manner as the notice of the annual tax sale and the requirements in section 446.9, subsection 2, for publication of notice of the annual tax sale also apply to publication of the verified statement.\n\n4. On the day of the regular tax sale, or any continuance or adjournment of the tax sale, the treasurer shall separately offer and sell those parcels listed in a verified statement timely received and properly published and which remain liable to sale for delinquent taxes. This sale shall be known as the “public nuisance tax sale”. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the percentage interest that may be purchased in a parcel offered for sale under this section shall not be less than one hundred percent.\n\n5.

The county attorney shall, upon request of the county treasurer, assist in prosecution of action authorized under this section and sections 445.3 and 445.4.\n\nb. The remedies associated with tax sale and personal judgment may be simultaneously pursued until such time as the total amount due has been collected or otherwise discharged.
