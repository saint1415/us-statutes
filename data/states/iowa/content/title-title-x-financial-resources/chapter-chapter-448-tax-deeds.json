If the action seeks an order of the court to allow redemption after delivery of the treasurer’s deed based on improper service of notice of expiration of right of redemption, the action shall be brought in accordance with section 447.8. If the action is not brought under section 447.7 or 447.8, the action shall be controlled by the provisions of this section.\n\n2.

An owner or holder of a title or purported title who has entered into a lease agreement conveying possessory rights in the parcel to a tenant in possession shall be deemed to be in possession for purposes of filing an affidavit under this section.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, if a tax deed or instrument purporting to be a tax deed has been issued to convey an undivided interest in the parcel of less than one hundred percent, the owner or holder of the tax title or purported tax title shall be deemed to be in possession and entitled to file the affidavit in subsection 1. However, before filing the affidavit, the owner or holder of the tax title or purported tax title shall serve a copy of the affidavit on any other person in possession of the parcel by sending a copy of the affidavit by both regular and certified mail to the person at the address of the parcel or at the person’s last known address if different from the address of the parcel. Such service is deemed completed when the affidavit mailed by certified mail is postmarked for delivery. An affidavit of service shall be attached to, and filed with, the affidavit in subsection 1. The affidavit of service shall include the names and addresses of all persons served and the time of mailing.\n\n[C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §448.15]\n\n91 Acts, ch 191, §113; 95 Acts, ch 57, §23; 2000 Acts, ch 1058, §56; 2005 Acts, ch 34, §23, 26; 2007 Acts, ch 101, §1\n\nReferred to in §447.7, 447.8, 448.3, 448.6, 448.16, 448.17",
