The department may retain from the amounts collected a fee established by agreement with the department or agency of the other state.\n\nb. The director of revenue shall have the authority to enter into an agreement with a department or agency of any other state for the centralized debt collection facility to collect delinquent accounts, charges, fees, loans, taxes, or other indebtedness owed to, placed with, or being collected by the other state. The obligations or indebtedness of the other state referred to the facility must be delinquent and not subject to litigation, claim, appeal, or review pursuant to the appropriate remedies of the state.

Upon referral of a delinquent balance from the department or agency of another state pursuant to paragraph “b”, the department shall send written notification to the obligor by regular mail to the obligor’s last known mailing address. The notification shall contain an explanation of the balance owed, the department or agency to which the balance is owed, that the department has entered into an agreement to collect the balance owed, and the obligor’s opportunity to give written notice of intent to contest the department’s right to collect the amount owed.\n\n3. a. Challenges under this section may be initiated only by an obligor. The department’s review of its right to reciprocal collection is not subject to chapter 17A.\n\nb.

The department shall review the information provided by the referring department or agency and shall obtain additional information if necessary to establish that the liability is delinquent and not subject to appeal, or to verify the identity of the obligor or the amount owed. The department shall set a time to occur within ten days of receipt of the challenge to review the relevant facts of the challenge with the obligor. An alternative time may be set at the request of the obligor.

A certificate by the secretary of state of such other state that an officer suing for the collection of such a tax is duly authorized to collect the same shall be conclusive proof of such authority.\n\nc. The courts of this state shall not enforce interest rates or penalties on taxes of any other state which exceed the interest rates and penalties imposed by the state of Iowa for the same or a similar tax.\n\n5. Thirty days following the mailing of notice pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “c”, if no written challenge is received, or upon the department providing notice of denial of a challenge pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “e”, any tax amount referred to the facility under subsection 2 shall be treated as the equivalent of individual income tax that is final, due and payable, and may be collected in any manner authorized under the law for collection of a delinquent tax liability, including but not limited to the recording of a notice of state tax lien or issuance of a distress warrant.\n\n6.

The amount levied shall be sufficient to repay the loan in semiannual installments during the course of the reappraisal project as specified by a repayment schedule established by the director. The repayment schedule shall provide for repayment of the loan not later than one year following the completion of the reassessment. Semiannual repayments of the proceeds of the loan shall be made on or before December 1 and May 1 of each year.\n\n7. Any reassessment of property ordered by the director, whether or not undertaken with funds provided in this section, shall be conducted by the assessor in accordance with the Iowa real property appraisal manual issued under authority of section 421.17, subsection 17, the assessment laws of this state, and any reassessment order issued by the director under authority of this chapter.

(1) The department shall prepare a statement which sets forth in simple and nontechnical terms all of the following:\n\n(a) The rights of a taxpayer and the obligations of the department during an audit.\n\n(b) The procedures by which a taxpayer may appeal an adverse decision of the department, including administrative and judicial appeals.\n\n(c) The procedures which the department may use in enforcing the tax laws, including notices of assessment and jeopardy assessment and the filing and enforcement of liens.\n\n(2) The statement prepared in accordance with this paragraph shall be available on the department’s internet site. The internet site for this information shall be distributed by the department to all taxpayers at the first contact by the department with respect to the determination or collection of any tax, except in the case of simply providing tax forms.\n\nb. The department shall furnish to the taxpayer, before or at the time of issuing a notice of assessment or denial of a refund claim, an explanation of the reasons for the assessment or refund denial. An inadequate explanation shall not invalidate the notice. For purposes of this section, an explanation by the department shall be sufficient where the amount of tax, interest, and penalty is stated together with an attachment setting forth the computation of the tax by the department.\n\nc. (1) If the notice of assessment or denial of a claim for refund relates to a tax return filed pursuant to section 422.14 or chapter 450 by the taxpayer which designates an individual as an authorized representative of the taxpayer with respect to that return, or if a power of attorney has been filed with the department by the taxpayer which designates an individual as an authorized representative of the taxpayer with respect to any tax that is included in the notice of assessment or denial of a claim for refund, a copy of the notice together with any additional information required to be sent to the taxpayer shall be sent to the authorized representative as well.\n\n(2) If the department fails to mail a notice of assessment to the last known address of a taxpayer or fails to personally deliver such notice to a taxpayer, interest for the month such mailing or personal delivery fails to occur through the month of the correct mailing or personal delivery is waived.\n\n(3) If the department fails to mail a notice of assessment or denial of a claim for refund to the taxpayer’s last known address or fails to personally deliver such notice to a taxpayer and, if applicable, to the taxpayer’s authorized representative, the time period to appeal the notice of assessment or a denial of a claim for refund is suspended until the notice or claim denial is correctly mailed or personally delivered, or in any event, for a period not to exceed one year, whichever is the lesser period.\n\n(4) Collection activities, except where a jeopardy situation exists, shall be suspended and the statute of limitations for assessment or collection of the tax shall be tolled during the period in which interest is waived.\n\nd. (1) A taxpayer is permitted to designate in writing the type of tax and tax periods to which any voluntary payment relates, provided that separate written instructions accompany the payment. This paragraph does not apply to jeopardy assessments and does not apply if the department has to enforce collection of the payment.\n\n(2) As used in this paragraph, “tax period” means a period of time for which a return is required.\n\ne. All Iowa taxes which are administered by the department and which result in a refund shall accrue interest at the rate in effect under section 421.7 from the first day of the second calendar month following the date of payment or the date the return upon which the refund is claimed was due to be filed, including any extensions, or was filed, whichever is the latest.\n\nf. A taxpayer may appeal a refund claim to the director if a claim for refund has been filed and not denied by the department within six months of the filing of the claim. The filing of an appeal by a taxpayer shall not affect the ability of the department to examine and inspect a taxpayer’s records.\n\ng. A taxpayer may request in writing that a contested case proceeding be commenced by the department after a period of six months from the filing of a proper appeal by the taxpayer. The department shall file an answer within thirty days of receipt of the request and a contested case proceeding shall be commenced. In the case of an appeal of an assessment, failure to answer within the thirty-day time period and after a request has been made shall result in the suspension of interest from the time that the department was required to answer until the date that the department files its answer. In the case of an appeal of a denial of a refund, failure to answer within the thirty-day time period, and after a request has been made, shall result in the accrual of interest payable to the taxpayer at double the rate in effect under section 421.7 from the time the department was required to answer until the date that the department files its answer.\n\nh. A taxpayer who has failed to appeal a notice of assessment to the department within the time provided by law may contest the assessment by paying the tax, interest, and penalty, which in the case of divisible taxes might not be the entire liability and by filing a refund claim within the time period provided for filing such claim. The filing of a refund claim allows the time period for which the refund is claimed to be open to examination and to be open to offset, to zero, based upon any issue associated with the type of tax for which the refund is claimed and which has not up to that time been resolved between the taxpayer and the department, irrespective of whether the period of limitations to issue a notice of assessment has expired. The department may make this offset at any time until the department grants or denies the refund.\n\ni. The director shall adopt rules for setting times and places for taxpayer interviews and to permit any taxpayer to record the interviews.\n\nj. If the determination that a return is incorrect is the result of an audit of the books and records of the taxpayer, the tax or additional tax, if any, shall be assessed and the notice of assessment to the taxpayer shall be given by the department within one year after the completion of the examination of the books and records.\n\nk. The department shall annually report to the general assembly all areas of recurrent taxpayer noncompliance with rules or guidelines issued by the department and shall make recommendations concerning the noncompliance in the report.\n\n3. Installment payments. The department may permit the payment of a delinquent tax on a deferred basis where the equities indicate that a deferred payment agreement would be in the interest of the state and that without a deferred payment agreement the taxpayer would experience extreme financial hardship. A deferred payment agreement shall include applicable penalty and interest at the rate in effect under section 421.7 on the unpaid balance of the liability.\n\na. A prevailing taxpayer in an administrative hearing or a court proceeding related to the determination, collection, or refund of a tax, penalty, or interest may be awarded reasonable litigation costs by the department or a court that are incurred subsequent to the issuance of the notice of assessment or denial of claim for refund in the proceeding, based upon the following:\n\n(1) The reasonable expenses of expert witnesses.\n\n(2) The reasonable costs of studies, reports, and tests.\n\n(3) The reasonable fees of independent attorneys or independent accountants retained by the taxpayer.\n\n(4) An award for reasonable litigation costs shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars per case.\n\nb. An award under paragraph “a” shall not be made with respect to a portion of the proceedings during which the prevailing taxpayer has unreasonably protracted the proceedings.\n\nc. For purposes of this section, “prevailing taxpayer” means a taxpayer who establishes that the position of the state was not substantially justified and who has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy or has substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented. The determination of whether a taxpayer is a prevailing taxpayer is to be determined in accordance with chapter 17A.\n\nd. An award for reasonable litigation costs shall be paid to the taxpayer from the general fund of the state. For purposes of this subsection, there is appropriated from the general fund of the state an amount sufficient to pay each taxpayer entitled to an award under this subsection.\n\ne. This subsection does not apply to the tax imposed by chapter 453B if the department relied upon information provided or action conducted by federal, state, or local officials or law enforcement agencies.\n\n5. Damages. Notwithstanding section 669.14, subsection 2, if the director or an employee of the department recklessly or intentionally disregards any tax law or rule in the collection of any tax, or if the director or an employee of the department knowingly or negligently fails to release a lien against or bond on a taxpayer’s property, the taxpayer may file a claim in accordance with the Iowa tort claims Act, chapter 669, for damages against the state. However, the damages shall be limited to the actual direct economic damages suffered by the taxpayer as a proximate result of the actions of the director or employee, plus costs, reduced by the amount of such damages and costs as could reasonably have been mitigated by the taxpayer. The Iowa tort claims Act shall be the exclusive remedy for recovering damages resulting from such actions. This subsection does not apply to the tax imposed by chapter 453B.\n\n6. Burden of proof. The burden of proof with respect to assessments or denial of refunds in contested case proceedings shall be allocated as follows:\n\na. With respect to the issue of fraud with intent to evade tax, the burden of proof is upon the department. The burden of proof must be carried by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nb. In a case where the assessment was not made within six years after the return became due, excluding any extension of time for filing, the burden of proof shall be upon the department. However, the burden of proof shall be upon the taxpayer where the determination of the department is the result of the final disposition of a matter between the taxpayer and the internal revenue service or where the taxpayer and the department have signed a waiver of the statute of limitations.\n\nc. In all other cases, the burden of proof shall be upon the taxpayer who challenges the assessment or refund denial, except that, with respect to any new matter or affirmative defense, the burden of proof shall be upon the department. For purposes of this provision, “new matter” means an adjustment not set forth in the computation of the tax in the assessment or refund denial as distinguished from a new reason for the assessment or refund denial. “Affirmative defense” is one resting on facts not necessary to support the taxpayer’s case.\n\n7. Employee evaluations. It is unlawful to base a performance evaluation for an employee of the department on the total amount of assessments issued by that employee.\n\n8. Refund of untimely assessed taxes. Notwithstanding any other refund statute, if it appears that an amount of tax, penalty, or interest has been paid to the department after the expiration of the statute of limitations for the department to determine and assess or collect the amount of such tax due, then the amount paid shall be credited against another tax liability of the taxpayer which is outstanding, if the statute of limitations for assessment or collection of that other tax has not expired or the amount paid shall be refunded to the person or, with the person’s approval, credited to tax to become due. An application for refund or credit under this subsection must be filed within one year of payment. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the department from offsetting the refund claim against any tax due, if the statute of limitations for that other tax has not expired. However, any tax, penalty, or interest due for which a notice of assessment was not issued by the department but which was voluntarily paid by a taxpayer after the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment shall not be refunded.\n\n9. No applicability to real property. The provisions of this section do not apply to the assessment and taxation of real property.\n\n10. Illegal tax. A tax shall not be collected by the department if it is prohibited under the Constitution of the United States or laws of the United States, or under the Constitution of the State of Iowa.\n\n11. Electronic communication.\n\na. As used in this subsection, “electronic communication” means a notice, correspondence, or other communication provided electronically.\n\nb. The department of revenue, by rule, may permit a person to elect to receive an electronic communication from the department.\n\nc. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, when an electronic communication is posted to the department’s electronic portal for a person who has made such an election, the posting of the electronic communication shall satisfy any requirement of mailing or personal service in this Title, chapter 17A, chapter 272D, or sections 321.105A and 533.329.\n\n(2) The department may send any notice, correspondence, or other communication by mail to a person who has elected to receive an electronic communication from the department.\n\n(3) If the department sends a notice, correspondence, or other communication by both mail and by electronic communication, service occurs upon the earlier of when the communication is posted to the department’s electronic portal or mailed.\n\nd. The director of revenue may adopt rules and establish procedures under this subsection.\n\n94 Acts, ch 1133, §1, 16; 95 Acts, ch 83, §2; 2000 Acts, ch 1189, §28, 34; 2002 Acts, ch 1122, §2, 4; 2008 Acts, ch 1119, §6; 2008 Acts, ch 1184, §53; 2010 Acts, ch 1138, §52; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §143; 2014 Acts, ch 1076, §15; 2015 Acts, ch 109, §6, 75; 2018 Acts, ch 1161, §3, 15, 16; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §8, 9; 2021 Acts, ch 151, §3; 2022 Acts, ch 1061, §18; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §24, 40, 51\n\nReferred to in §15.335, 422.10, 422.16, 422.16B, 422.25, 422.28, 422.33, 422.75, 422.91, 423.4, 423.37, 450.94, 452A.65\n\n2023 strike of subsection 2, former paragraphs i and m effective January 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §40\n\nSubsection 2, paragraphs i and m stricken and former paragraphs j – l redesignated as i – k\n\nSubsection 11, paragraph c, subparagraph (1) amended",

As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Obligor” means a person, not including a public agency, who has been determined to owe a qualifying debt.\n\nb. “Public agency” means a board, commission, department, including the department of revenue, or other administrative office or unit of the state of Iowa or any other state entity reported in the Iowa annual comprehensive financial report, or a political subdivision of the state, or an office or unit of a political subdivision. “Public agency” does include the clerk of the district court as it relates to the collection of a qualifying debt. “Public agency” does not include the general assembly or office of the governor.\n\nc. “Public payment” means any claim a public agency owes to an obligor.\n\nd. “Qualifying debt” means any of the following:\n\n(1) Any debt, which is assigned to the department of health and human services, or which is owed to the department of health and human services for unpaid premiums under section 249A.3, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), or which child support services is otherwise attempting to collect, or which foster care services of the department of health and human services is attempting to collect on behalf of a child receiving foster care provided by the department of health and human services.\n\n(2) Any debt which is in the form of a liquidated sum due, owing, and payable to the clerk of the district court.\n\n(3) Any liquidated sum certain, owing, and payable to a public agency, with respect to which the public agency has provided the obligor an opportunity to protest or challenge the sum in a manner in compliance with applicable law and due process, and which has been determined as owing through the challenge or protest, or for which the time period provided by the public agency to challenge or protest has expired.\n\n2. Setoff procedure. The department shall establish and maintain a procedure to set off against each public payment any qualifying debt the obligor owes to a public agency. The procedure shall only apply when the department determines, in its discretion, it is feasible and complies with applicable law. The procedure shall meet the following conditions:\n\na. Each participating public agency shall obtain and forward to the department the full name and social security number of each obligor, or similar identifying information for an obligor who is not a natural person, and any other information concerning the person the department shall require. The department shall cooperate with public agencies in the exchange of information relevant to identifying public payments and qualifying debt that may be subject to setoff. However, the department shall provide only relevant information required by a public agency. The information shall be held in confidence and used for the purpose of setoff only. Section 422.72, subsection 1, does not apply to this paragraph.\n\nb. Each participating public agency shall, at least annually, certify to the department the information required by paragraph “a”, the amount of each obligor’s liability to and the amount of each claim on the public agency, and that all liabilities submitted constitute qualifying debt. The department may, by rule, require more frequent certifications or certifications of additional information about the qualifying debt or the obligor. The department may, in its discretion, review the accuracy of any certification made pursuant to this paragraph.\n\nc. The department may, by rule, establish a minimum amount of liabilities and claims that may be setoff.\n\nd. Upon submission of an allegation of liability by a public agency, the department shall notify the public agency whether the obligor is entitled to a public payment, and, if so entitled, shall notify the public agency of the amount of the obligor’s entitlement and last address known to the department. Section 422.72, subsection 1, does not apply to this paragraph.\n\ne. Upon notice of entitlement to a public payment, the department shall send written notification to the obligor and any known co-payee of the public payment. The notification shall contain the public agency’s assertion of its rights to all or a portion of the payment and of the public agency’s entitlement to recover the liability through the setoff procedure, the basis of the assertion, the opportunity to request that a jointly or commonly owned right to payment be divided among owners, and the obligor’s opportunity to give written notice of intent to contest the setoff procedure or that the debt is a qualifying debt.\n\nf. Upon the request of an obligor or a co-payee of the public payment received by the department within the time period provided in the written notification, and upon receipt of the full name and social security number of the co-payee, or similar identifying information of a co-payee who is not a natural person, the department shall notify the public agency that the public agency shall divide a jointly or commonly owned right to payment in the manner determined by the department. Any jointly or commonly owned right to payment is rebuttably presumed to be owned in equal portions by its joint or common owners.\n\ng. The department shall, after the department has sent the notice to the obligor provided in paragraph “e”, set off the amount last certified by the public agency as owed to the agency against the public payment. The department shall refund any balance of the payment to the obligor. The department shall periodically transfer amounts set off to the public agencies entitled to them, reduced by any fees charged for setoff. If an obligor gives written notice of intent to contest a setoff, the public agency shall hold a refund or rebate until final disposition of the challenge. Upon completion of the setoff, the department shall provide written notice of the completed setoff to the obligor and any co-payees of the payment subject to setoff.\n\nh. The department’s existing right to credit against tax due or to become due under section 422.73 is not to be impaired by a right granted to or a duty imposed upon the department by this section. This section is not intended to impose upon the department any additional requirement of notice, hearing, or appeal concerning the right to credit against tax due under section 422.73.\n\ni. If the alleged liability is owing and payable to the clerk of the district court and setoff as provided in this section is sought, all of the following shall apply:\n\n(1) The judicial branch shall prescribe procedures to permit an obligor to contest the amount of the obligor’s liability to the clerk of the district court.\n\n(2) The department shall, except for the procedures described in subparagraph (1), provide for any other applicable procedures concerning setoff as provided in this subsection.\n\n(3) Upon completion of the setoff, the department shall file, at least monthly, with the clerk of the district court a notice of satisfaction of each obligation to the full extent of all moneys collected in satisfaction of the obligation. The clerk shall record the notice and enter a satisfaction for the amounts collected. A separate written notice is not required.\n\n3. Challenges to a setoff.\n\na. Challenges under this section may be initiated only by an obligor. The department’s review of a challenge to a setoff is not subject to chapter 17A.\n\nb. The obligor challenging the setoff shall submit a written challenge in the manner provided in the notice described in subsection 2, paragraph “e”, within fifteen days of the date of the notice.\n\nc. The department, upon receipt of a written challenge, shall provide written notice of the challenge to the public agency. The department shall review the information submitted by the public agency prior to the setoff and shall obtain additional information from the public agency if necessary to establish that the liability is a qualified debt, or to verify the identity of the obligor or the amount owed. The department shall set a time to occur within ten days of receipt of the challenge to review the relevant facts of the challenge with the obligor. An alternative time may be set at the request of the obligor. If the obligor does not participate in the review at the scheduled time and an alternative time is not requested and approved, the review shall take place without the obligor being present. Information in favor of the obligor and the public agency shall be considered in the review. Only a determination that the debt is not a qualified debt or a mistake of fact, including a mistake in the identity of the obligor, or a mistake in the amount owed, shall be considered as a reason to deny or modify the setoff.\n\nd. If the department determines that a mistake of fact has occurred or that the liability submitted does not constitute a qualified debt, the public agency shall promptly return the setoff funds to the original payee or payees unless there is another qualifying debt available for setoff.\n\ne. If the department finds no mistake of fact and that the liability is a qualified debt, the department shall provide a notice of that effect to the obligor and the public agency, and the public agency shall retain the funds subject to setoff.\n\nf. The obligor shall have the right to file an action for wrongful setoff in district court within thirty days of the date of the notice to the obligor provided in paragraph “e”, either in the county where the obligor is located or the county where the main office of the public agency is located. The defendant in such action shall be the public agency, with an additional copy of such petition to be served upon the office of the attorney general. Actions under this section are in equity and not actions at law and are an obligor’s exclusive remedy to challenge any action arising from or related to this section.\n\ng. Recovery under this subsection is limited to restitution from the public agency of the amount that has been wrongfully setoff or obtained by the public agency.\n\nh. A challenge under this subsection shall not be used to extend, toll, or reopen the statute of limitations to challenge or contest a qualified debt. Only mistakes of fact, failure of the public agency to comply with the provisions of this section, or a liability that is not a qualified debt, shall constitute grounds for challenge under this subsection.\n\n4. Priority. In the case of multiple claims to payments filed under this section, priority shall be given to claims filed by child support services or foster care services, next priority shall be given to claims filed by the clerk of the district court, next priority shall be given to claims filed by the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing relating to investigations by the department, next priority shall be given to claims that will be deposited into the state general fund, and last priority shall be given to claims filed by other public agencies. In the case of multiple claims in which the priority is not otherwise provided by this subsection, priority shall be determined in accordance with rules to be established by the department.\n\n5. Reciprocal agreements. The director shall have the authority to enter into reciprocal agreements with departments or agencies of other states that have established a setoff procedure.\n\n6. Fees. The department may establish fees for use of the setoff system to be paid by participating public agencies to the department.\n\n2020 Acts, ch 1064, §16, 28; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §73, 74; 2022 Acts, ch 1045, §7, 8; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1353, 1358, 1359, 2042, 2044; 2023 Acts, ch 64, §104, 111; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §43, 44\n\nReferred to in §8A.323, 96.11, 99D.2, 99D.28, 99F.1, 99F.19, 99G.38, 217.34, 234.8, 256.197, 321.11A, 321.31, 321.40, 422.12K, 422.20, 422.72, 456A.16, 602.8102(58A), 602.8107, 642.2\n\n2020 enactment of section is effective on the date of rules adopted by the department of revenue to implement 2020 Acts, ch 1064, see 2020 Acts, ch 1064, §28; 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §73, 74; the Code editor received notice that the system designed to implement the setoff procedures established in 2020 Acts, ch 1064, and the accompanying rules, will be operational on November 13, 2023; rules governing transition, see 2020 Acts, ch 1118, §72\n\nNEW section",
