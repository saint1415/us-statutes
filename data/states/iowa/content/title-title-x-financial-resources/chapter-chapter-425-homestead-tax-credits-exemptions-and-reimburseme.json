The director of the department of administrative services shall issue warrants on the homestead credit fund payable to the county treasurers of the several counties of the state under this subchapter.\n\n2. The homestead credit fund shall be apportioned each year so as to give a credit against the tax on each eligible homestead in the state in an amount equal to the actual levy on the first four thousand eight hundred fifty dollars of actual value for each homestead.\n\n3. The amount due each county shall be paid in two payments on November 15 and March 15 of each fiscal year, drawn upon warrants payable to the respective county treasurers. The two payments shall be as nearly equal as possible.\n\n4. Annually the department of revenue shall certify to the county auditor of each county the credit and its amount in dollars. Each county auditor shall then enter the credit against the tax levied on each eligible homestead in each county payable during the ensuing year, designating on the tax lists the credit as being from the homestead credit fund, and credit shall then be given to the several taxing districts in which eligible homesteads are located in an amount equal to the credits allowed on the taxes of the homesteads. The amount of credits shall be apportioned by each county treasurer to the several taxing districts as provided by law, in the same manner as though the amount of the credit had been paid by the owners of the homesteads. However, the several taxing districts shall not draw the funds so credited until after the semiannual allocations have been received by the county treasurer, as provided in this subchapter. Each county treasurer shall show on each tax receipt the amount of credit received from the homestead credit fund.\n\n5. If the homestead tax credit computed under this section is less than sixty-two dollars and fifty cents, the amount of homestead tax credit on that eligible homestead shall be sixty-two dollars and fifty cents subject to the limitation imposed in this section.\n\n6.

The person claiming the credit shall file a verified statement and designation of homestead with the assessor for the year for which the person is first claiming the credit. The claim shall be filed not later than July 1 of the year for which the person is claiming the credit. A claim filed after July 1 of the year for which the person is claiming the credit shall be considered as a claim filed for the following year.\n\n2. Upon the filing and allowance of the claim, the claim shall be allowed on that homestead for successive years without further filing as long as the property is legally or equitably owned and used as a homestead by that person or that person’s spouse on July 1 of each of those successive years, and the owner of the property being claimed as a homestead declares residency in Iowa for purposes of income taxation, and the property is occupied by that person or that person’s spouse for at least six months in each of those calendar years in which the fiscal year begins. When the property is sold or transferred, the buyer or transferee who wishes to qualify shall refile for the credit. However, when the property is transferred as part of a distribution made pursuant to chapter 598, the transferee who is the spouse retaining ownership of the property is not required to refile for the credit. Property divided pursuant to chapter 598 shall not be modified following the division of the property. An owner who ceases to use a property for a homestead or intends not to use it as a homestead for at least six months in a calendar year shall provide written notice to the assessor by July 1 following the date on which the use is changed. A person who sells or transfers a homestead or the personal representative of a deceased person who had a homestead at the time of death, shall provide written notice to the assessor that the property is no longer the homestead of the former claimant.\n\n3. In case the owner of the homestead is in active service in the armed forces of this state or of the United States, or is sixty-five years of age or older, or is disabled, the statement and designation may be signed and delivered by any member of the owner’s family, by the owner’s guardian or conservator, or by any other person who may represent the owner under power of attorney. If the owner of the homestead is married, the spouse may sign and deliver the statement and designation. The director of health and human services or the director’s designee may make application for the benefits of this subchapter as the agent for and on behalf of persons receiving assistance under chapter 249.\n\n4. The form for claiming the credit shall also include the ability to claim the exemption under section 425.1A for qualified owners. If the claim for the homestead credit is allowed, such allowance shall also include allowance of the homestead exemption if the owner meets the age criteria for the exemption. The homestead exemption shall be allowed for successive years without further filing in the same manner as the homestead credit.\n\n5. Any person sixty-five years of age or older or any person who is disabled may request, in writing, from the appropriate assessor forms for filing for homestead tax credit. Any person sixty-five years of age or older or who is disabled may complete the form, which shall include a statement of homestead, and mail or return it to the appropriate assessor.

In the case of a claim for rent constituting property taxes paid, the claimant shall have rented the property during any part of the base year. In the case of a claim for property taxes due, the claimant shall have occupied the property during any part of the fiscal year beginning July 1 of the base year. If a homestead is occupied by two or more persons, and more than one person is able to qualify as a claimant, the persons may each file a claim based upon each person’s income and rent constituting property taxes paid or property taxes due.\n\n3. “Gross rent” means rental paid at arm’s length for the right of occupancy of a homestead or manufactured or mobile home, including rent for space occupied by a manufactured or mobile home not to exceed one acre. If the department of health and human services determines that the landlord and tenant have not dealt with each other at arm’s length, and the department of health and human services is satisfied that the gross rent charged was excessive, the department of health and human services shall adjust the gross rent to a reasonable amount as determined by the department of health and human services.\n\n4. “Homestead” means the dwelling owned or rented and actually used as a home by the claimant during the period specified in subsection 2, and so much of the land surrounding it including one or more contiguous lots or tracts of land, as is reasonably necessary for use of the dwelling as a home, and may consist of a part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building and a part of the land upon which it is built. It does not include personal property except that a manufactured or mobile home may be a homestead. Any dwelling or a part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building which is exempt from taxation, except for an exemption under section 425.1A, does not qualify as a homestead under this subchapter. However, solely for purposes of claimants living in a property and receiving reimbursement for rent constituting property taxes paid immediately before the property becomes tax exempt, and continuing to live in it after it becomes tax exempt, the property shall continue to be classified as a homestead. A homestead must be located in this state. When a person is confined in a nursing home, extended-care facility, or hospital, the person shall be considered as occupying or living in the person’s homestead if the person is the owner of the homestead and the person maintains the homestead and does not lease, rent, or otherwise receive profits from other persons for the use of the homestead.\n\n5. “Household” means a claimant and the claimant’s spouse if living with the claimant at any time during the base year. “Living with” refers to domicile and does not include a temporary visit.\n\n6. “Household income” means all income of the claimant and the claimant’s spouse in a household and actual monetary contributions received from any other person living with the claimant during their respective twelve-month income tax accounting periods ending with or during the base year.\n\n7. “Income” means the sum of Iowa net income as defined in section 422.7, plus all of the following to the extent not already included in Iowa net income: capital gains; alimony; child support money; cash public assistance and relief, except property tax relief granted under this subchapter; amount of in-kind assistance for housing expenses; total amounts received from a governmental or other pension or retirement plan, including defined benefit or defined contribution plans; annuities; individual retirement accounts; plans maintained or contributed to by an employer, or maintained or contributed to by a self-employed person as an employer; deferred compensation plans or any earnings attributable to the deferred compensation plans; income received pursuant to a farm tenancy agreement covering real property; railroad retirement benefits; payments received under the federal Social Security Act, except child insurance benefits received by a member of the claimant’s household; military retirement and veterans’ disability pensions; interest received from a state or federal government or any of its instrumentalities; workers’ compensation; and the gross amount of disability income or “loss of time” insurance. “Income” does not include gifts from nongovernmental sources, or surplus foods or other relief in kind supplied by a governmental agency. In determining income, net operating losses and net capital losses shall not be considered.\n\n8. “Property taxes due” means property taxes including any special assessments, but exclusive of delinquent interest and charges for services, due on a claimant’s homestead in this state, but includes only property taxes for which the claimant is liable and which will actually be paid by the claimant. However, if the claimant is a person whose property taxes have been suspended under sections 427.8 and 427.9, “property taxes due” means property taxes including any special assessments, but exclusive of delinquent interest and charges for services, due on a claimant’s homestead in this state, but includes only property taxes for which the claimant is liable and which would have to be paid by the claimant if the payment of the taxes has not been suspended pursuant to sections 427.8 and 427.9. “Property taxes due” shall be computed with no deduction for any credit under this subchapter or for any homestead credit allowed under subchapter I. Each claim shall be based upon the taxes due during the fiscal year next following the base year. If a homestead is owned by two or more persons as joint tenants or tenants in common, and one or more persons are not members of claimant’s household, “property taxes due” is that part of property taxes due on the homestead which equals the ownership percentage of the claimant and the claimant’s household. The county treasurer shall include with the tax receipt a statement that if the owner of the property is eighteen years of age or over, the person may be eligible for the credit allowed under this subchapter. If a homestead is an integral part of a farm, the claimant may use the total property taxes due for the larger unit. If a homestead is an integral part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building the property taxes due for the purpose of this subsection shall be prorated to reflect the portion which the value of the property that the household occupies as its homestead is to the value of the entire structure. For purposes of this subsection, “unit” refers to that parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of which the homestead is a part.\n\n9. “Rent constituting property taxes paid” means twenty-three percent of the gross rent actually paid in cash or its equivalent during the base year by the claimant or the claimant’s household solely for the right of occupancy of their homestead in the base year, and which rent constitutes the basis, in the succeeding year, of a claim for reimbursement under this subchapter by the claimant.\n\n10. “Special assessment” means an unpaid special assessment certified pursuant to chapter 384, subchapter IV. The claimant may include as a portion of the taxes due during the fiscal year next following the base year an amount equal to the unpaid special assessment installment due, plus interest, during the fiscal year next following the base year.\n\n11. “Totally disabled” means the inability to engage in any substantial gainful employment by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or is reasonably expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §425.17; 82 Acts, ch 1214, §1, 2, 4]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1139, §2, 3; 89 Acts, ch 233, §1; 90 Acts, ch 1250, §6; 91 Acts, ch 191, §19, 124; 92 Acts, ch 1016, §41\n\n; 92 Acts, 2nd Ex, ch 1001, §220, 225\n\n; 93 Acts, ch 156, §1, 2; 93 Acts, ch 180, §4, 15, 16, 22, 23; 94 Acts, ch 1125, §1, 2, 5; 94 Acts, ch 1165, §26, 50; 99 Acts, ch 152, §13, 40; 2001 Acts, ch 153, §15; 2001 Acts, ch 176, §80; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2011 Acts, ch 25, §89; 2015 Acts, ch 109, §8, 75; 2018 Acts, ch 1041, §127; 2019 Acts, ch 24, §51; 2021 Acts, ch 41, §16, 36; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §125, 131; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1129; 2023 Acts, ch 71, §43, 48, 49; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §48 – 50\n\nReferred to in §25B.7, 425.23, 425.24, 425.39, 425.40, 427.9, 435.22\n\n2021 amendment to subsection 2 applies to claims under chapter 425, subchapter II, filed on or after January 1, 2022; 2021 Acts, ch 177, §131\n\n2023 amendment to subsections 4 and 8 applies retroactively to assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2023; 2023 Acts, ch 71, §49\n\n2023 amendment to subsection 7 applies to claims under chapter 425, subchapter II, for credits against property taxes due and payable in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2024; 2023 Acts, ch 115, §50\n\nSubsections 3, 4, 7, and 8 amended",

The tentative credit for a claimant described in section 425.17, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), shall be the greater of the following:\n\n(1) The amount of the credit under the schedule specified in paragraph “a” of this subsection as if the claimant was a claimant as defined in section 425.17, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), filing for a credit under paragraph “a” of this subsection.\n\n(2) The difference between the actual amount of property taxes due on the homestead during the fiscal year next following the base year minus the actual amount of property taxes due on the homestead during the first fiscal year for which the claimant filed a claim for a credit calculated under this paragraph “c” and for which the property taxes due on the homestead were calculated on an assessed valuation that was not a partial assessment and if the claimant has filed for the credit calculated under this paragraph “c” for each of the subsequent fiscal years after the first credit claimed.\n\n2. The actual credit for property taxes due shall be determined by subtracting from the tentative credit the amount of the homestead credit under section 425.1 which is allowed as a credit against property taxes due in the fiscal year next following the base year by the claimant or any person of the claimant’s household. If the subtraction produces a negative amount, there shall be no credit but no refund shall be required. The actual reimbursement for rent constituting property taxes paid shall be equal to the tentative reimbursement.\n\n3. a. A person who is eligible to file a claim for credit for property taxes due and who has a household income of eight thousand five hundred dollars or less and who has an unpaid special assessment levied against the homestead may file a claim for a special assessment credit with the county treasurer. The department of revenue shall provide to the respective treasurers the forms necessary for the administration of this subsection. The claim shall be filed not later than September 30 of each year. Upon the filing of the claim, interest for late payment shall not accrue against the amount of the unpaid special assessment due and payable. The claim filed by the claimant constitutes a claim for credit of an amount equal to the actual amount due upon the unpaid special assessment, plus interest, payable during the fiscal year for which the claim is filed against the homestead of the claimant. However, where the claimant is an individual described in section 425.17, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2), and the tentative credit is determined according to the schedule in subsection 1, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2), of this section, the claim filed constitutes a claim for credit of an amount equal to one-half of the actual amount due and payable during the fiscal year. The treasurer shall certify to the director of revenue not later than October 15 of each year the total amount of dollars due for claims allowed. The amount of reimbursement due each county shall be certified by the director of revenue and paid by the director of the department of administrative services by November 15 of each year, drawn upon warrants payable to the respective treasurer. There is appropriated annually from the general fund of the state to the department of revenue an amount sufficient to carry out the provisions of this subsection. The treasurer shall credit any moneys received from the department of revenue against the amount of the unpaid special assessment due and payable on the homestead of the claimant.\n\nb. For purposes of this subsection, in computing household income, a person with a total disability shall deduct all medical and necessary care expenses paid during the twelve-month income tax accounting periods used in computing household income which are attributable to the person’s total disability. “Medical and necessary care expenses” are those used in computing the federal income tax deduction under section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in section 422.3.\n\n4. a. For the base year beginning in the 1999 calendar year and for each subsequent base year, the dollar amounts set forth in subsection 1, paragraphs “a” and “b”, and subsection 3 shall be multiplied by the cumulative adjustment factor for that base year. “Cumulative adjustment factor” means the product of the annual adjustment factor for the 1998 base year and all annual adjustment factors for subsequent base years. The cumulative adjustment factor applies to the base year beginning in the calendar year for which the latest annual adjustment factor has been determined.\n\nb. The annual adjustment factor for the 1998 base year is one hundred percent. For each subsequent base year, the annual adjustment factor equals the annual inflation factor for the calendar year, in which the base year begins, as computed in section 422.4 for purposes of the individual income tax.\n\nc.
