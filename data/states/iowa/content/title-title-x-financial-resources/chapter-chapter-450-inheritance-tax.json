By will or under the statutes of inheritance of this or any other state or country.\n\n2. By deed, grant, sale, gift, or transfer made within three years of the death of the grantor or donor, which is not a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth and which is in excess of the annual gift tax exclusion allowable for each donee under section 2503, subsections (b) and (e), of the Internal Revenue Code. If both spouses consent, a gift made by one spouse to a person who is not the other spouse is considered, for the purposes of this subsection, as made one half by each spouse under the same terms and conditions provided for in section 2513 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net market value of a transfer described in this subsection shall be the net market value determined as of the date of the transfer.\n\n3. By deed, grant, sale, gift, or transfer made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or donor. A transfer of property in respect of which the transferor reserves to the transferor a life income or interest shall be deemed to have been intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at death, provided, that if the transferor reserves to the transferor less than the entire income or interest, the transfer shall be deemed taxable thereunder only to the extent of a like proportion of the value of the property transferred.\n\n4. To the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the time of death a general power of appointment, or with respect to which the decedent has within three years of death exercised or released a general power of appointment by a disposition which is of a nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, the property would be includable in the decedent’s gross estate under this section whether the general power was created before or after the taking effect of this chapter. A transfer involving creation of a general power of appointment shall be treated as a transfer of a fee or equivalent interest in the property subject thereto to the donee of the power. Any transfer involving creation of any other power of appointment shall be treated, except when an election is made under subsection 7, as the transfer of a life estate or term of years in the property subject thereto to the donee of the power and as the transfer of the remainder interests to those who would take if the power is not exercised.\n\n5. Property which is held in joint tenancy by the decedent and any other person or persons or any deposit in banks, or other institution in their joint names and payable to either or to the survivor, except such part as may be proven to have belonged to the survivor; or any interest of a decedent in property owned by a joint stock or other corporate body whereby the survivor or survivors become beneficially entitled to the decedent’s interest upon the death of a shareholder. However, if such property is so held by the decedent and the surviving spouse as the only co-owners, one half of such property is not subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter, but if the surviving spouse proves that the surviving spouse contributed to acquisition of such property an amount, in money or other property, greater than one half of the cost of the property held in joint tenancy, the portion of such property which is not subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter shall be the proportion which the actual contribution by the surviving spouse is of the total contribution to acquisition of such property. The tax imposed upon the passing of property under the provisions of this subsection shall apply to property held under all such contracts or agreements whether made before or after the taking effect of this chapter.\n\n6. When the decedent shall have disposed of the decedent’s estate in any manner to take effect at the decedent’s death with a request secret or otherwise that the beneficiary give, pay to, or share the property or any interest therein received from the decedent, with other person or persons, or to so dispose of beneficial interests conferred by the decedent upon the beneficiaries as that the property so passing would be taxable under the provisions of this chapter if passing directly by will or deed from the decedent owner to those to receive the gift from the beneficiary, compliance with such request shall constitute a transfer taxable under the provisions of this chapter, at the highest rate possible in like cases of transfers by will or deed.\n\n7. a. Which qualifies as a qualified terminable interest property as defined in section 2056(b)(7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall, if an election is made, be treated and considered as passing in fee, or its equivalent, to the surviving spouse in the estate of the donor-grantor. Property on which the election is made shall be included in the gross estate of the surviving spouse and shall be deemed to have passed in fee from the surviving spouse to the persons succeeding to the remainder interest, unless the property was sold, distributed, or otherwise disposed of prior to the death of the surviving spouse. A sale, disposition, or disposal of the property prior to the death of the surviving spouse shall void the election, and shall subject the property disposed of, less amounts received or retained by the surviving spouse, to tax in the donor-grantor’s estate in the same manner as if the tax had been deferred under sections 450.44 through 450.49.\n\nb. Unless the will or trust instrument provides otherwise, the estate of the surviving spouse shall have the right to recover from the persons succeeding to the remainder interests, the additional tax imposed, if any, without interest, on the surviving spouse by reason of the election being made. The amount of tax recovered, if any, shall be a credit in the donee’s estate against the tax imposed on the qualified terminable interest property.\n\nc. An election under this subsection can only be made if an election in relation to the qualified terminable interest property is also made for federal estate tax purposes.\n\nd.

Notice of the lien is not required to be recorded. The rights of the state under the lien have priority over all subsequent mortgages, purchases, or judgment creditors; and a conveyance after the decedent’s death of the property subject to a lien does not discharge the property except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

The alternate value of the property, if the personal representative so elects, that has been established for federal estate tax purposes under section 2032 of the Internal Revenue Code. The election shall be exercised on the return by the personal representative or other person signing the return, within the time prescribed by law for filing the return or before the expiration of any extension of time granted for filing the return.\n\n2. Fair market value of real estate in the ordinary course of trade shall be established by agreement, including an agreement to accept the values as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes. The agreement shall be between the department of revenue, the personal representative, and the persons who have an interest in the property.\n\na. If an agreement has not been reached on the fair market value of real property in the ordinary course of trade, the director of revenue has sixty days after the return is filed to request an appraisal under section 450.27. If an appraisal request is not made within the sixty-day period, the value listed on the return is the agreed value of the real property.\n\nb. If an agreement is not reached on the fair market value of personal property in the ordinary course of trade, the personal representative or any person interested in the personal property may appeal to the director of revenue for a revision of the department of revenue’s determination of the value and after the appeal hearing may seek judicial review of the director’s decision. The provisions of section 450.94, subsection 3, relating to appeal of a determination of the department and review of the director’s decision apply to an appeal and review made under this subsection.\n\n3. In addition to the applicable period of limitation for examination and determination, the department shall make an examination to adjust the value of real property for Iowa inheritance tax purposes to the value accepted by the internal revenue service for federal estate tax purposes. The department shall make an examination and adjustment for the value of the real property at any time within six months from the date of receipt by the department of written notice from the personal representative for the estate that all federal estate tax matters between the estate and the internal revenue service have been concluded. To begin the running of the six-month period, the notice shall be in writing in a form sufficient to inform the department of the final disposition of the federal estate tax obligation with the internal revenue service and a copy of the federal document showing the final disposition and final federal adjustments of all real property values must be attached. The department shall make an adjustment to the value of real property for inheritance tax purposes to the value accepted for federal estate tax purposes regardless of whether an inheritance clearance has been issued, an appraisal has been obtained on the real property indicating a contrary value, whether there has been an acceptance of another value for real property by the department, or whether an agreement has been entered into by the department and the personal representative for the estate and persons having an interest in the real property regarding the value of the real property. Notwithstanding the period of limitation specified in section 450.94, subsection 3, the personal representative for the estate shall have six months from the day of final disposition of any real property valuation matter between the personal representative for the estate and the internal revenue service to claim a refund of an overpayment of tax due to the change in the valuation of real property by the internal revenue service.\n\n[S13, §1481-a8; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §7342; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §450.37; 81 Acts, ch 147, §6]\n\n83 Acts, ch 177, §15, 38; 84 Acts, ch 1305, §37; 88 Acts, ch 1028, §37; 89 Acts, ch 6, §6; 99 Acts, ch 151, §47, 89; 99 Acts, ch 152, §34, 40; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1073, §31\n\nReferred to in §450.27, 450.44, 450.45, 450.47, 450B.2",

When an inheritance tax return is filed, the department shall examine it and determine the correct amount of tax. If the amount paid is less than the correct amount due, the department shall notify the taxpayer of the total amount due together with any penalty and interest which shall be computed as a sum certain, with interest computed to the last day of the month in which the notice is dated.\n\n3. If the amount paid is greater than the correct tax, penalty, and interest due, the department shall refund the excess with interest in accordance with section 421.60, subsection 2, paragraph “e”. However, the director shall not allow a claim for refund or credit that has not been filed with the department within three years after the tax payment upon which a refund or credit is claimed became due, or one year after the tax payment was made, whichever time is later. A determination by the department of the amount of tax, penalty, and interest due, or the amount of refund for excess tax paid, is final unless the person aggrieved by the determination appeals to the director for a revision of the determination within sixty days from the date of the notice of determination of tax, penalty, and interest due or refund owing or unless the taxpayer contests the determination by paying the tax, interest, and penalty and timely filing a claim for refund. The director shall grant a hearing, and upon the hearing the director shall determine the correct tax, penalty, and interest or refund due, and notify the appellant of the decision by mail. The decision of the director is final unless the appellant seeks judicial review of the director’s decision under section 450.59 within sixty days after the date of the notice of the director’s decision.\n\n4.
