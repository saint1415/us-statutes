      "text": "437B.2 Definitions.\n\nAs used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n1. “Centrally assessed property tax” means property tax imposed with respect to the value of property determined by the director pursuant to sections 428.24 through 428.26, 428.28, and 428.29, Code 2013, and allocated to water service.\n\n2. “Consumer” means an end user of water used or consumed within the service area of a water utility. “Consumer” includes any master-metered facility even though the water delivered to such facility may ultimately be used by another person. A person to whom water is delivered by a master-metered facility is not a consumer. A “master-metered facility” means any multi-occupancy premises where units are separately rented or owned and where individual metering is impractical, where the facility is designated for elderly or handicapped persons and utility costs constitute part of the operating cost and are not apportioned to individual units, or where submetering or resale of service was permitted prior to 1966.\n\n3. “Delivery” means the physical transfer of water, excluding nonrevenue water, to a consumer for sale. Physical transfer to a consumer occurs when transportation of water ends and such water becomes available for use or consumption by a consumer.\n\n4. “Director” means the director of revenue.\n\n5. “Lease” means a contract between a lessor and lessee pursuant to which the lessee obtains a present possessory interest in tangible property without obtaining legal title in such property. A contract to deliver water using operating property within this state is not a lease. “Capital lease” means a lease classified as a capital lease under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n6. “Local taxing authority” means a city, county, community college, school district, or other taxing authority located in this state and authorized to certify a levy on property located within such authority for the payment of bonds and interest or other obligations of such authority.\n\n7. “Local taxing district” means a geographic area with a common consolidated property tax rate.\n\n8. a. “Major addition” means any acquisition on or after January 1, 2012, by a taxpayer, by transfer of ownership, self-construction, or capital lease of any interest in any of the following:\n\n(1) A building in this state where the acquisition cost of all interests acquired exceeds ten million dollars.\n\n(2) A water treatment plant where the acquisition cost of all interests acquired exceeds ten million dollars. For purposes of this subparagraph, “water treatment plant” means buildings and equipment used in that portion of the potable water supply system which in some way alters the physical, chemical, or bacteriological quality of the water.\n\n(3) Water utility operating property within a local taxing district where the acquisition cost of all interests acquired exceeds one million dollars.\n\n(4) Any water utility property in this state acquired by a person not previously subject to taxation under this chapter pursuant to section 437B.12.\n\nb. For purposes of this chapter, the acquisition cost of an asset acquired by capital lease is its capitalized value determined under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n9. “Nonrevenue water” means the difference between the total number of gallons of water carried through the water utility’s distribution system and the number of gallons of water delivered to consumers using the water utility’s distribution system.\n\n10. “Operating property” means all property owned by or leased to a water utility, not otherwise taxed separately, which is necessary to and without which the water utility could not perform the activities of a water utility.\n\n11. “Replacement tax” means the excise tax imposed on the delivery of water under section 437B.3.\n\n12. “Service area” means the geographical area within this state to which the water utility delivers water and related services. A water utility’s service area shall be that area described in the water utility’s tariff filed with the utilities board.\n\n13. “Tax year” means a calendar year beginning January 1 and ending December 31.\n\n14. “Taxable value” means as defined in section 437B.15, subsection 2, paragraph “e”.\n\n15. “Taxpayer” means a water utility or other person subject to the replacement tax imposed under section 437B.3.\n\n16. “Utilities board” means the utilities board created in section 474.1.\n\n17. “Water utility” or “rate-regulated water utility” means a person engaged primarily in the production, delivery, service, or sale of water in a service area, whether formed or organized under the laws of this state or elsewhere, and subject to the rate and service regulation of the utilities board pursuant to chapter 476. “Water utility” does not include a cooperative, municipal utility, or other entity engaged primarily in such activities that is not under the jurisdiction of the utilities board.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 94, §11, 35, 36; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §67, 68; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §274\n\nReferred to in §437B.11",

      "text": "437B.3 Replacement tax imposed on delivery of water.\n\n1. A replacement delivery tax is imposed on each water utility that delivers water to a consumer within the water utility’s service area. The replacement delivery tax imposed by this section is equal to the number of gallons of water delivered to consumers in the water utility’s service area by the taxpayer during the tax year multiplied by the replacement delivery tax rate in effect for the service area.\n\n2. The replacement delivery tax rate for each service area shall be calculated by the director as follows:\n\na. The director shall determine the centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to water delivery for those water utilities operating within the service area for the assessment year 2011 based on property tax amounts due and payable as the result of that assessment year.\n\nb. The director shall determine the number of gallons of water delivered to consumers in the service area which would have been subject to taxation under this section in calendar year 2011, had such section been in effect for calendar year 2011.\n\nc. The director shall determine a replacement delivery tax rate for each service area by dividing the centrally assessed property tax liability, as determined in paragraph “a”, by the number of gallons of water delivered, as specified in paragraph “b”.\n\n3. a. If for any tax year after calendar year 2012, the total number of gallons of water required to be reported by a water utility pursuant to section 437B.4, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, increases or decreases by more than the threshold percentage from the average of the base year amounts for that water utility for the immediately preceding five calendar years, the replacement tax rate imposed under subsection 1 for that tax year shall be recalculated by the director for that water utility so that the total of the tentative replacement delivery taxes required to be reported pursuant to section 437B.4, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, for that water utility with respect to the tax imposed under subsection 1, shall be as follows:\n\n(1) If the number of gallons of water required to be reported increased by more than the threshold percentage, one hundred two percent of such taxes required to be reported by the water utility for that water utility for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\n(2) If the number of gallons of water required to be reported decreased by more than the threshold percentage, ninety-eight percent of such taxes required to be reported by the water utility for that water utility for the immediately preceding tax year.\n\nb. For purposes of paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) and (2), in computing the tax rate under subsection 1, for tax year 2013, the director shall use the centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to water sales computed pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph “a”, or the water utility’s centrally assessed property tax liability for the assessment year 2010, whichever is greater, in lieu of the taxes required to be reported for that water utility for the immediately preceding tax year. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, if the total amount of replacement delivery taxes imposed on the water utility in any of those tax years is less than the utility’s centrally assessed property tax liability for the assessment year 2010, the replacement tax rate imposed under subsection 1 for that tax year shall be recalculated by the director so that the total amount of replacement delivery taxes imposed on the water utility for such tax year equals the water utility’s centrally assessed property tax liability for the assessment year 2010.\n\nc. For purposes of this section, “base year amount” means for calendar years prior to tax year 2013, the number of gallons of water delivered to consumers by the water utility which would have been subject to taxation under this section had this section been in effect for such calendar year, and for tax years after calendar year 2012, the number of gallons of water required to be reported by the water utility pursuant to section 437B.4, subsection 1.\n\nd. The threshold percentage shall be five percent.\n\n4. The replacement delivery tax rate in effect for each service area shall be published by the director in the Iowa administrative bulletin on or before May 31 of each year.\n\n5. If recalculation of the replacement delivery tax rate is required pursuant to subsection 3, the new rate shall be published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director by no later than May 31 following the end of the tax year. The director shall adjust the tentative replacement tax imposed by subsection 1 and required to be shown on any affected water utility’s return pursuant to section 437B.4, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, to reflect the adjusted replacement delivery tax rate for the tax year, and report such adjustment to the affected water utility on or before June 30 following the end of the tax year. The new replacement delivery tax rate shall apply prospectively, until such time as further adjustment is required.\n\n6. For a service area established as the result of the formation or organization of a new water utility on or after January 1, 2013, the director shall to the extent possible determine a replacement delivery tax rate for the new service area using the procedures of this section and for the information for the year that the water utility was first under the jurisdiction of the utilities board.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 94, §12, 35, 36\n\nReferred to in §437B.2, 437B.4",

Each taxpayer, on or before March 31 following a tax year, shall file with the director a return including but not limited to the following information:\n\na. The total taxable gallons of water delivered by the water utility to consumers within the service area during the tax year.\n\nb. The tentative replacement taxes imposed by section 437B.3 due for the tax year.\n\n2. A return shall be signed by an officer, or other person duly authorized by the water utility, and must be certified as correct and in accordance with forms and rules prescribed by the director.\n\n3. At the time of filing the return required by subsection 1 with the director, the taxpayer shall calculate the tentative replacement tax due for the tax year. The director shall compute any adjustments to the replacement tax required by subsection 5 and by section 437B.3, subsection 3, and notify the taxpayer of any such adjustments in accordance with the requirements of section 437B.3, subsection 5. The director and the department of management shall compute the allocation of replacement taxes among local taxing districts and report such allocations to county treasurers pursuant to section 437B.11. Based on such allocations, the treasurer of each county shall notify each taxpayer on or before August 31 following a tax year of its replacement tax obligation to the county treasurer. On or before September 30, 2014, and on or before September 30 of each subsequent year, the taxpayer shall remit to the county treasurer of each county to which such replacement tax is allocated pursuant to section 437B.11, one-half of the replacement tax so allocated, and on or before the succeeding March 31, the taxpayer shall remit to the county treasurers the remaining replacement tax so allocated. If notification of a taxpayer’s replacement tax obligation is not mailed by a county treasurer on or before August 31 following a tax year, such taxpayer shall have thirty days from the date the notification is mailed to remit one-half of the replacement tax otherwise required by this subsection to be remitted to such county treasurer on or before September 30. If a taxpayer fails to timely remit replacement taxes as provided in this subsection, the county treasurer of each affected county shall notify the director of such failure.\n\n4. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 3, a taxpayer shall not be required to file a return otherwise required by this section or remit any replacement tax for any tax year in which the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability before credits is three hundred dollars or less, provided that all water utilities shall file a return, regardless of the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability.\n\n5. Following the determination of replacement delivery tax rates by the director pursuant to section 437B.3, subsection 2, if an adjustment resulting from a taxpayer appeal is made to taxes levied and paid by a taxpayer with respect to the assessment year 2011 used in determining such rates, the director shall recalculate the replacement delivery tax rate for any affected water utility to reflect the impact of such adjustment as if such adjustment had been reflected in the initial determination of the centrally assessed property tax liability allocated to water service pursuant to section 437B.3, subsection 2, paragraph “a”. Rate recalculations shall be made and published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the director on or before March 31 following the calendar year in which a final determination of the adjustment is made. Taxpayers shall report to the director any increase or decrease in the tentative replacement tax required to be shown to be due pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph “b”, for any tax year with the return for the year in which the recalculated tax rates which gave rise to the adjustment are published in the Iowa administrative bulletin. The director and the department of management shall redetermine the allocation of replacement taxes pursuant to section 437B.11 for each affected tax year. If a taxpayer has overpaid replacement taxes, the overpayment shall be reported by the director to such taxpayer and to the appropriate county treasurers and shall be a credit against the replacement taxes owed by such taxpayer for the year in which the recalculated rates which gave rise to the overpayment are published in the Iowa administrative bulletin. If a taxpayer has overpaid centrally assessed property taxes for assessment years prior to tax year 2013, such overpayment shall be a credit against replacement taxes owed by such taxpayer for the year in which the overpayment is determined. Unused credits may be carried forward and used to reduce future replacement tax liabilities until exhausted.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 94, §13, 35, 36\n\nReferred to in §437B.3, 437B.5, 437B.11, 437B.20",

The period for the examination and determination of the correct amount of tax is unlimited in the case of a false or fraudulent return made with the intent to evade any tax or in the case of a failure to file a return.\n\n2. If a return required by section 437B.4, subsection 1, is not filed, or if such return when filed is incorrect or insufficient and the taxpayer fails to file a corrected or sufficient return within twenty days after such return is required by notice from the director, the director shall determine the amount of tax due from information as the director may be able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax due on the basis of external indices. The director shall give notice of the determination to the taxpayer liable for the tax and to the county treasurers to whom the tax is owed.

The lien shall be prior to and superior over all subsequent liens upon any personal property within this state, or right to such personal property, belonging to the taxpayer, without the necessity of recording the lien. The requirement for recording, as applied to the replacement tax imposed by this chapter, shall apply only to a lien upon real property. The lien may be preserved against subsequent mortgagees, purchasers, or judgment creditors, for value and without notice of the lien, on any real property situated in a county, by the county treasurer to which replacement tax is owed by filing with the recorder of the county in which the real property is located a notice of the lien.

      "text": "437B.11 Allocation of revenue.\n\n1. The director and the department of management shall compute the allocation of all replacement tax revenues among the local taxing districts in accordance with this section and shall report such allocation by local taxing districts to the county treasurers on or before August 15 following a tax year.\n\n2. The director shall determine and report to the department of management the total replacement taxes to be collected from each taxpayer for the tax year on or before July 30 following such tax year.\n\n3. a. All replacement taxes owed by a taxpayer shall be allocated among the local taxing districts in which such taxpayer’s property is located in accordance with a general allocation formula determined by the department of management on the basis of general property tax equivalents. General property tax equivalents shall be determined by applying the levy rates reported by each local taxing district to the department of management on or before June 30 following a tax year to the taxable value of taxpayer property allocated to each such local taxing district as adjusted and reported to the department of management in such tax year by the director pursuant to the procedures required pursuant to section 437B.15. The general allocation formula for a tax year shall allocate to each local taxing district that portion of the replacement taxes owed by each taxpayer which bears the same ratio as such taxpayer’s general property tax equivalents for each local taxing district bears to such taxpayer’s total general property tax equivalents for all local taxing districts in Iowa.\n\nb. If, during the tax year, a taxpayer transferred operating property or an interest in operating property to another taxpayer, the transferee taxpayer’s replacement tax associated with that property shall be allocated, for the tax year in which the transfer occurred, under this section in accordance with the general allocation formula on the basis of the general property tax equivalents of the transferor taxpayer.\n\nc. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if during the tax year a person who was not a taxpayer during the prior tax year acquires a new major addition, as defined in section 437B.2, subsection 8, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4), the replacement tax associated with that major addition shall be allocated, for that tax year, under this section in accordance with the general allocating formula on the basis of the general property tax equivalents established under paragraph “a” of this subsection, except that the levy rates established and reported to the department of management on or before June 30 following the tax year in which the major addition was acquired shall be applied to the prorated assessed value of the major addition. For purposes of this paragraph, “prorated assessed value of the major addition” means the assessed value of the major addition as of January 1 of the year following the tax year in which the major addition was acquired multiplied by the percentage derived by dividing the number of months that the major addition existed during the tax year by twelve, counting any portion of a month as a full month.\n\n4. On or before August 31 following tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, each county treasurer shall compute a special utility property tax levy or tax credit for each taxpayer for which a replacement tax liability for each such tax year is reported to the county treasurer pursuant to subsection 1, and shall notify the taxpayer of the amount of such tax levy or tax credit. The amount of the special utility property tax levy or credit shall be determined for each taxpayer by the county treasurer by comparing the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county pursuant to this section with the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county is less than the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, the county treasurer shall levy a special utility property tax equal to the shortfall which shall be added to and collected with the replacement tax owed by the taxpayer to the county treasurer for the tax year pursuant to section 437B.4, subsection 3. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county exceeds the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, the county treasurer shall issue a credit to the taxpayer which shall be applied to reduce the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability to the county treasurer for the tax year. If the taxpayer’s total replacement tax liability allocated to taxing districts in the county equals the anticipated tax revenues from the taxpayer for all taxing districts in the county, no levy or credit is required. Replacement tax liability for purposes of this subsection means replacement tax liability before credits allowed by section 437B.4, subsection 5. A recalculation of a special utility property tax levy or credit shall not be made as a result of a subsequent recalculation of replacement tax liability under section 437B.4, subsection 5, or adjustment to assessed value under section 437B.15. “Anticipated tax revenues from a taxpayer” means the product of the total levy rates imposed by the taxing districts and the value of taxpayer property allocated to the taxing districts and reported to the county auditor. Special utility property tax levies and credits shall be treated as replacement taxes for purposes of section 437B.7. If a special utility property tax levy payment becomes delinquent, the delinquent payment shall accrue interest and penalty in the same manner and amount as the replacement tax under section 437B.9.\n\n5. The replacement tax, as adjusted by any special utility property tax levy or credit and remitted to a county treasurer by each taxpayer, shall be treated as a property tax when received and shall be disbursed by the county treasurer as taxes on real estate. Notwithstanding the allocation provisions of this section, nothing in this section shall deny any municipality which has enacted an ordinance or entered into an agreement for the division and allocation of taxes authorized under section 403.19 and under which ordinance or agreement the taxes collected in respect of properties owned by any of the taxpayers remitting replacement taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter are being divided and allocated, the right to receive its share of the replacement tax revenues collected for any year which would otherwise be paid to such municipality under the terms of any such ordinance or agreement had this chapter not been enacted. To the extent that adjustment must be made to the allocation described in this section to give effect to the terms of such ordinances or agreements, the department of management and the county treasurer shall make such adjustments.\n\n6. In lieu of the adjustment provided for in subsection 5, the assessed value of property described in section 403.19, subsection 1, may be reduced by the city or county by the amount of the taxable value of the property described in section 437B.12 included in such area on January 1, 2011, pursuant to amendment of the ordinance adopted by such city or county pursuant to section 403.19.\n\n7. The utility replacement tax task force created in section 437A.15 shall study the effects of the replacement tax on local taxing authorities, local taxing districts, consumers, and taxpayers through January 1, 2019. If the task force recommends modifications to the replacement tax that will further the purposes of tax neutrality for local taxing authorities, local taxing districts, taxpayers, and consumers, consistent with the stated purposes of this chapter, the department of management shall transmit those recommendations to the general assembly.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 94, §20, 35, 36; 2016 Acts, ch 1128, §9, 16, 19\n\nReferred to in §437B.4",

For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) “Book value” means acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation determined under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n(2) “Taxpayer property” means property described in section 437B.12.\n\n(3) “To dispose of” means to sell, abandon, decommission, or retire an asset.\n\n(4) “Transfer” means a transaction which results in a change of ownership of taxpayer property and includes a capital lease transaction.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection, “taxpayer” includes a person who would have been a taxpayer in calendar year 2012 had the provisions of this chapter been in effect for the 2012 assessment year.\n\nd. If a taxpayer owns or leases pursuant to a capital lease less than the entire interest in a major addition, the local amount and statewide amount, if any, of such major addition shall be apportioned to the taxpayer on the basis of its percentage interest in such major addition.\n\n2. a. Beginning January 1, 2013, the assessed value of taxpayer property shall be adjusted annually as provided in this section. The director, with respect to each taxpayer, shall do all of the following:\n\n(1) Adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by the change in book value during the preceding calendar year of the local amount of any major addition reported within such local taxing district.\n\n(2) Adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by allocating the change in book value during the preceding calendar year of the statewide amount and all other taxpayer property described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (5), to the assessed value of all taxpayer property in the state pro rata according to its preadjustment value.\n\n(3) In the case of taxpayer property described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (3), (4), and (7), decrease the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district by the assessed value reported within such local taxing district.\n\n(4) In the event of a merger or consolidation of two or more taxpayers, to determine the assessed value of the surviving taxpayer, combine the assessed values of such taxpayers immediately prior to the merger or consolidation.\n\n(5) In the event any taxpayer property is eligible for the urban revitalization tax exemption described in chapter 404, adjust the assessed value of taxpayer property within each affected local taxing district to reflect such exemption.\n\n(6) In the event the assessed value of taxpayer property is adjusted as a result of taxpayer appeals, reduce the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district to reflect such adjustment. The adjustment shall be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the taxpayer’s assessed value among the local taxing districts determined without regard to this adjustment. An adjustment to the assessed value of taxpayer property shall be made as of January 1 of the year following the date on which the adjustment is finally determined.\n\nb. In no event shall the adjustments set forth in this subsection reduce the assessed value of taxpayer property in any local taxing district below zero.\n\nc. The director, on or before October 31 of each assessment year, shall report to the department of management and to the auditor of each county the adjusted assessed value of taxpayer property as of January 1 of such assessment year for each local taxing district. For purposes of this subsection, the assessed value of taxpayer property in each local taxing district subject to adjustment under this section by the director means the assessed value of such property as of the preceding January 1 as determined and allocated among the local taxing districts by the director.\n\nd. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to authorize local taxing authorities to exclude from the calculation of levy rates the taxable value of taxpayer property reported to county auditors pursuant to this subsection.\n\ne. In addition to reporting the assessed values as described in this subsection, the director, on or before October 31 of each assessment year, shall also report to the department of management and to the auditor of each county the taxable value of taxpayer property as of January 1 of such assessment year for each local taxing district. For purposes of this chapter, “taxable value” means the value for all property subject to the replacement tax annually determined by the director, by dividing the estimated annual replacement tax liability for that property by the current fiscal year’s consolidated taxing district rate for the taxing district where that property is located, then multiplying the quotient by one thousand. A taxpayer who paid more than five hundred thousand dollars in replacement tax in the previous tax year or who believes the taxpayer’s replacement tax liability will vary more than ten percent from the previous tax year shall report to the director by October 1 of the current calendar year, on forms prescribed by the director, the estimated replacement tax liability that will be attributable to all of the taxpayer’s property subject to replacement tax for the current tax year. The department shall utilize the estimated replacement tax liability as reported by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s prior year’s replacement tax amounts to estimate the current tax year’s taxable value for that property. Furthermore, a taxpayer who has a new major addition of operating property which is put into service for the first time in the current calendar year shall report to the director by October 1 of the current calendar year, or at the time the major addition is put into service, whichever time is later, on forms prescribed by the director, the cost of the major addition and, if not previously reported, shall report the estimated replacement taxes which that asset will generate in the current calendar year. For the purposes of computing the taxable value of property in a taxing district, the taxing district’s share of the estimated replacement tax liability shall be the taxing district’s percentage share of the assessed value allocated by property tax equivalent multiplied by the total estimated replacement tax. The assessed value allocated by property tax equivalent shall be determined by dividing the taxpayer’s current year assessed valuation in a taxing district by one thousand, and then multiplying by the prior year’s consolidated tax rate.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 94, §24, 35, 36\n\nReferred to in §437B.2, 437B.11",
