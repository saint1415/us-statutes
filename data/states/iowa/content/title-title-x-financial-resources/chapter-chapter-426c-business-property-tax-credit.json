A claim for credit filed after the deadline for filing claims shall be considered as a claim for the following year.\n\n3. Upon the filing of a claim and allowance of the credit, the credit shall be allowed on the parcel or property unit for successive years without further filing as long as the parcel or property unit satisfies the requirements for the credit. If the parcel or property unit ceases to qualify for the credit under this chapter, the owner shall provide written notice to the assessor by the date for filing claims specified in subsection 2 following the date on which the parcel or property unit ceases to qualify for the credit.\n\n4. The assessor shall remit the claims for credit to the county auditor with the assessor’s recommendation for allowance or disallowance. If the assessor recommends disallowance of a claim, the assessor shall submit the reasons for the recommendation, in writing, to the county auditor.

For each claim and allowance of a credit for a property unit, the county auditor shall calculate the average of all consolidated levy rates applicable to the several parcels within the property unit. All claims for credit which have been allowed by the board of supervisors, the actual value of such parcels and property units applicable to the fiscal year for which the credit is claimed that are subject to assessment and taxation prior to imposition of any applicable assessment limitation, the consolidated levy rates for such parcels and the average consolidated levy rates for such property units applicable to the fiscal year for which the credit is claimed, and the taxing districts in which the parcel or property unit is located, shall be certified on or before June 30, in each year, by the county auditor to the department.\n\n6. The assessor shall maintain a permanent file of current business property tax credits. The assessor shall file a notice of transfer of property for which a credit has been allowed when notice is received from the office of the county recorder, from the person who sold or transferred the property, or from the personal representative of a deceased property owner.

Except as provided in paragraph “b”, parcels classified and taxed as commercial property, industrial property, or railway property under chapter 434 are eligible for a credit under this chapter. A person may claim and receive one credit under this chapter for each eligible parcel unless the parcel is part of a property unit for which a credit is claimed. A person may claim and receive one credit under this chapter for each property unit. A credit approved for a property unit shall be allocated to the several parcels within the property unit in the proportion that each parcel’s total amount of property taxes due and payable bears to the total amount of property taxes due and payable on the property unit. Only property units comprised of property assessed as commercial property, industrial property, or railway property under chapter 434 are eligible for a credit under this chapter. The classification of property used to determine eligibility for the credit under this chapter shall be the classification of the property for the assessment year used to calculate the taxes due and payable in the fiscal year for which the credit is claimed.\n\nb. All of the following shall not be eligible to receive a credit under this chapter or be part of a property unit that receives a credit under this chapter:\n\n(1) Property that is rented or leased to low-income individuals and families as authorized by section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.\n\n(2) For credits claimed for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014, and the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, property that is a mobile home park, manufactured home community, land-leased community, assisted living facility, as those terms are defined in section 441.21, subsection 13, or that is property primarily used or intended for human habitation containing three or more separate dwelling units.\n\n2. Using the actual value of each parcel or property unit and the consolidated levy rate for each parcel or the average consolidated levy rate for each property unit, as certified by the county auditor to the department under section 426C.3, subsection 5, the department shall calculate, for each fiscal year, an initial amount of actual value for use in determining the amount of the credit for each such parcel or property unit so as to provide the maximum possible credit according to the credit formula and limitations under subsection 3, and to provide a total dollar amount of credits against the taxes due and payable in the fiscal year equal to ninety-eight percent of the moneys in the fund following the deposit of the appropriation for the fiscal year and including interest or earnings credited to the fund.\n\n3. a. The amount of the credit for each parcel or property unit for which a claim for credit under this chapter has been approved shall be calculated under paragraph “b” using the lesser of the initial amount of actual value determined by the department under subsection 2, and the amount of actual value of the parcel or property unit certified by the county auditor under section 426C.3, subsection 5.\n\nb. The amount of the credit for each parcel or property unit for which a claim for credit under this chapter has been approved shall be equal to the product of the amount of actual value determined under paragraph “a” times the difference, stated as a percentage, between the assessment limitation percentage applicable to the parcel or property unit under section 441.21, subsection 5, and the assessment limitation percentage applicable to residential property under section 441.21, subsection 4, divided by one thousand dollars, and then multiplied by the consolidated levy rate or average consolidated levy rate per one thousand dollars of taxable value applicable to the parcel or property unit for the fiscal year for which the credit is claimed as certified by the county auditor under section 426C.3, subsection 5.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 123, §6, 13; 2014 Acts, ch 1026, §143; 2014 Acts, ch 1131, §1, 4",

Each county auditor shall then enter the credits against the tax levied on each eligible parcel or property unit in the county, designating on the tax lists the credit as being paid from the fund. Each taxing district shall receive its share of the business property tax credit allowed on each eligible parcel or property unit in such taxing district in the proportion that the levy made by such taxing district upon the parcel or property unit bears to the total levy upon the parcel or property unit by all taxing districts. However, the several taxing districts shall not draw the moneys so credited until after the semiannual allocations have been received by the county treasurer, as provided in this section. Each county treasurer shall show on each taxpayer receipt the amount of credit received from the fund.\n\n2.

The notice shall state the reasons for disallowing the claim for the credit. The board of supervisors is not required to send notice that a claim for credit is disallowed if the claimant voluntarily withdraws the claim. Any person whose claim is disallowed under the provisions of this chapter may appeal from the action of the board of supervisors to the district court of the county in which the parcel or property unit is located by giving written notice of such appeal to the county auditor within twenty days from the date of mailing of notice of such action by the board of supervisors.\n\n2.

If the parcel or property unit for which the credit was allowed is not owned by the claimant, the amount may be recovered from the claimant by assessment in the same manner that income taxes are assessed under sections 422.26 and 422.30.
