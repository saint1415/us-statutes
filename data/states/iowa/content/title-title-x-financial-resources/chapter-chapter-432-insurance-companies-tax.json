A reinsurance tax shall not apply to premiums for risks or portions of risks that are subject to taxation on a direct basis pursuant to subsection 1.\n\nb. A reinsurance premium tax shall not be payable by a captive company in connection with the receipt by the captive company of assets in exchange for the assumption of loss reserves and other liabilities of another insurer under common ownership and control if the transaction is part of a plan to discontinue the operations of the other insurer, and if the intent of the parties to the transaction is to renew or maintain the other insurer’s business with the captive company.\n\nc. The amount of reinsurance tax due from a captive company under paragraph “a” shall be calculated as follows:\n\n(1) Two-tenths of one percent on the first twenty million dollars of assumed reinsurance premiums.\n\n(2) One-eighth of one percent on the twenty million dollars of assumed reinsurance premiums collected after the first twenty million dollars of assumed reinsurance premiums collected under subparagraph (1).\n\n(3) Five percent on each dollar of assumed reinsurance premiums collected after the twenty million dollars collected under subparagraph (1) and the twenty million dollars collected under subparagraph (2).\n\n3. a.

Each series of members of a limited liability company formed as a special purpose captive company shall be considered separately under this section, except that the minimum tax as described in paragraph “a” shall be considered in the aggregate.\n\n4. A captive company, other than a protected cell captive company, shall not be required to pay aggregate taxes under this section that exceed one hundred thousand dollars in any one tax year.\n\n5. Two or more captive companies under common ownership and control shall be taxed as a single captive company. For the purposes of this subsection, “common ownership and control” means either of the following:\n\na. In the case of a stock corporation, the direct or indirect ownership of eighty percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of two or more corporations by the same shareholder or shareholders.\n\nb.

In the case of a multiyear policy or a multiyear contract, the premium shall be prorated for the purpose of calculating the appropriate tax.\n\n2023 Acts, ch 107, §2\n\nReferred to in §521J.7, 521J.9, 521J.17, 521J.22\n\nNEW section",
