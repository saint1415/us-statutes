The lease agreement shall provide for the following:\n\n(1) An annual lease payment of one dollar during the initial five-year lease for the racetrack enclosure, which includes the racetrack, kennels, grandstand, and space for a new simulcast facility, and one five-year renewal of the lease agreement at a fair market rental rate.\n\n(2) Employees at the racetrack enclosure involved in pari-mutuel wagering as of the live racing cessation date, as provided in section 99D.9A, shall be offered employment by the Iowa greyhound association at the racetrack.\n\n(3) Existing collective bargaining agreements concerning employees at the racetrack shall be honored.\n\n(4) Live dog racing requirements. The requirements shall provide that the Iowa greyhound association conduct, for calendar year 2015, no fewer than sixty live race days with nine live races per day during the racing season, and for calendar year 2016 and subsequent calendar years covered by the lease agreement, no fewer than ninety-five live race days with nine live races per day during each racing season. However, upon mutual agreement by the parties subject to approval by the commission, the number of race days for one or more live racing seasons may be reduced so long as the Iowa greyhound association conducts a minimum number of live races and racing days during that season.\n\n(5) Termination provisions, to include termination of the agreement on January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which live dog racing as required by the agreement was not conducted by the Iowa greyhound association.\n\n(6) Terms concerning contracts entered into for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering at the racetrack prior to the live racing cessation date, as provided in section 99D.9A, at the racetrack.\n\n(7) Any other related items concerning the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering at the dog racetrack and the operation of the dog racetrack facility.\n\nc. (1) If the parties are unable to reach agreement on any of the terms of the initial lease agreement by October 1, 2014, or to reach agreement on the fair market rental rate for purposes of the one five-year lease renewal by June 30, 2018, if the Iowa greyhound association requests arbitration concerning the renewal by June 18, 2018, the disputed terms of the lease shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American arbitration association as of the date for arbitration. A request for arbitration shall be in writing and a copy of the request shall be delivered to the other party. The parties shall each select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall choose a third arbitrator to complete the three-person arbitration panel. Each party shall deliver its final offer on each of the disputed items to the other party within fourteen days after the request for arbitration. After consultation with the parties, the arbitrators shall set a time and place for an arbitration hearing. The parties may continue to negotiate all offers until an agreement is reached or a decision is rendered by the arbitrators. For purposes of determining the fair market rental rate for purposes of the one five-year lease renewal, either party may argue, and present arguments and evidence, that the renewal lease rental rate should be based upon the market value of similarly situated undeveloped land, or upon its use as a greyhound track. The submission of the disputed items to the arbitrators shall be limited to those items upon which the parties have not reached agreement. However, the arbitrators shall have no authority to extend the term of the lease agreement beyond the initial five-year term or the one five-year renewal.\n\n(2) The arbitrators shall render a decision within fifteen days after the hearing. The arbitrators shall give written explanation for the decision and the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, and any decision of the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The decision by the arbitrators and the items agreed upon by the parties shall be deemed to be the lease agreement between the parties and such final lease agreement shall not be subject to the approval of the governing body of the city of Dubuque, the Iowa greyhound association, the commission, or any other government body. Each party to the arbitration shall bear its own expenses, including attorney fees, and the parties shall share equally the filing and other administrative fees of the American arbitration association and the expenses of the arbitrators.\n\n2014 Acts, ch 1126, §4\n\nReferred to in §99D.9, 99D.9B, 99D.10, 99D.11, 99D.20",

For exotic wagering involving three or more horses or dogs, the commission shall authorize at the request of the licensee a deduction of a higher or lower percent of the total sum wagered not to exceed twenty-five percent on the exotic wagers. The additional deduction authorized above twenty-two percent on the multiple or exotic wagers involving more than two horses or dogs shall be retained by the licensee. One percent of the exotic wagers on three or more horses or dogs shall be distributed as provided in section 99D.12.\n\n6. a. All wagering shall be conducted within the racetrack enclosure where the licensed race is held, except as provided in paragraphs “b” and “c”.\n\nb. (1) The commission may authorize the licensee to simultaneously telecast within the racetrack enclosure or at the facility of a licensee authorized to operate an excursion gambling boat or gambling structure under chapter 99F, for the purpose of pari-mutuel wagering, a horse or dog race licensed by the racing authority of another state or foreign jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of each licensee to obtain the consent of appropriate racing officials in other states as required by the federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. §3001 – 3007, to televise races for the purpose of conducting pari-mutuel wagering.\n\n(2) A licensee may also obtain the permission of a person licensed by the commission to conduct horse or dog races in this state to televise races conducted by that person for the purpose of conducting pari-mutuel wagering. However, arrangements made by a licensee to televise any race for the purpose of conducting pari-mutuel wagering are subject to the approval of the commission, and the commission shall select the races to be televised. The races selected by the commission shall be the same for all licensees approved by the commission to televise races for the purpose of conducting pari-mutuel wagering. Except for a licensee that is not obligated to schedule performances of live races pursuant to section 99D.9A, or a licensee issued a license subject to the requirements of section 99D.9C, the commission shall not authorize the simultaneous telecast or televising of and a licensee shall not simultaneously telecast or televise any horse or dog race for the purpose of conducting pari-mutuel wagering unless the simultaneous telecast or televising is done at the racetrack of a licensee that schedules no less than sixty performances of nine live races each day of the season.\n\n(3) For purposes of the taxes imposed under this chapter, races televised by a licensee for purposes of pari-mutuel wagering shall be treated as if the races were held by the licensee. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this chapter, the commission may allow a licensee to adopt the same deductions as those of the pari-mutuel racetrack from which the races are being simultaneously telecast.\n\nc. (1) The commission shall authorize the licensee of the horse racetrack located in Polk county to conduct advance deposit wagering. An advance deposit wager may be placed in person at a licensed racetrack enclosure, or from any other location via a telephone-type device or any other electronic means. The commission may also issue an advance deposit wagering operator license to an entity who complies with subparagraph (3) and section 99D.8A.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, “advance deposit wagering” means a method of pari-mutuel wagering in which an individual may establish an account, deposit money into the account, and use the account balance to pay for pari-mutuel wagering. Of the net revenue, less all taxes paid and expenses directly related to account deposit wagering incurred by the licensee of the horse racetrack located in Polk county, received through advance deposit wagering, fifty percent shall be designated for the horse purses created pursuant to section 99D.7, subsection 5, and fifty percent shall be designated for the licensee for the pari-mutuel horse racetrack located in Polk county.\n\n(3) Before granting an advance deposit wagering operator license to an entity other than the licensee of the horse racetrack located in Polk county, the commission shall enter into an agreement with the licensee of the horse racetrack located in Polk county, the Iowa horsemen’s benevolent and protective association, and the prospective advance deposit wagering operator for the purpose of determining the payment of statewide source market fees and the host fees to be paid on all races subject to advance deposit wagering. The commission shall establish the term of such an advance deposit wagering operator license. Such an advance deposit wagering operator licensee shall accept wagers on live races conducted at the horse racetrack in Polk county from all of its account holders if it accepts wagers from any residents of this state.\n\n(4) An unlicensed advance deposit wagering operator or an individual taking or receiving wagers from residents of this state is guilty of a class “D” felony.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this paragraph “c”, “advance deposit wagering operator” means an advance deposit wagering operator licensed by the commission who has entered into an agreement with the licensee of the horse racetrack in Polk county and the Iowa horsemen’s benevolent and protective association to provide advance deposit wagering.\n\n7. A person under the age of twenty-one years shall not make or attempt to make a pari-mutuel wager. A person who violates this subsection commits a scheduled violation under section 805.8C, subsection 5, paragraph “a”.\n\n83 Acts, ch 187, §11; 84 Acts, ch 1266, §11 – 13; 89 Acts, ch 216, §1; 90 Acts, ch 1175, §5; 90 Acts, ch 1261, §31; 91 Acts, ch 166, §2, 3; 92 Acts, ch 1163, §23; 92 Acts, ch 1203, §3, 4; 92 Acts, ch 1207, §1; 94 Acts, ch 1021, §3, 4; 96 Acts, ch 1211, §32; 2004 Acts, ch 1136, §12; 2005 Acts, ch 3, §25; 2009 Acts, ch 88, §1; 2011 Acts, ch 111, §4 – 7; 2012 Acts, ch 1023, §19, 20; 2014 Acts, ch 1033, §2; 2014 Acts, ch 1126, §6; 2021 Acts, ch 156, §1\n\nReferred to in §99D.2, 99D.7, 99D.9, 99D.10, 99D.13, 99D.16, 99D.24, 99F.4, 805.8C(5)(a)",

(1) A licensee shall hold at least one race on each racing day limited to Iowa-foaled horses or Iowa-whelped dogs as defined by the department of agriculture and land stewardship using standards consistent with this section. However, if sufficient competition cannot be had among that class of horses or dogs on any day, another race for the day may be substituted.\n\n(2) If Iowa-foaled horses are in a race not limited to Iowa-foaled horses that is not a stakes race, the licensee shall allow any Iowa-foaled horse an additional three-pound weight allowance beyond the stated conditions of the race.\n\nb. A sum equal to twelve percent of the purse won by an Iowa-foaled horse or Iowa-whelped dog shall be used to promote the horse and dog breeding industries. The twelve percent shall be withheld by the licensee from the breakage and shall be paid at the end of the race meeting to the state department of agriculture and land stewardship which in turn shall deposit it in a special fund to be known as the Iowa horse and dog breeders fund. The department shall pay the amount deposited in the fund that is withheld from the purse won by an Iowa-foaled horse to the breeder of the winning Iowa-foaled horse by December 31 of each calendar year. The department shall pay the amount deposited in the fund that is withheld from the purse won by an Iowa-whelped dog to the breeder of the winning Iowa-whelped dog by March 31 of each calendar year. For the purposes of this section, the breeder of a horse shall be considered to be the owner of the brood mare at the time the foal is dropped.\n\nc. No less than twenty percent of all net purse moneys distributed to each breed, as described in section 99D.7, subsection 5, paragraph “b”, shall be designated for registered Iowa-bred foals in the form of breeder’s awards or purse supplement awards to enhance and foster the growth of the horse breeding industry.\n\n2. For the purposes of this chapter, the following shall be considered in determining if a horse is an Iowa-foaled thoroughbred horse, quarter horse, or standardbred horse:\n\na. All thoroughbred horses, quarter horses, or standardbred horses foaled in Iowa which are registered by the jockey club, American quarter horse association, or United States trotting association as Iowa foaled shall be considered to be Iowa foaled.\n\nb. Eligibility for brood mare residence shall be achieved by meeting at least one of the following rules:\n\n(1) Thirty days residency until the foal is inspected, if in foal to a registered Iowa stallion.\n\n(2) Thirty days residency until the foal is inspected for brood mares which are bred back to registered Iowa stallions.\n\n(3) Continuous residency from December 31 until the foal is inspected if the mare was bred by other than an Iowa registered stallion and is not bred back to an Iowa registered stallion.\n\nc. To be eligible for registration as an Iowa thoroughbred, quarter horse, or standardbred stallion, stallion residency from January 1 through July 31 for the year of registration shall be met. However, horses going to stud for the first year shall be eligible upon registration with residency to continue through July 31.\n\nd. State residency shall not be required for owners of brood mares.\n\n3. To facilitate the implementation of this section, the department of agriculture and land stewardship shall do all of the following:\n\na. Adopt standards to qualify thoroughbred, quarter horse, or standardbred stallions for Iowa breeding. A stallion shall stand for service in the state at the time of the foal’s conception and shall not stand for service at any place outside the state during the calendar year in which the foal is conceived.\n\nb. Provide for the registration of Iowa-foaled horses and that a horse shall not compete in a race limited to Iowa-foaled horses unless the horse is registered with the department of agriculture and land stewardship. The department may prescribe such forms as necessary to determine the eligibility of a horse.\n\nc. The secretary of agriculture shall appoint investigators to determine the eligibility for registration of Iowa-foaled horses.\n\nd. Establish a registration fee imposed on each horse which is a thoroughbred, quarter horse, or standardbred which shall be paid by the breeder of the horse. The department shall not impose the registration fee more than once on each horse. The amount of the registration fee shall not exceed thirty dollars. The moneys paid to the department from registration fees shall be considered repayment receipts as defined in section 8.2, and shall be used for the administration and enforcement of this subsection.\n\n4. a. The department of agriculture and land stewardship shall adopt rules establishing a schedule of registration fees to be imposed on owners of dogs that are whelped and raised for the first six months of their lives in Iowa for purposes of promoting native dogs as provided in this chapter, including section 99D.12 and this section. The amount of the registration fees shall be imposed as follows:\n\n(1) An owner of a dam registering the dam, twenty-five dollars.\n\n(2) An owner of a litter registering the litter, ten dollars.\n\n(3) An owner of a dog registering the dog, five dollars.\n\nb. The moneys paid to the department from registration fees as provided in paragraph “a” shall be considered repayment receipts as defined in section 8.2, and shall be used for the administration and enforcement of programs for the promotion of native dogs.\n\n5. To qualify for the Iowa horse and dog breeders fund, a dog shall have been whelped in Iowa and raised for the first six months of its life in Iowa in a state inspected licensed facility. In addition, the owner of the dog shall have been a resident of the state for at least two years prior to the whelping.

      "text": "99D.25 Drugging or numbing — exception — tests — reports — penalties.\n\n1. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Drugging” means administering to a horse or dog any substance foreign to the natural horse or dog prior to the start of a race. However, in counties with a population of two hundred fifty thousand or more, “drugging” does not include administering to a horse the drugs furosemide and phenylbutazone in accordance with section 99D.25A and rules adopted by the commission.\n\nb. “Numbing” means the applying of a freezing device or substance to the limbs of a horse or dog within two hours before the start of a race, or a surgical or other procedure which was, at any time, performed in which the nerves of a horse or dog were severed, destroyed, injected, or removed. For purposes of this paragraph, ice is not a freezing device or substance.\n\nc. “Entered” means that a horse or dog has been registered as a participant in a specified race, and not withdrawn prior to presentation of the horse or dog for inspection and testing.\n\n2. The general assembly finds that the practice of drugging or numbing a horse or dog prior to a race:\n\na. Corrupts the integrity of the sport of racing and promotes criminal fraud in the sport;\n\nb. Misleads the wagering public and those desiring to purchase a horse or dog as to the condition and ability of the horse or dog;\n\nc. Poses an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to the rider of a horse and to the riders of other horses competing in the same race; and\n\nd. Is cruel and inhumane to the horse or dog so drugged or numbed.\n\n3. The following conduct is prohibited:\n\na. The entering of a horse or dog in a race by the trainer or owner of the horse or dog if the trainer or owner knows or if by the exercise of reasonable care the trainer or owner should know that the horse or dog is drugged or numbed;\n\nb. The drugging or numbing of a horse or dog with knowledge or with reason to believe that the horse or dog will compete in a race while so drugged or numbed. However, the commission may by rule establish permissible trace levels of substances foreign to the natural horse or dog that the commission determines to be innocuous;\n\nc. The willful failure by the operator of a racing facility to disqualify a horse or dog from competing in a race if the operator has been notified that the horse or dog is drugged or numbed, or was not properly made available for tests or inspections as required by the commission; and\n\nd. The willful failure by the operator of a racing facility to prohibit a horse or dog from racing if the operator has been notified that the horse or dog has been suspended from racing.\n\n4. The owners of a horse or dog and their agents and employees shall permit a member of the commission or a person employed or appointed by the commission to make tests as the commission deems proper in order to determine whether a horse or dog has been improperly drugged. The fact that purse money has been distributed prior to the issuance of a test report shall not be deemed a finding that no chemical substance has been administered unlawfully to the horse or dog earning the purse money. The findings of the commission that a horse or dog has been improperly drugged by a narcotic or other drug are prima facie evidence of the fact. The results of the tests shall be kept on file by the commission for at least one year following the tests.\n\n5. Every horse which suffers a breakdown on the racetrack, in training, or in competition, and is destroyed, and every other horse which expires while stabled on the racetrack under the jurisdiction of the commission, shall undergo a postmortem examination by a veterinarian or a veterinary pathologist at a time and place acceptable to the commission veterinarian to determine the injury or sickness which resulted in euthanasia or natural death. Test samples may be obtained from the carcass upon which the postmortem examination is conducted and shall be sent to a laboratory approved by the commission for testing for foreign substances and natural substances at abnormal levels. When practical, blood and urine test samples should be procured prior to euthanasia. The owner of the deceased horse is responsible for payment of any charges due to conduct the postmortem examination. A record of every postmortem shall be filed with the commission by the veterinarian or veterinary pathologist who performed the postmortem within seventy-two hours of the death. Each owner and trainer accepts the responsibility for the postmortem examination provided herein as a requisite for maintaining the occupational license issued by the commission.\n\n6. Any horse which in the opinion of the commission veterinarian has suffered a traumatic injury or disability such that a controlled program of phenylbutazone administration would not aid in restoring the racing soundness of the horse shall not be allowed to race while medicated with phenylbutazone or with phenylbutazone present in the horse’s bodily systems.\n\n7. A person found within or in the immediate vicinity of a security stall who is in possession of unauthorized drugs or hypodermic needles or who is not authorized to possess drugs or hypodermic needles shall, in addition to any other penalties, be barred from entry into any racetrack in Iowa and any occupational license the person holds shall be revoked.\n\n8. Before a horse is allowed to race using phenylbutazone, the veterinarian attending the horse shall certify to the commission the course of treatment followed in administering the phenylbutazone.\n\n9. The commission shall conduct random tests of bodily substances of horses entered to race each day of a race meeting to aid in the detection of any unlawful drugging. The tests may be conducted both prior to and after a race. The commission may also test any horse that breaks down during a race and shall perform an autopsy on any horse that is killed or subsequently destroyed as a result of an accident during a race. When practical, blood and urine test samples should be procured prior to euthanasia.\n\n10. Veterinarians must submit daily to the commission veterinarian on a prescribed form a report of all medications and other substances which the veterinarian prescribed, administered, or dispensed for horses registered at a current race meeting. A logbook detailing other professional services performed while on the grounds of a racetrack shall be kept by veterinarians and shall be made immediately available to the commission veterinarian or the stewards upon request.\n\n11.

As used in this section unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Bleeder” means, according to its context, any of the following:\n\n(1) A horse which, during a race or exercise, is observed by the commission veterinarian or a licensed practicing veterinarian to be shedding blood from one or both nostrils and in which no upper airway injury is noted during an examination by the commission veterinarian or a licensed practicing veterinarian immediately following such a race or exercise.\n\n(2) A horse which, within one and one-half hours of such a race or exercise, is observed by the commission veterinarian or a licensed practicing veterinarian, through visual or endoscopic examination, to be shedding blood from the lower airway.\n\n(3) A horse which has been certified as a bleeder in another state.\n\n(4) A horse which has furosemide listed on its most recent past performance.\n\n(5) A horse which, by recommendation of a licensed practicing veterinarian, is prescribed furosemide to control or prevent bleeding from the lungs.\n\nb. “Bleeder list” means a tabulation of all bleeders maintained by the commission veterinarian.\n\nc. “Detention barn” means a secured structure designated by the commission.\n\n2. Phenylbutazone may be administered to a horse in dosage amounts as set by rule by the commission.\n\n3. If a horse is to race with phenylbutazone in its system, the trainer, or trainer’s designee, shall be responsible for marking the information on the entry blank for each race in which the horse shall use phenylbutazone. Changes made after the time of entry must be submitted on the prescribed form to the commission veterinarian no later than scratch time.\n\n4. If a test detects concentrations of phenylbutazone in the system of a horse in excess of the level permitted in this section, the commission shall assess a civil penalty against the trainer of at least two hundred dollars for the first offense and at least five hundred dollars for a second offense. The penalty for a third or subsequent offense shall be in the discretion of the commission.\n\n5. Furosemide may be administered to certified bleeders. Upon request, any horse placed on the bleeder list shall, in its next race, be permitted the use of furosemide. Once a horse has raced with furosemide, it must continue to race with furosemide in all subsequent races unless a request is made to discontinue the use. If the use of furosemide is discontinued, the horse shall be prohibited from again racing with furosemide unless it is later observed to be bleeding. Requests for the use of or discontinuance of furosemide must be made to the commission veterinarian by the horse’s trainer or assistant trainer on a form prescribed by the commission on or before the day of entry into the race for which the request is made.\n\n6. Once a horse has been permitted the use of furosemide, the horse must be treated with furosemide in the horse’s stall, unless the commission provides that a horse must be brought to the detention barn for treatment. After the furosemide treatment, the commission, by rule, may authorize the release of the horse from the horse’s stall or detention barn before the scheduled post time. If a horse is brought to the detention barn late, the commission shall assess a civil penalty of one hundred dollars against the trainer.\n\n7. A horse entered to race with furosemide must be treated at least four hours prior to post time. The furosemide shall be administered intravenously by a veterinarian issued a current occupational license by the commission. The commission shall adopt rules to ensure that furosemide is administered as provided in this section. The commission shall require that the veterinarian deliver an affidavit signed by the veterinarian which certifies information regarding the treatment of the horse. The affidavit must be delivered to a commission veterinarian following the treatment. The affidavit must at least include the name of the veterinarian, the tattoo number of the horse, the location of the barn and stall where the treatment occurred, the race number of the horse, the name of the trainer, and the time that the furosemide was administered. Furosemide shall only be administered in a dose level of no less than one hundred fifty milligrams and no more than five hundred milligrams.\n\n8. A person found within or in the immediate vicinity of the detention barn or horse stall who is in possession of unauthorized drugs or hypodermic needles or who is not authorized to possess drugs or hypodermic needles shall, in addition to any other penalties, be barred from entry into any racetrack in Iowa and any occupational license the person holds shall be revoked.\n\n88 Acts, ch 1137, §13; 92 Acts, ch 1203, §11; 94 Acts, ch 1100, §5; 97 Acts, ch 23, §12; 98 Acts, ch 1006, §1, 2; 98 Acts, ch 1217, §10; 2004 Acts, ch 1136, §23; 2007 Acts, ch 48, §2 – 5, 7; 2014 Acts, ch 1033, §3; 2017 Acts, ch 73, §2, 4\n\nReferred to in §99D.25",
