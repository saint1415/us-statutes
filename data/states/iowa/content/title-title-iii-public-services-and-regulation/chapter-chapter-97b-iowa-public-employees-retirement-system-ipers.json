The highest three years of a member’s covered wages shall be determined using calendar years. However, if a member’s final quarter of a year of employment does not occur at the end of a calendar year, the system may determine the wages for the third year by computing the average quarter of all quarters from the member’s highest calendar year of covered wages not being used in the selection of the two highest years and using the computed average quarter for each quarter in the third year in which no wages have been reported in combination with the final quarter or quarters of the member’s service to create a full year. However, the system shall not use the member’s final quarter of wages if using that quarter would reduce the member’s three-year average covered wage. If the three-year average covered wage of a member exceeds the highest maximum covered wages in effect for a calendar year during the member’s period of service, the three-year average covered wage of the member shall be reduced to the highest maximum covered wages in effect during the member’s period of service.

The member’s applicable calendar year wages shall be the member’s highest calendar year of covered wages not used in the calculation of the member’s three-year average covered wage pursuant to paragraph “a”, or such other calendar year of covered wages selected by the system pursuant to rules adopted by the system.\n\n25. a. “Vested member” means a member who has attained through age or sufficient years of service eligibility to receive monthly retirement benefits upon the member’s retirement.

The system shall establish and maintain records of each member, including but not limited to the amount of wages of each member, the contributions made on behalf of each member with interest, interest dividends credited, beneficiary designations, and applications for benefits of any type. The records may be maintained in paper, magnetic, or electronic form, including optical disk storage, as set forth in chapter 554D. The system may accept, but shall not require, electronic records and electronic signatures to the extent permitted under chapter 554D. These records are the basis for the compilation of the retirement benefits provided under this chapter.\n\n2. The following records maintained under this chapter are not public records for the purposes of chapter 22:\n\na. Records containing social security numbers.\n\nb. Records specifying amounts accumulated in members’ accounts and supplemental accounts.\n\nc. Records containing names or addresses of members or their beneficiaries.\n\nd. Records containing amounts of payments to members or their beneficiaries.\n\ne. Records containing financial or commercial information that relates to the investment of retirement system funds if the disclosure of such information could result in a loss to the retirement system or to the provider of the information.\n\n3. Summary information concerning the demographics of the members and general statistical information concerning the retirement system are subject to chapter 22, as well as aggregate information by category.\n\n4. a. The system’s records are evidence for the purpose of proceedings before the system or any court of the amounts of wages and the periods in which they were paid, and the absence of an entry as to a member’s wages in the records for any period is evidence that wages were not paid that member in the period.\n\nb. Notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 22 to the contrary, the system’s records may be released to any political subdivision, instrumentality, or other agency of the state solely for use in a civil or criminal law enforcement activity pursuant to the requirements of this subsection. To obtain the records, the political subdivision, instrumentality, or agency shall, in writing, certify that the activity is authorized by law, provide a written description of the information desired, and describe the law enforcement activity for which the information is sought. The system shall not be civilly or criminally liable for the release or rerelease of records in accordance with this subsection.\n\n5. Confidential records of the system maintained for the operation of the retirement system may be released to the directors, agents, and employees of the legislative services agency, the department of revenue, the department of management, the department of administrative services, or an employer of employees covered by the retirement system pursuant to rules adopted by the system for the performance of the requestor’s duties. To obtain a record under this subsection, the person requesting the records shall provide a written description of the information requested and the reason for requesting the records to the system. A person receiving a record pursuant to this subsection shall maintain the confidentiality of any information otherwise required to be kept confidential and shall be subject to the same penalties as the custodian of the records for the public dissemination of such information.\n\n[C46, 50, §97.25 – 97.27; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §97B.17]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1242, §19; 92 Acts, ch 1201, §15; 96 Acts, ch 1187, §7, 8; 98 Acts, ch 1183, §14; 2000 Acts, ch 1077, §26; 2001 Acts, ch 68, §21, 24; 2002 Acts, ch 1135, §13; 2003 Acts, ch 35, §45, 49; 2003 Acts, ch 44, §30; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §15",

If the monthly increase in retirement benefits is less than ten dollars, the system shall retain five dollars of the scheduled increase, and if the monthly increase is less than five dollars, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply. The system shall continue to retain such funds until the withdrawn contributions, together with interest accrued to the month in which the written election is filed, have been repaid. Due notice of this provision shall be sent to all retired members on or after July 1, 1978. However, this subsection shall not apply to any person who received a refund of any membership service contributions unless the person repaid the membership service contributions pursuant to section 97B.80C; but a refund of contributions remitted for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 1953, which was based entirely upon employment which terminated prior to July 4, 1953, shall not be considered as a refund of membership service contributions. The interest to be paid into the fund shall be compounded at the rates credited to member accounts from the date of payment of the refund of contributions under the abolished system to the date the member redeposits the refunded amount. The provisions of subsection 1 relating to the consideration given to credited amounts shall apply to the redeposited amounts or to amounts left on deposit. Effective July 1, 1978, the provisions of this subsection shall apply to each individual who on or after July 1, 1978, was an active, vested, or retired member, but who was not in service on July 4, 1953. The period for filing the written election with the system and redepositing any withdrawn contributions together with interest accrued shall commence July 1, 1978. A member who is a retired member on or after July 1, 1978, may file written election with the system on or after July 1, 1978, to have the system retain fifty percent of the monthly increase as provided in this subsection.\n\n4. Effective July 1, 2004, a member eligible for an increased retirement allowance because of the repayment of contributions under this section is entitled to receipt of adjustment payments beginning with the month in which payment was received by the system.\n\n[C46, 50, §97.13, 97.45; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §97B.43]\n\n88 Acts, ch 1123, §1; 88 Acts, ch 1242, §31; 90 Acts, ch 1240, §25; 92 Acts, ch 1201, §38; 98 Acts, ch 1183, §26, 82; 2001 Acts, ch 68, §21, 24; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §175, 286; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §21, 22; 2016 Acts, ch 1011, §32; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §53\n\nReferred to in §97B.49A, 97B.68",

Receipt of the lump sum payment by a member shall terminate any and all entitlement for the period of service covered of the member under this chapter and the member shall not be eligible to buy back the period of service.\n\n2. The first monthly payment of a retirement allowance shall be paid as of the member’s first month of entitlement. The payments shall be continued thereafter for the lifetime of the retired member except as provided in section 97B.48A.\n\n3. On or before the first of the month in which a member attains the age of seventy years, the system shall provide written notification to each member for whom the system has an address that the member may commence receiving a retirement allowance regardless of the member’s employment status. Prior to receiving a retirement allowance pursuant to this subsection, a member shall acknowledge in writing that the member was informed by the system of the consequences of electing to receive a retirement allowance pursuant to this subsection and that receipt of a retirement allowance under this subsection is optional. Upon termination from employment of a member receiving a retirement allowance pursuant to this subsection, the member is entitled to have the member’s monthly retirement allowance recalculated using the applicable formula for determining a retirement allowance pursuant to sections 97B.49A through 97B.49G, as applicable, in place at the time of the member’s first month of entitlement.\n\n4. Payment of a member’s retirement allowance pursuant to sections 97B.49A through 97B.49H shall commence no later than the required beginning date specified under section 401(a)(9) of the federal Internal Revenue Code regardless of whether the member has submitted the appropriate notice to receive an allowance. If the lump sum actuarial equivalent under subsection 1 could have been selected by the member, payments shall be made in a lump sum rather than as a monthly allowance.\n\n5. Effective on such date as the system determines by rule, but in no event later than July 1, 2006, if the system determines that the lump sum amount payable to a living member who has had a break in service or to a beneficiary of a deceased member is less than the current maximum amount prescribed by the internal revenue service that may be distributed without triggering automatic rollover rights, the lump sum amount payable under this chapter shall be paid to the living member or beneficiary in full satisfaction of all rights of the member or beneficiary to receive any payments under the system. For purposes of this section, a “break in service” means twenty consecutive calendar quarters in which no wages are reported to the system. The lump sum payment shall be made within one hundred eighty days after the calendar quarter in which the member completes a break in service or dies, whichever is applicable. A member or beneficiary who receives a mandatory distribution under this subsection shall have sixty days to return the distribution to the system and restore the member’s or beneficiary’s account.\n\n6. Effective July 1, 2005, monthly retirement allowance payments shall be directly deposited without charge to a retired member’s account via electronic funds transfer. A retired member may elect to receive monthly allowance payments as paper warrants in lieu of electronic funds transfers, but the system shall charge an administrative fee for processing such paper warrants.

If a member who has not reached the member’s sixty-fifth birthday and who has a bona fide retirement under this chapter is in regular full-time employment during a calendar year, the member’s retirement allowance shall be reduced by fifty cents for each dollar the member earns over the limit provided in this subsection. However, employment is not full-time employment until the member receives remuneration in an amount in excess of fifty thousand dollars for a calendar year, or an amount equal to the amount of remuneration permitted for a calendar year for persons under sixty-five years of age before a reduction in federal social security retirement benefits is required, whichever is higher. Effective the first of the month in which a member attains the age of sixty-five years, a retired member may receive a retirement allowance without a reduction after return to covered employment regardless of the amount of remuneration received.\n\nb. If a member dies and the full amount of the reduction from retirement allowances required under this subsection has not been paid, the remaining amounts shall be deducted from the payments made, if any, to the member’s designated beneficiary or contingent annuitant. If the member has selected an option under which remaining payments are not required or the remaining payments are insufficient to satisfy the full amount of the reduction from retirement allowances required under this subsection, the amount still unpaid shall be a claim against the member’s estate.\n\nc. For purposes of this subsection and not for purposes of determining a retiree’s covered wages, remuneration paid on and after July 1, 2007, includes noncovered contributions to a defined contribution plan qualified under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a), a tax-deferred annuity qualified under Internal Revenue Code section 403(b), an eligible deferred compensation plan qualified under Internal Revenue Code section 457, or any other tax qualified or nonqualified investment vehicle, that is provided by an employer to a retiree who has been or will be reemployed in covered employment.\n\n2. Effective January 1, 1991, a retired member of any age may receive a retirement allowance after return to covered employment, regardless of the amount of remuneration received, if the covered employment consists of holding an elective office.\n\n3. Upon a retirement after reemployment, a retired member may have the retired member’s retirement allowance redetermined under this section or section 97B.48, section 97B.50, or section 97B.51, whichever is applicable, based upon the addition of credit for the years of membership service of the employee after reemployment, the covered wage during reemployment, and the age of the employee after reemployment. The member shall receive a single retirement allowance calculated from both periods of membership service, one based on the initial retirement and one based on the second retirement following reemployment. If the total years of membership service and prior service of a member who has been reemployed equals or exceeds thirty, the years of membership service on which the original retirement allowance was based may be reduced by a fraction of the years of service equal to the number of years by which the total years of membership service and prior service exceeds thirty divided by thirty, if this reduction in years of service will increase the total retirement allowance of the member. The additional retirement allowance calculated for the period of reemployment shall be added to the retirement allowance calculated for the initial period of membership service and prior service, adjusted as provided in this subsection. The retirement allowance calculated for the initial period of membership service and prior service shall not be adjusted for any other factor than years of service. The retired member shall not receive a retirement allowance based upon more than a total of thirty years of service. Effective July 1, 1998, a redetermination of a retirement allowance as authorized by this subsection for a retired member whose combined service exceeds the applicable years of service for that member as provided in sections 97B.49A through 97B.49G shall have the determination of the member’s reemployment benefit based upon the percentage multiplier as determined for that member as provided in sections 97B.49A through 97B.49G.\n\n4. The system shall pay to the member the accumulated contributions of the member and all of the employer contributions, plus interest plus interest dividends as provided in section 97B.70, for all completed calendar years, compounded as provided in section 97B.70, on the covered wages earned by a retired member that are not used in the recalculation of the retirement allowance of a member. A payment of contributions to a member pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a retirement payment and not a refund and the member shall not be eligible to buy back the period of reemployment service.\n\n5. If a retired reemployed member incurs a break in service, as defined in this subsection, and the member has failed to request an increase in the member’s monthly allowance or a distribution of the member’s and employer’s accumulated contributions prior to the break in service, and if the amount of the increase in the member’s monthly retirement allowance would be less than six hundred dollars per year, the system shall distribute the lump sum amount payable under subsection 4. For purposes of this subsection, a “break in service” means four consecutive calendar quarters in which no wages are reported to the system. The lump sum payment shall be made within one hundred eighty days after the calendar quarter in which the member has a break in service. A member who receives a mandatory distribution under this subsection shall have sixty days to return the distribution to the system and request an increase in the member’s monthly allowance.\n\n92 Acts, ch 1201, §42; 96 Acts, ch 1187, §28, 29; 98 Acts, ch 1183, §32 – 34; 2000 Acts, ch 1077, §33 – 35; 2001 Acts, ch 68, §21, 24; 2002 Acts, ch 1135, §19; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §29; 2006 Acts, ch 1091, §5; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2022 Acts, ch 1006, §1, 3\n\nReferred to in §97B.1A, 97B.48, 97B.50A, 97B.52A",

Entitlement to monthly allowance. Each member, upon retirement on or after the member’s normal retirement date, is entitled to receive a monthly retirement allowance determined under this section. For an inactive vested member the monthly retirement allowance shall be determined on the basis of this section and section 97B.50 as they are in effect on the date of the member’s retirement.\n\n3. Calculation of monthly allowance. For each active or inactive vested member retiring on or after July 1, 1994, who is vested by service, a monthly benefit shall be computed which is equal to one-twelfth of an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the final average covered wage multiplied by a fraction of years of service.

The amount of the monthly formula benefit for each such active or vested member who retired on or after January 1, 1976, shall be equal to one-twelfth of one and fifty-seven hundredths percent per year of membership service multiplied by the member’s average annual covered wages. In no case shall the amount of monthly formula benefit accrued for membership service prior to July 1, 1967, be less than the monthly annuity at the normal retirement date determined by applying the sum of the member’s accumulated contributions, the member’s employer’s accumulated contributions on or before June 30, 1967, and any retirement dividends standing to the member’s credit on or before December 31, 1966, to the annuity tables in use by the system with due regard to the benefits payable from such accumulated contributions under sections 97B.52 and 97B.53.\n\nb. For each member employed before January 1, 1976, who has qualified for prior service credit in accordance with section 97B.43, subsection 1, a formula benefit shall be determined equal to the larger of the benefit determined under this paragraph and paragraph “a” of this subsection, as applicable, the benefit determined under subsection 3, or the benefit determined under section 97B.49G, subsection 1. The amount of the monthly formula benefit under this paragraph shall be equal to eight-tenths of one percent per year of prior service credit multiplied by the monthly rate of the member’s total remuneration not in excess of three thousand dollars annually during the twelve consecutive months of the member’s prior service for which that total remuneration was the highest. An additional three-tenths of one percent of the remuneration not in excess of three thousand dollars annually shall be payable for prior service during each year in which the accrued liability for benefit payments created by the abolished system is funded by appropriation from the Iowa public employees’ retirement fund.\n\nc.

Effective July 1, 1997, commencing with dividends payable in November 1997, and for each subsequent year, all members who retired prior to July 1, 1990, and all beneficiaries and contingent annuitants of such members, shall be eligible for annual dividend payments, payable in November of that year, pursuant to the requirements of this subsection. The dividend payable in any given year shall be the sum of the dollar amount of the dividend payable in the previous November and the dividend adjustment. A dividend determined pursuant to this subsection shall not be used to increase the monthly benefit amount payable. In no event shall the dividend payable be less than twenty-five dollars.\n\nb. (1) The dividend adjustment for a given year shall be calculated by multiplying the total of the retiree’s, beneficiary’s, or contingent annuitant’s monthly benefit payments and the dividend payable to the retiree, beneficiary, or contingent annuitant, in the previous calendar year by the applicable percentage as determined by this paragraph.\n\n(2) The applicable percentage shall be the least of the following percentages:\n\n(a) The percentage representing the percentage increase in the consumer price index published in the federal register by the federal department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, that reflects the percentage increase in the consumer price index for the twelve-month period ending June 30 of the year that the dividend is to be paid.\n\n(b) The percentage representing the percentage amount the actuary has certified that the fund can absorb without requiring an increase in the employer and employee contributions to the fund. The actuary’s certification of such percentage amount shall be based on a comparison of the actuarially required contribution rate for the fiscal year of the dividend adjustment to the statutory contribution rate for that same fiscal year. If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the statutory contribution rate for that same fiscal year, the percentage amount shall be zero.\n\n(c) Three percent.\n\nc. If a member eligible to receive a cost-of-living dividend dies before November 1 of a year, a cost-of-living dividend shall not be payable in November of that year in the name of the member. If a member dies on or after November 1, but before payment of a dividend is made in that month, the full amount of the retirement dividend for that year shall be paid in the member’s name upon notification of the member’s death.\n\n2. Favorable experience dividend.\n\na. Commencing January 1, 1999, all qualified recipients who have received a monthly allowance for at least one year as of the date the dividend is payable shall be eligible to receive a favorable experience dividend, payable on the last business day in January of each year pursuant to the requirements of this subsection. If the qualified recipient eligible to receive a favorable experience dividend dies before January 1 of a year, a favorable experience dividend shall not be payable in January of that year in the name of the qualified recipient. However, if the qualified recipient dies on or after January 1 but before the dividend is paid in that month, the full amount of the dividend payable in that month shall be paid in the name of the qualified recipient, upon notification of death. For purposes of this paragraph, “qualified recipient” includes all members who retired on or after July 1, 1990, or a beneficiary or contingent annuitant of such a member who receives a monthly benefit, and a beneficiary of an active member who elects a monthly allowance under section 97B.52, subsection 1, paragraph “c”.\n\nb. A favorable experience dividend reserve account, hereafter called the “reserve account”, is established within the retirement fund. Moneys credited to the reserve account shall be used by the system for the purpose of providing a favorable experience dividend pursuant to this subsection.\n\nc. Moneys shall be credited to the reserve account in the retirement fund as follows:\n\n(1) On or before January 15, 1999, there shall be credited to the reserve account an amount that the system’s actuary determines is sufficient to pay the maximum favorable experience dividend for each of the next following five years, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions.\n\n(2) Beginning with the annual actuarial valuation of the retirement system as of June 30, 1999, and for each annual actuarial valuation of the retirement system thereafter, there shall be credited to the reserve account on each applicable January 15 following an actuarial valuation, an amount that represents that portion of the favorable actuarial experience, if any, that the system’s actuary determines shall be credited to the reserve account pursuant to rules adopted by the system.\n\n(3) The portion of the favorable actuarial experience, if any, that is not initially credited to the reserve account pursuant to subparagraph (2), but which, if applied to the retirement fund, would result in the actuarial valuation of assets exceeding the actuarial accrued liability of the retirement system based on the most recent annual actuarial valuation of the retirement system, shall be credited to the reserve account.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph to the contrary, moneys credited to the reserve account in any applicable year shall not exceed an amount which, if credited to the reserve account, would exceed an amount that the system’s actuary determines is sufficient to pay the maximum favorable experience dividend for each of the next following ten years, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any provisions of this paragraph to the contrary, moneys shall not be credited to the reserve account if the system is not fully funded or if the system would not remain fully funded if moneys were credited to the reserve account.\n\n(6) As used in this paragraph, “favorable actuarial experience” means the difference, if positive, between the anticipated and actual experience of the retirement system’s actuarial assets and liabilities as measured by the system’s actuary in the most recent annual actuarial valuation of the retirement system pursuant to rules adopted by the system.\n\nd. The favorable experience dividend is calculated by multiplying the monthly retirement allowance payable to the retiree, beneficiary, or contingent annuitant for the previous December, or such other month as determined by the system, by twelve, and then multiplying that amount by the number of complete years the member has been retired or would have been retired if living as of the date the dividend is payable, and by the applicable percentage.

However, the benefits shall be suspended during any period in which the member returns to covered employment. This section takes effect July 1, 1990, for a member meeting the requirements of this paragraph who retired from the retirement system at any time after July 4, 1953.

Eligible members retiring on or after July 1, 2000, are entitled to the receipt of retroactive adjustment payments for no more than thirty-six months immediately preceding the month in which written application for retirement due to disability was received by the system.\n\nc. A vested member who terminated service due to a disability, who has been issued payment for a refund pursuant to section 97B.53, and who subsequently commences receiving disability benefits as a result of that disability pursuant to the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §423 et seq. or the federal Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. §231 et seq., may receive credit for membership service for the period covered by the refund payment, upon repayment to the system of the actuarial cost of receiving service credit for the period covered by the refund payment, as determined by the system. For purposes of this paragraph, the actuarial cost of the service purchase shall be determined as provided in section 97B.80C. The payment to the system as provided in this paragraph shall be made within ninety days after July 1, 2000, or the date federal disability payments commenced, whichever occurs later. For purposes of this paragraph, the date federal disability payments commence shall be the date that the member actually receives the first such payment, regardless of any retroactive payments included in that payment. A member who repurchases service credit under this paragraph and applies for retirement benefits shall have the member’s monthly allowance, including retroactive adjustment payments, determined in the same manner as provided in paragraph “a” or “b”, as applicable.\n\nd.

If the vested member is under the age at which disability benefits are converted under the federal Social Security Act or the federal Railroad Retirement Act to retirement benefits and is no longer eligible for disability payments under either the federal Railroad Retirement Act or the federal Social Security Act, the vested member shall no longer be eligible to receive retirement benefits as provided by this subsection. If the system has paid retirement benefits to the member between the month the member was no longer eligible for payment pursuant to the federal Railroad Retirement Act or the federal Social Security Act and the month the system terminated retirement benefits under this paragraph, the member shall return all retirement benefits paid by the system following the termination of such federal disability benefits, plus interest.

      "text": "97B.50A Disability benefits for special service members.\n\n1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise provides:\n\na. “Member” means a vested member who is classified as a special service member under section 97B.1A, subsection 22, at the time of the alleged disability. “Member” does not mean a volunteer fire fighter.\n\nb. “Net disability retirement allowance” means the amount determined by subtracting the amount paid during the previous calendar year by the member for health insurance or similar health care coverage for the member and the member’s dependents from the amount of the member’s disability retirement allowance, including any dividends and distributions from supplemental accounts, paid for that year pursuant to this section.\n\nc. “Reemployment comparison amount” means an amount equal to the current covered wages of an active special service member at the same position on the salary scale within the rank or position the member held at the time the member received a disability retirement allowance pursuant to this section. If the rank or position held by the member at the time of retirement pursuant to this section is abolished, the amount shall be computed by the system as though the rank or position had not been abolished and salary increases had been granted on the same basis as granted to other ranks or positions by the former employer of the member. The reemployment comparison amount shall not be less than the three-year average covered wage of the member, based on all regular and special service covered under this chapter.\n\n2. In-service disability retirement allowance.\n\na. A member who is injured in the performance of the member’s duties, and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection, shall receive an in-service disability retirement allowance under this subsection, in lieu of a monthly retirement allowance as provided in section 97B.49A, 97B.49B, 97B.49C, 97B.49D, or 97B.49G, as applicable.\n\nb. Upon application of a member, a member who has become totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the member’s special service occupation as the natural and proximate result of an injury, disease, or exposure occurring or aggravated while in the actual performance of duty at some definite place and time shall be eligible to retire under this subsection, provided that the medical board, as established by this section, shall certify that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired. The system shall make the final determination, based on the medical evidence received, of a member’s total and permanent disability. However, if a person’s special service membership in the retirement system first commenced on or after July 1, 2000, the member shall not be eligible for benefits with respect to a disability which would not exist but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that membership commenced. A member who is denied a benefit under this subsection, by reason of a finding by the system that the member is not mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, shall be entitled to be restored to active service in the same or comparable special service occupation position held by the member immediately prior to the application for disability benefits.\n\nc. (1) Disease under this subsection shall mean heart disease or any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of strain, exposure, or the inhalation of noxious fumes, poison, or gases.\n\n(2) Disease under this subsection shall also mean cancer or infectious disease, as defined in section 411.1, and shall be presumed to have been contracted while on active duty as a result of that duty.\n\n(3) However, if a person’s special service membership in the retirement system first commenced on or after July 1, 2000, and the heart disease, disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, cancer, or infectious disease would not exist, but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that special service membership commenced, the presumption established in this paragraph “c” shall not apply.\n\nd. Upon retirement for an in-service disability as provided by this subsection, a member shall have the option to receive a monthly in-service disability retirement allowance calculated under this subsection or a monthly retirement allowance as provided in section 97B.49A, 97B.49B, 97B.49C, 97B.49D, or 97B.49G, as applicable, that the member would receive if the member had attained fifty-five years of age. The monthly in-service disability allowance calculated under this subsection shall consist of an allowance equal to one-twelfth of sixty percent of the member’s three-year average covered wage or its actuarial equivalent as provided under section 97B.51.\n\n3. Ordinary disability retirement allowance.\n\na. A member who otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection shall receive an ordinary disability retirement allowance under this subsection in lieu of a monthly retirement allowance as provided in section 97B.49A, 97B.49B, 97B.49C, 97B.49D, or 97B.49G, as applicable.\n\nb. Upon application of a member, a member who has become totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the member’s special service occupation shall be eligible to retire under this subsection, provided that the medical board, as established by this section, shall certify that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired. The system shall make the final determination, based on the medical evidence received, of a member’s total and permanent disability. However, if a person’s special service membership in the retirement system first commenced on or after July 1, 2000, the member shall not be eligible for benefits with respect to a disability which would not exist, but for a medical condition that was known to exist on the date that special service membership commenced. A member who is denied a benefit under this subsection, by reason of a finding by the system that the member is not mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, shall be entitled to be restored to active service in the same or comparable special service occupation position held by the member immediately prior to the application for disability benefits.\n\nc. Upon retirement for an ordinary disability as provided by this subsection, a member shall receive the greater of a monthly ordinary disability retirement allowance calculated under this subsection or a monthly retirement allowance as provided in section 97B.49A, 97B.49B, 97B.49C, 97B.49D, or 97B.49G, as applicable. The monthly ordinary disability allowance calculated under this subsection shall consist of an allowance equal to one-twelfth of fifty percent of the member’s three-year average covered wage or its actuarial equivalent as provided under section 97B.51.\n\n4. Waiver of allowance. A member receiving a disability retirement allowance under this section may file an application to receive benefits pursuant to section 97B.50, subsection 2, in lieu of receiving a disability retirement allowance under this section, if the member becomes eligible for benefits under section 97B.50, subsection 2. An application to receive benefits pursuant to section 97B.50, subsection 2, shall be filed with the system within sixty days after the member becomes eligible for benefits pursuant to that section or the member shall be ineligible to elect coverage under that section. On the first of the month following the month in which a member’s application is approved by the system, the member’s election of coverage under section 97B.50, subsection 2, shall become effective and the member’s eligibility to receive a disability retirement allowance pursuant to this section shall cease. Benefits payable pursuant to section 97B.50, subsection 2, shall be calculated using the option choice the member selected for payment of a disability retirement allowance pursuant to this section. An application to elect coverage under section 97B.50, subsection 2, is irrevocable upon approval by the system.\n\n5. Offset to allowance.\n\na. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in state law, or any applicable contract or policy, any amounts which may be paid or payable by the employer under any workers’ compensation, unemployment compensation, employer-paid disability plan, program, or policy, or other law to a member, and any disability payments the member receives pursuant to the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §423 et seq., shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any retirement allowance payable pursuant to this section on account of the same disability.\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, any workers’ compensation benefits received by a member for past medical expenses or future medical expenses shall not be offset against or considered payable in lieu of any retirement allowance payable pursuant to this section on account of the same disability.\n\nc. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, any workers’ compensation benefits received by a member for reimbursement of vacation time used, sick time used, or for any unpaid time off from work shall not be offset against or considered payable in lieu of any retirement allowance payable pursuant to this section on account of the same disability.\n\n6. Reexamination of members retired on account of disability.\n\na. Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member under this section, and once in every three-year period thereafter, the system may, and upon the member’s application shall, require any member receiving an in-service or ordinary disability retirement allowance who has not yet attained the age of fifty-five years to undergo a medical examination as arranged by the medical board as established by this section. The examination shall be made by the medical board or by an additional physician or physicians designated by the medical board. If any member receiving an in-service or ordinary disability retirement allowance who has not attained the age of fifty-five years refuses to submit to the medical examination, the allowance may be discontinued until the member’s withdrawal of the refusal, and should the member’s refusal continue for one year, all rights in and to the member’s disability retirement allowance shall be revoked by the system.\n\nb. If a member is determined under paragraph “a” to be no longer eligible for in-service or ordinary disability benefits, all benefits paid under this section shall cease. The member shall be eligible to receive benefits calculated under section 97B.49B or 97B.49C, as applicable, when the member reaches age fifty-five.\n\n7. Reemployment.\n\na. If a member receiving a disability retirement allowance is returned to covered employment, the member’s disability retirement allowance shall cease, the member shall again become an active member, and shall contribute thereafter at the same rate payable by similarly classified members. If a member receiving a disability retirement allowance returns to special service employment, then the period of time the member received a disability retirement allowance shall constitute eligible service as defined in section 97B.49B, subsection 1, or section 97B.49C, subsection 1, as applicable. Upon subsequent retirement, the member’s retirement allowance shall be calculated as provided in section 97B.48A.\n\nb. (1) If a member receiving a disability retirement allowance is engaged in a gainful occupation that is not covered employment, the member’s disability retirement allowance shall be reduced, if applicable, as provided in this paragraph.\n\n(2) If the member is engaged in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the member’s net disability retirement allowance and one and one-half times the reemployment comparison amount for that member, then the amount of the member’s disability retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount such that the member’s net disability retirement allowance plus the amount earned by the member shall equal one and one-half times the reemployment comparison amount for that member.\n\n(3) The member shall submit sufficient documentation to the system to permit the system to determine the member’s net disability retirement allowance and earnings from a gainful occupation that is not covered employment for the applicable year.\n\n(4) This paragraph does not apply to a member who is at least fifty-five years of age and would have completed a sufficient number of years of service if the member had remained in active special service employment. For purposes of this subparagraph, a sufficient number of years of service shall be the applicable years of service for a special service member as described in section 97B.49B or twenty-two for a special service member as described in section 97B.49C.\n\n8. Death benefits. A member who is receiving an in-service or ordinary disability retirement allowance under this section shall be treated as having elected a lifetime monthly retirement allowance with death benefits payable under section 97B.52, subsection 3, unless the member elects an optional form of benefit provided under section 97B.51, which shall be actuarially equivalent to the lifetime monthly retirement allowance provided under this section.\n\n9. Medical benefits. An employer shall furnish reasonable surgical, medical, dental, osteopathic, chiropractic, podiatric, physical rehabilitation, nursing, ambulance, and hospital services and supplies for a member who is injured in the performance of the member’s duties and is receiving an in-service disability retirement allowance under subsection 2 or has waived an in-service disability retirement allowance under subsection 4, regardless of when the injury occurred or when the member’s in-service disability allowance commenced.\n\n10. Medical board. The system shall designate a medical board to be composed of three physicians from the university of Iowa hospitals and clinics who shall arrange for and pass upon the medical examinations required under this section and shall report in writing to the system the conclusions and recommendations upon all matters duly referred to the medical board. Each report of a medical examination under this section shall include the medical board’s findings as to the extent of the member’s physical or mental impairment. Except as required by this section, each report shall be confidential and shall be maintained in accordance with the federal Americans With Disabilities Act, and any other state or federal law containing requirements for confidentiality of medical records.\n\n11. Liability of third parties — subrogation.\n\na. If a member receives an injury for which benefits are payable under this section, and if the injury is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability for damages against a third party other than the system, the member or the member’s legal representative may maintain an action for damages against the third party. If a member or a member’s legal representative commences such an action, the plaintiff member or representative shall serve a copy of the original notice upon the system not less than ten days before the trial of the action, but a failure to serve the notice does not prejudice the rights of the system, and the following rights and duties ensue:\n\n(1) The system shall be indemnified out of the recovery of damages to the extent of benefit payments made by the retirement system, with legal interest, except that the plaintiff member’s attorney fees may be first allowed by the district court.\n\n(2) The system has a lien on the damage claim against the third party and on any judgment on the damage claim for benefits for which the retirement system is liable. In order to continue and preserve the lien, the system shall file a notice of the lien within thirty days after receiving a copy of the original notice in the office of the clerk of the district court in which the action is filed.\n\nb. If a member fails to bring an action for damages against a third party within thirty days after the system requests the member in writing to do so, the system is subrogated to the rights of the member and may maintain the action against the third party, and may recover damages for the injury to the same extent that the member may recover damages for the injury. If the system recovers damages in the action, the court shall enter judgment for distribution of the recovery as follows:\n\n(1) A sum sufficient to repay the system for the amount of such benefits actually paid by the retirement system up to the time of the entering of the judgment.\n\n(2) A sum sufficient to pay the system the present worth, computed at the interest rate provided in section 535.3 for court judgments and decrees, of the future payments of such benefits for which the retirement system is liable, but the sum is not a final adjudication of the future payment which the member is entitled to receive.\n\n(3) Any balance shall be paid to the member.\n\nc. Before a settlement is effective between the system and a third party who is liable for any injury, the member must consent in writing to the settlement; and if the settlement is between the member and a third party, the system must consent in writing to the settlement; or on refusal to consent, in either case, the district court in the county in which either the employer of the member or the system is located must consent in writing to the settlement.\n\nd. For purposes of subrogation under this section, a payment made to an injured member or the member’s legal representative, by or on behalf of a third party or the third party’s principal or agent, who is liable for, connected with, or involved in causing the injury to the member, shall be considered paid as damages because the injury was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability against the third party, whether the payment is made under a covenant not to sue, compromise settlement, denial of liability, or is otherwise made.\n\n12. Document submissions. A member retired under this section, in order to be eligible for continued receipt of retirement benefits, shall submit to the system any documentation the system may reasonably request which will provide information needed to determine payments to the member under this section.\n\n13. Contributions. The expenses incurred in the administration of this section by the system shall be paid through contributions as determined pursuant to section 97B.11.\n\n14. Applicability — retroactivity.\n\na. This section applies to a member who becomes disabled on or after July 1, 2000, and also applies to a member who becomes disabled prior to July 1, 2000, if the member has not terminated special service employment as of June 30, 2000.\n\nb. To qualify for benefits under this section, a member must file a completed application with the system within one year of the member’s termination of employment. A member eligible for a disability retirement allowance under this section is entitled to receipt of retroactive adjustment payments for no more than six months immediately preceding the month in which the completed application for receipt of a disability retirement allowance under this section is approved.\n\n15. Rules. The system shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A specifying the application procedure for members pursuant to this section.\n\n2000 Acts, ch 1077, §51; 2001 Acts, ch 68, §21, 24; 2002 Acts, ch 1119, §126; 2002 Acts, ch 1135, §24; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1101, §17, 18; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §41; 2006 Acts, ch 1091, §9; 2008 Acts, ch 1171, §37, 48, 49; 2010 Acts, ch 1167, §31; 2021 Acts, ch 183, §28, 29; 2022 Acts, ch 1032, §31",

      "text": "97B.51 Allowance upon retirement.\n\n1. Each member has the right prior to the member’s retirement date to elect to have the member’s retirement allowance payable under one of the options set forth in this section. The amount of the optional retirement allowance selected in paragraph “a”, “c”, “d”, “e”, or “f” shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member as determined by the system in consultation with the system’s actuary. The member shall make an election by written request to the system and the election is subject to the approval of the system. If the member is married, election of an option under this section requires the written acknowledgment of the member’s spouse. However, the system may accept a married member’s election of a benefit option under this section without the written acknowledgment of the member’s spouse if the member submits a notarized statement indicating that the member has been unable to locate the member’s spouse to obtain the written acknowledgment of the spouse after reasonable diligent efforts. The member’s election of a benefit option shall become effective upon filing the necessary forms, including the notarized statement, with the system. The system shall not be liable to the member, the member’s spouse, or to any other person affected by the member’s election of a benefit option, based upon an election of benefit option accomplished without the written acknowledgment of the member’s spouse. The member may, if eligible, select one of the following options:\n\na. At retirement, a member may designate that upon the member’s death, a specified amount of money shall be paid to a named beneficiary, and the member’s monthly retirement allowance shall be reduced by an actuarially determined amount to provide for the lump sum payment. The amount designated by the member must be in thousand dollar increments and shall be limited to the amount of the member’s accumulated contributions. The amount designated shall not lower the monthly retirement allowance of the member by more than one-half the amount payable as provided in paragraph “b”. A member may designate a different beneficiary at any time, except as limited by an order that has been accepted by the system as complying with the requirements of section 97B.39. The election of a death benefit amount under this paragraph shall be irrevocable upon payment of the first monthly retirement allowance.\n\nb. A member may elect a retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member upon retirement under the retirement system pursuant to this chapter, to include the applicable provisions of sections 97B.49A through 97B.49G, and a death benefit as provided in section 97B.52, subsection 3.\n\nc. A member may elect an increased retirement allowance during the member’s lifetime with no death benefit after the member’s retirement date.\n\nd. (1) A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member’s lifetime and have the decreased retirement allowance, or a designated fraction thereof, continued after the member’s death to another person, called a contingent annuitant, during the lifetime of the contingent annuitant. The member cannot change the contingent annuitant after the member’s retirement. In case of the election of a contingent annuitant, no death benefits, as might otherwise be provided by this chapter, will be payable upon the death of either the member or the contingent annuitant after the member’s retirement.\n\n(2) In lieu of a benefit as calculated under subparagraph (1), a member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member’s lifetime and have the decreased retirement allowance, or a designated fraction thereof, continued after the member’s death to another person, called a contingent annuitant, during the lifetime of the contingent annuitant, as determined by this subparagraph. In addition, if the contingent annuitant dies prior to the death of the member, the member shall receive a retirement allowance beginning with the first month following the death of the contingent annuitant as if the member had selected the option provided by paragraph “b” at the time of the member’s first retirement. The member cannot change the contingent annuitant after the member’s retirement. If a contingent annuitant receives a decreased retirement allowance under this subparagraph following the death of the member, no death benefits, as might otherwise be provided by this chapter, will be payable upon the death of the contingent annuitant.\n\ne. A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member’s lifetime with provision that in event of the member’s death during the first one hundred twenty months of retirement, monthly payments of the member’s decreased retirement allowance shall be made to the member’s beneficiary until a combined total of one hundred twenty monthly payments have been made to the member and the member’s beneficiary. When the member designates multiple beneficiaries, the present value of the remaining payments shall be paid in a lump sum to each beneficiary, either in equal shares to the beneficiaries, or if the member specifies otherwise in a written request, in the specified proportion. A member may designate a different beneficiary at any time, except as limited by an order that has been accepted by the department as complying with the requirements of section 97B.39.\n\nf. A member retiring under section 97B.49B or 97B.49C may select an allowance upon retirement as provided under paragraph “a”, “b”, “c”, or “e”, or paragraph “d”, subparagraph (1), and may elect to have the monthly allowance otherwise payable to the member pursuant to the selected paragraph or subparagraph recalculated as provided in this paragraph. A member electing payment of a monthly allowance under this paragraph shall have the member’s monthly allowance increased, as determined by the system’s actuary, by an amount equal to the monthly federal social security benefit that would be payable to the member on the date the member would be first eligible to receive a reduced social security pension benefit based upon the member’s account. Upon reaching the date the member would be first eligible to receive a reduced social security pension benefit, the member’s monthly retirement allowance shall be permanently reduced, as determined by the system’s actuary. A member electing payment of an allowance under this paragraph shall provide the system with a copy of the estimate provided by the federal social security administration of the member’s monthly federal social security benefit that would be payable on the date the member would be first eligible to receive a reduced social security pension benefit at least sixty days prior to the member’s first month of entitlement.\n\n2.

      "text": "97B.52 Payment to beneficiary.\n\n1. If an inactive member who is vested by service, or any active member, dies prior to the member’s first month of entitlement, the member’s beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a death benefit equal to the greater of the amount provided in paragraph “a” or “b”. If an inactive member who is not vested by service dies prior to the member’s first month of entitlement, the member’s beneficiary shall only be entitled to receive a death benefit, as a lump sum, equal to the amount provided in paragraph “a”.\n\na. A lump sum payment equal to the accumulated contributions of the member at the date of death plus the product of an amount equal to the highest year of covered wages of the deceased member and the number of years of membership service divided by the applicable denominator. As used in this paragraph, “applicable denominator” means the following, based upon the type of membership service in which the member served either on the date of death, or if the member died after terminating service, on the date of the member’s last termination of service:\n\n(1) For regular service, the applicable denominator is thirty.\n\n(2) For service in a protection occupation, as defined in section 97B.49B, the applicable denominator is the applicable years of service for the member as defined in section 97B.49B if the member had retired on the date of death.\n\n(3) For service as a sheriff or deputy sheriff, as provided in section 97B.49C, the applicable denominator is twenty-two.\n\nb. For a member who dies on or after January 1, 2001, a lump sum payment equal to the actuarial present value of the member’s accrued benefit as of the date of death. The actuarial equivalent present value of the member’s accrued benefit as of the date of death shall be calculated using the same interest rate and mortality tables that are used by the system and the system’s actuary under section 97B.51, and shall assume that the member would have retired at the member’s earliest normal retirement date.\n\nc. The payment of a death benefit to a designated beneficiary as provided by this subsection shall be in a lump sum payment. However, if the designated beneficiary is a sole individual, the beneficiary may elect to receive, in lieu of a lump sum payment under this subsection, a monthly annuity payable for the life of the beneficiary. The monthly annuity shall be calculated by applying the annuity tables used by the system to the lump sum payment under this subsection based on the beneficiary’s age. If the designated beneficiary is more than one individual, or if the designated beneficiary is an estate, trust, church, charity, or other similar organization, a death benefit under this subsection shall only be paid in a lump sum.\n\n2. a. If the system determines, upon the receipt of evidence and proof, that the death of a member in special service was the direct and proximate result of a traumatic personal injury incurred in the line of duty as a member in special service, a line of duty death benefit in an amount of one hundred thousand dollars shall be paid in a lump sum to the special service member’s beneficiary. A line of duty death benefit payable under this subsection shall be in addition to any death benefit payable as provided in subsection 1.\n\nb. A line of duty death benefit shall not be payable under this subsection if any of the following applies:\n\n(1) The death resulted from stress, strain, occupational illness, or a chronic, progressive, or congenital illness, including, but not limited to, a disease of the heart, lungs, or respiratory system, unless a traumatic personal injury was a substantial contributing factor to the special service member’s death.\n\n(2) The death was caused by the intentional misconduct of the special service member or by the special service member’s intent to cause the special service member’s own death.\n\n(3) The special service member was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of death.\n\n(4) The special service member was performing the special service member’s duties in a grossly negligent manner at the time of death.\n\n(5) A beneficiary who would otherwise be entitled to a benefit under this subsection was, through the beneficiary’s actions, a substantial contributing factor to the special service member’s death.\n\n(6) The death qualifies for a volunteer emergency services provider death benefit pursuant to section 100B.31.\n\n3. If a member dies on or after the first day of the member’s first month of entitlement, the excess, if any, of the accumulated contributions by the member as of said date over the total gross monthly retirement allowances received by the member under the retirement system will be paid to the member’s beneficiary unless the retirement allowance is then being paid in accordance with section 97B.48 or with section 97B.51, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, “c”, “d”, or “e”.\n\n4. a. Other than as provided in subsections 1, 2, and 3 of this section, or section 97B.51, all rights to any benefits under the retirement system shall cease upon the death of a member.\n\nb. If a death benefit is due and payable on behalf of a member who dies prior to the member’s first month of entitlement, interest shall continue to accumulate through the quarter preceding the quarter in which payment is made to the designated beneficiary, heirs at law, or the estate unless the payment of the death benefit is delayed because of a dispute between alleged heirs, in which case the benefit due and payable shall be placed in a noninterest bearing escrow account until the beneficiary is determined in accordance with this section.\n\n5. a. In order to receive the death benefit, the beneficiary, heirs at law, or the estate, or any other third-party payee, must apply to the system within five years of the member’s death. However, death benefits payable under this section shall not exceed the amount permitted pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) and the applicable treasury regulations.\n\nb. The system shall reinstate a designated beneficiary’s right to receive a death benefit beyond the five-year limitation if the designated beneficiary was the member’s spouse at the time of the member’s death and the distribution is required or permitted pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) and the applicable treasury regulations.\n\n6. Following written notification to the system, a beneficiary of a deceased member may waive current and future rights to payments to which the beneficiary would otherwise be entitled under section 97B.51, subsection 1, paragraphs “a”, “b”, and “e”. Upon receipt of the waiver, the system shall pay the amount designated to be received by that beneficiary to the member’s other surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries or to the estate of the deceased member, as elected by the beneficiary in the waiver. If the payments being waived are payable to the member’s estate and an estate is not probated, the payments shall be paid to the deceased member’s surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the member’s heirs other than the beneficiary who waived the payments.\n\n7. If a member has not filed a designation of beneficiary with the system, the death benefit is payable to the member’s estate. If no designation has been filed and an estate is not probated, the death benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse, if any. If no designation has been filed, no estate has been probated, and there is no surviving spouse, the death benefit shall be paid to the heirs as provided in this subsection. The system shall pay the full amount of a member’s death benefits to those heirs who have presented a claim for such benefits within five years after the member’s date of death. The system is not liable for the payment of any claims by heirs who make themselves known to the system more than five years after the date of death of the member. If a death benefit is not paid as provided by this subsection, the death benefit shall remain in the fund.\n\n[C46, 50, §97.14 – 97.18, 97.39; C54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §97B.52]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1285, §14, 15; 90 Acts, ch 1240, §38; 92 Acts, ch 1201, §51 – 54; 95 Acts, ch 102, §9\n\n; 96 Acts, ch 1187, §45 – 47\n\n; 98 Acts, ch 1183, §50 – 54; 2000 Acts, ch 1077, §53 – 58; 2001 Acts, ch 68, §21, 24; 2002 Acts, ch 1135, §28, 37; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2004 Acts, ch 1103, §42 – 45; 2006 Acts, ch 1103, §2; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2008 Acts, ch 1171, §38, 48; 2010 Acts, ch 1167, §32\n\nReferred to in §97B.49A, 97B.49F, 97B.49G, 97B.50A, 97B.51, 97B.53, 256.212, 509A.13C",

Upon the termination of employment with the employer prior to retirement other than by death of a member, the member’s account, consisting of accumulated contributions by the member and, for a member who is vested on the date an application for a refund is filed, the member’s share of the accumulated employer contributions for the vested member at the date of the termination, may be paid to the member upon application, except as provided in subsections 2, 4, and 8. For the purpose of this subsection, the “member’s share of the accumulated employer contributions” is an amount equal to the accumulated employer contributions of the member multiplied by a fraction of years of service for that member as defined in section 97B.49A, 97B.49B, or 97B.49C.\n\n2. If a vested member’s employment is terminated prior to the member’s retirement, other than by death, the member may receive a monthly retirement allowance commencing on the first day of the month in which the member attains the age of sixty-five years, if the member is then alive, or, if the member so elects in accordance with section 97B.47, commencing on the first day of the month in which the member attains the age of fifty-five or any month thereafter prior to the date the member attains the age of sixty-five years, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter during the member’s lifetime, provided the member does not receive prior to the date the member’s retirement allowance is to commence a refund of moneys in the member’s account as provided under any of the provisions of this chapter. The amount of each such monthly retirement allowance shall be determined as provided in either sections 97B.49A through 97B.49G, or in section 97B.50, whichever is applicable.\n\n3. A terminated, vested member has the right, prior to the commencement of the member’s retirement allowance, to receive a refund of moneys in the member’s account, and in the event of the death of the member prior to the commencement of the member’s retirement allowance and prior to the receipt of any such refund, the benefits authorized by section 97B.52, subsections 1 and 2, shall be paid.\n\n4. A member has not terminated employment for purposes of this section if the member commences other covered employment within thirty days after the date employment was terminated with a covered employer, or if the member begins covered employment prior to filing a request for a refund with the system.\n\n5. Within sixty days after a member has been issued payment for a refund of moneys in the member’s account, the member may repay the moneys refunded, plus interest that would have accrued, as determined by the system, and receive credit for membership service for the period covered by the refund payment.\n\n6. A member who does not withdraw moneys in the member’s account upon termination of employment may at any time request the return of the moneys in the member’s account, but if the member receives a return of moneys in the member’s account the member has waived all claims for any other benefits and membership rights from the fund.\n\n7. If a member is involuntarily terminated from covered employment, has been issued payment for a refund, and is retroactively reinstated in covered employment as a remedy for an employment dispute, the member may receive credit for membership service for the period covered by the refund payment upon repayment to the system within ninety days after the date of the order or agreement requiring reinstatement of the amount of the refund plus interest that would have accrued, as determined by the system.\n\n8. The system is under no obligation to maintain the member account of a member who terminates covered employment prior to December 31, 1998, if the member was not vested at the time of termination.

The system is under no obligation to maintain the member accounts of such persons after January 1, 1964.\n\n9. Any member whose employment is terminated may elect to leave the moneys in the member’s member account in the retirement fund.\n\n10.
