The department shall investigate the financial responsibility, security, and integrity of any lottery system vendor who is a finalist in submitting a bid, proposal, or offer as part of a major procurement contract. Before a major procurement contract is awarded, the division of criminal investigation of the department of public safety shall conduct a background investigation of the vendor to whom the contract is to be awarded. The administrator shall consult with the division of criminal investigation and shall provide for the scope of the background investigation and due diligence to be conducted in connection with major procurement contracts. At the time of submitting a bid, proposal, or offer to the department on a major procurement contract, each vendor shall be required to submit to the division of criminal investigation appropriate investigation authorization to facilitate this investigation, together with an advance of funds to meet the anticipated investigation costs. If the division of criminal investigation determines that additional funds are required to complete an investigation, the vendor will be so advised. The background investigation by the division of criminal investigation may include a national criminal history check through the federal bureau of investigation. The screening of vendors or their employees through the federal bureau of investigation shall be conducted by submission of fingerprints through the state criminal history repository to the federal bureau of investigation.\n\n2.

Any contract with a vendor that does not comply with the requirements for periodically updating such disclosures during the tenure of the contract as may be specified in such contract may be terminated. The provisions of this section shall be construed broadly and liberally to achieve the ends of full disclosure of all information necessary to allow for a full and complete evaluation by the department of the competence, integrity, background, and character of vendors for major procurements.\n\n4. A major procurement contract shall not be entered into with any vendor who has been found guilty of a felony related to the security or integrity of the lottery in this or any other jurisdiction.\n\n5. If, based on the results of a background investigation, the department determines that the best interests of the department, including but not limited to the department’s reputation for integrity, would be served thereby, the department may disqualify a potential vendor from contracting with the department for a major procurement contract or from acting as a subcontractor in connection with a contract for a major procurement contract.\n\n2003 Acts, ch 178, §75, 121; 2003 Acts, ch 179, §61, 142; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §2324, 2325; 2023 Acts, ch 108, §56\n\nSubsections 1 and 3 amended\n\nSubsection 5 stricken and former subsection 6 amended and renumbered as 5",
