If the operation of gambling games at the pari-mutuel racetrack is not approved by a majority of the county electorate voting on the proposition at the election, the commission shall not issue a license to operate gambling games at the racetrack.\n\nd. If the proposition to operate gambling games is approved by a majority of the county electorate voting on the proposition, the board of supervisors shall submit a proposition requiring the approval or defeat of gambling games to the county electorate as provided in paragraph “e”, unless the operation of gambling games is terminated earlier as provided in this chapter or chapter 99D. However, if a proposition to operate gambling games is approved by a majority of the county electorate voting on the proposition in two successive elections, a subsequent submission and approval of a proposition under this subsection shall not thereafter be required to authorize the conduct of gambling games pursuant to this chapter.\n\ne. After a referendum has been held which approved or defeated a proposal to conduct gambling games as provided in this section, another referendum on a proposal to conduct gambling games shall not be held until the eighth calendar year thereafter.\n\n12.
