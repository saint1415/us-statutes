A law enforcement officer shall not be examined or be required to give evidence in any criminal proceeding that requires the disclosure of any records or information relating to any of the following:\n\n(1) Identification documents or other documents necessary to conduct a lawful undercover criminal investigation.\n\n(2) Personal identifying information about the law enforcement officer or immediate family member of the law enforcement officer, or other information unrelated to the law enforcement officer’s professional duties which could be used to threaten, harm, or intimidate the law enforcement officer or immediate family member of the law enforcement officer, or other information that could reasonably be construed to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy of the law enforcement officer or immediate family member of the law enforcement officer. Personal information that is knowingly and voluntarily disclosed by the law enforcement officer or immediate family member of the law enforcement officer may be redisseminated.\n\nb. A law enforcement officer who is called to testify shall not disclose information that is subject to nondisclosure as a result of a court order, statute, contract, or a condition or requirement of a grant.\n\n2. In determining whether nondisclosure of confidential or privileged information about a law enforcement officer may affect a defendant’s right to present a defense, the court shall make findings on the record regarding the impact of disclosure on the personal safety of the law enforcement officer or immediate family member of the law enforcement officer if the evidence is disclosed, the probative value of the confidential or privileged information about the law enforcement officer, the impact of disclosure on public safety, the potential for partial or limited disclosure of the privileged information, and the defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense. Any privileged information that is admitted for purposes of a pretrial hearing or a preliminary admissibility determination shall remain confidential.\n\n2017 Acts, ch 122, §4\n\nReferred to in §11.41, 22.7(5)",
