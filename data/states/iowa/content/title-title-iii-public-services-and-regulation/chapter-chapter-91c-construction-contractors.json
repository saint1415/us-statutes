Release of the bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all taxes, including contributions due under the unemployment compensation insurance system, penalties, interest, and related fees, which may accrue to the state of Iowa. If at any time during the term of the bond, the department of revenue or the department determines that the amount of the bond is not sufficient to cover the tax liabilities accruing to the state of Iowa, the director shall require the bond to be increased by an amount the director deems sufficient to cover the tax liabilities accrued and accruing.\n\n4. The department of revenue and the department shall adopt rules for the collection of the forfeiture. Notice shall be provided to the surety and to the contractor.

Upon the failure to timely request a hearing, the bond shall be forfeited. If, after the hearing upon timely request, the department of revenue or the department finds that the contractor has failed to pay the total of all taxes payable, the department of revenue or the department shall order the bond forfeited. The amount of the forfeiture shall be the amount of taxes payable or the amount of the bond, whichever is less. For purposes of this section “taxes payable” means all tax, penalties, interest, and fees that the department of revenue has previously determined to be due to the state by assessment or in an appeal of an assessment, including contributions to the unemployment compensation insurance system.\n\n5. If it is determined that this section may cause denial of federal funds which would otherwise be available, or is otherwise inconsistent with requirements of federal law, this section shall be suspended, but only to the extent necessary to prevent denial of the funds or to eliminate the inconsistency with federal requirements.\n\n6.
