These undesirable consequences can be reduced by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment. This chapter provides for payment of benefits to workers unemployed through no fault of their own. The policy in this chapter is intended to encourage stabilization in employment, to provide for integrated employment and training services in support of state economic development programs, and to provide meaningful job training and employment opportunities for the unemployed, underemployed, economically disadvantaged, dislocated workers, and others with substantial barriers to employment. To further this public policy, the state, through its department of workforce development, will maintain close coordination among all federal, state, and local agencies whose missions affect the employment or employability of the unemployed and underemployed.\n\n[C39, §1551.08; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.2]\n\n2022 Acts, ch 1136, §1; 2023 Acts, ch 66, §20\n\nSection amended",

      "text": "96.3 Payment — determination — duration — child support intercept.\n\n1. Payment. Twenty-four months after the date when contributions first accrue under this chapter, benefits shall become payable from the fund; provided, that wages earned for services defined in section 96.1A, subsection 16, paragraph “g”, subparagraph (3), irrespective of when performed, shall not be included for purposes of determining eligibility, under section 96.4 or full-time weekly wages, under subsection 4 of this section, for the purposes of any benefit year, nor shall any benefits with respect to unemployment be payable under subsection 5 of this section on the basis of such wages. All benefits shall be paid through employment offices in accordance with such regulations as the department of workforce development may prescribe.\n\n2. Total unemployment. Each eligible individual who is totally unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to such week benefits in an amount which shall be equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount.\n\n3. Partial unemployment. An individual who is partially unemployed in any week as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 37, paragraph “b”, and who meets the conditions of eligibility for benefits shall be paid with respect to that week an amount equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount less that part of wages payable to the individual with respect to that week in excess of one-fourth of the individual’s weekly benefit amount. The benefits shall be rounded to the lower multiple of one dollar.\n\n4. Determination of benefits.\n\na. With respect to benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 1983, an eligible individual’s weekly benefit amount for a week of total unemployment shall be an amount equal to the following fractions of the individual’s total wages in insured work paid during that quarter of the individual’s base period in which such total wages were highest. The director shall determine annually a maximum weekly benefit amount equal to the following percentages, to vary with the number of dependents, of the statewide average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work which shall be effective the first day of the first full week in July:\n\nIf the The weekly Subject to\n\nnumber of benefit amount the following\n\ndependents shall equal maximum\n\nis: the following percentage of\n\nfraction of high the statewide\n\nquarter wages: average\n\nweekly wage:\n\n4 or more 1/19 65%\n\nb. The maximum weekly benefit amount, if not a multiple of one dollar, shall be rounded to the lower multiple of one dollar. However, until such time as sixty-five percent of the statewide average weekly wage exceeds one hundred ninety dollars, the maximum weekly benefit amounts shall be determined using the statewide average weekly wage computed on the basis of wages reported for calendar year 1981. As used in this section, “dependent” means dependent as defined in section 422.12, subsection 1, paragraph “a”, as if the individual claimant was a taxpayer, except that an individual claimant’s nonworking spouse shall be deemed to be a dependent under this section. “Nonworking spouse” means a spouse who does not earn more than one hundred twenty dollars in gross wages in one week.\n\n5. a. Duration of benefits. The maximum total amount of benefits payable to an eligible individual during a benefit year shall not exceed the total of the wage credits accrued to the individual’s account during the individual’s base period, or sixteen times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, whichever is the lesser. The director shall maintain a separate account for each individual who earns wages in insured work. The director shall compute wage credits for each individual by crediting the individual’s account with one-third of the wages for insured work paid to the individual during the individual’s base period. However, the director shall recompute wage credits for an individual who is laid off due to the individual’s employer going out of business at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual was last employed, by crediting the individual’s account with one-half, instead of one-third, of the wages for insured work paid to the individual during the individual’s base period. Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged against the base period wage credits in the individual’s account which have not been previously charged, in the inverse chronological order as the wages on which the wage credits are based were paid. However if the state “off” indicator is in effect and if the individual is laid off due to the individual’s employer going out of business at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual was last employed, the maximum benefits payable shall be extended to twenty-six times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, but not to exceed the total of the wage credits accrued to the individual’s account.\n\nb. Training extension benefits.\n\n(1) An individual who has been separated from a declining occupation or who has been involuntarily separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the last place of employment and who is in training with the approval of the director or in a job training program pursuant to the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-220, at the time regular benefits are exhausted, may be eligible for training extension benefits.\n\n(2) A declining occupation is one in which there is a lack of sufficient current demand in the individual’s labor market area for the occupational skills for which the individual is fitted by training and experience or current physical or mental capacity, and the lack of employment opportunities is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or the individual’s occupation is one for which there is a seasonal variation in demand in the labor market and the individual has no other skill for which there is current demand.\n\n(3) The training extension benefit amount shall be twenty-six times the individual’s weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit amount shall be equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount for the claim in which benefits were exhausted while in training.\n\n(4) An individual who is receiving training extension benefits shall not be denied benefits due to application of section 96.4, subsection 3, or section 96.5, subsection 3. However, an employer’s account shall not be charged with benefits so paid. Relief of charges under this paragraph “b” applies to both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5.\n\n(5) In order for the individual to be eligible for training extension benefits, all of the following criteria must be met:\n\n(a) The training must be for a high-demand occupation or high-technology occupation, including the fields of life sciences, advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, alternative fuels, insurance, and environmental technology. “High-demand occupation” means an occupation in a labor market area in which the department determines work opportunities are available and there is a lack of qualified applicants.\n\n(b) The individual must file any unemployment insurance claim to which the individual becomes entitled under state or federal law, and must draw any unemployment insurance benefits on that claim until the claim has expired or has been exhausted, in order to maintain the individual’s eligibility under this paragraph “b”. Training extension benefits end upon completion of the training even though a portion of the training extension benefit amount may remain.\n\n(c) The individual must be enrolled and making satisfactory progress to complete the training.\n\n6. Part-time workers.\n\na. As used in this subsection the term “part-time worker” means an individual whose normal work is in an occupation in which the individual’s services are not required for the customary scheduled full-time hours prevailing in the establishment in which the individual is employed, or who, owing to personal circumstances, does not customarily work the customary scheduled full-time hours prevailing in the establishment in which the individual is employed.\n\nb. The director shall prescribe fair and reasonable general rules applicable to part-time workers, for determining their full-time weekly wage, and the total wages in employment by employers required to qualify such workers for benefits. An individual is a part-time worker if a majority of the weeks of work in such individual’s base period includes part-time work. Part-time workers are not required to be available for, seek, or accept full-time employment.\n\n7. Recovery of overpayment of benefits.\n\na. If an individual receives benefits for which the individual is subsequently determined to be ineligible, even though the individual acts in good faith and is not otherwise at fault, the benefits shall be recovered. The department in its discretion may recover the overpayment of benefits either by having a sum equal to the overpayment deducted from any future benefits payable to the individual or by having the individual pay to the department a sum equal to the overpayment.\n\nb. (1) (a) If the department determines that an overpayment has been made, the charge for the overpayment against the employer’s account shall be removed and the account shall be credited with an amount equal to the overpayment from the unemployment compensation trust fund and this credit shall include both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5. The employer shall not be relieved of charges if benefits are paid because the employer or an agent of the employer failed to respond timely or adequately to the department’s request for information relating to the payment of benefits. This prohibition against relief of charges shall apply to both contributory and reimbursable employers. If the department determines that an employer’s failure to respond timely or adequately was due to insufficient notification from the department, the employer’s account shall not be charged for the overpayment.\n\n(b) However, provided the benefits were not received as the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the individual, benefits shall not be recovered from an individual if the employer did not participate in the initial determination to award benefits pursuant to section 96.6, subsection 2, and an overpayment occurred because of a subsequent reversal on appeal regarding the issue of the individual’s separation from employment.\n\n(2) An accounting firm, agent, unemployment insurance accounting firm, or other entity that represents an employer in unemployment claim matters and demonstrates a continuous pattern of failing to participate in the initial determinations to award benefits, as determined and defined by rule by the department, shall be denied permission by the department to represent any employers in unemployment insurance matters. This subparagraph does not apply to attorneys or counselors admitted to practice in the courts of this state pursuant to section 602.10101.\n\n8. Back pay. If an individual receives benefits for a period of unemployment and subsequently receives a payment for the same period from the individual’s employer in the form of or in lieu of back pay, the benefits shall be recovered. The department, in its discretion, may reach an agreement with the individual and the employer to allow the employer to deduct the amount of the benefits from the back pay and remit a sum equal to that amount to the unemployment compensation fund and the balance to the individual, or may recover the amount of the benefits either by having a sum equal to that amount deducted from any future benefits payable to the individual or by having the individual pay to the department a sum equal to that amount. If an agreement is reached to allow the employer to deduct the amount of benefits from the back pay and remit that amount to the fund, the department shall not charge that amount to the employer’s account under section 96.7.\n\n9. Child support intercept.\n\na. An individual filing a claim for benefits under section 96.6, subsection 1, shall, at the time of filing, disclose whether the individual owes a child support obligation which is being enforced by child support services established in section 252B.2. If an individual discloses that such a child support obligation is owed and the individual is determined to be eligible for benefits under this chapter, the department shall notify child support services of the individual’s disclosure and deduct and withhold from benefits payable to the individual the amount specified by the individual.\n\nb. However, if child support services and an individual owing a child support obligation reach an agreement to have specified amounts deducted and withheld from the individual’s benefits and child support services submits a copy of the agreement to the department, the department shall deduct and withhold the specified amounts.\n\nc. (1) However, if the department is notified of income withholding by child support services under chapter 252D or section 598.22 or 598.23 or if income is garnisheed by child support services under chapter 642 and an individual’s benefits are condemned to the satisfaction of the child support obligation being enforced by child support services, the department shall deduct and withhold from the individual’s benefits that amount required through legal process.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding section 642.2, subsections 2, 3, 6, and 7, which restrict garnishments under chapter 642 to wages of public employees, the department may be garnisheed under chapter 642 by child support services established in section 252B.2, pursuant to a judgment for child support against an individual eligible for benefits under this chapter.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding section 96.15, benefits under this chapter are not exempt from income withholding, garnishment, attachment, or execution if withheld for or garnisheed by child support services, established in section 252B.2, or if an income withholding order or notice of the income withholding order under section 598.22 or 598.23 is being enforced by child support services to satisfy the child support obligation of an individual who is eligible for benefits under this chapter.\n\nd. An amount deducted and withheld under paragraph “a”, “b”, or “c” shall be paid by the department to child support services, and shall be treated as if it were paid to the individual as benefits under this chapter and as if it were paid by the individual to child support services in satisfaction of the individual’s child support obligations.\n\ne. If an agreement for reimbursement has been made, the department shall be reimbursed by child support services for the administrative costs incurred by the department under this section which are attributable to the enforcement of child support obligations by child support services.\n\n10. Voluntary income tax withholding. All payments of benefits made after December 31, 1996, are subject to the following:\n\na. An individual filing a new application for benefits shall, at the time of filing the application, be advised of the following:\n\n(1) Benefits paid under this chapter are subject to federal and state income tax.\n\n(2) Legal requirements exist pertaining to estimated tax payments.\n\n(3) The individual may elect to have federal income tax deducted and withheld from the individual’s payment of benefits at the amount specified in the Internal Revenue Code as defined in section 422.3.\n\n(4) The individual may elect to have Iowa state income tax deducted and withheld from the individual’s payment of benefits at the rate of five percent.\n\n(5) The individual shall be permitted to change the individual’s previously elected withholding status.\n\nb. Amounts deducted and withheld from benefits shall remain in the unemployment compensation fund until transferred to the appropriate taxing authority as a payment of income tax.\n\nc. The director shall follow all procedures specified by the United States department of labor, the federal internal revenue service, and the department of revenue pertaining to the deducting and withholding of income tax.\n\nd. Amounts shall be deducted and withheld under this subsection only after amounts are deducted and withheld for any overpayment of benefits, child support obligations, and any other amounts authorized to be deducted and withheld under federal or state law.\n\n11. Overissuance of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits. The department shall collect any overissuance of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits by offsetting the amount of the overissuance from the benefits payable under this chapter to the individual.

      "text": "96.4 Required findings.\n\nAn unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the department finds that:\n\n1. The individual has registered for work at and thereafter has continued to report at an employment office in accordance with such regulations as the department may prescribe. The provisions of this subsection shall be waived if the individual is deemed temporarily unemployed as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 37, paragraph “c”.\n\n2. The individual has made a claim for benefits in accordance with the provisions of section 96.6, subsection 1.\n\n3. a. The individual is able to work, is available for work, and is earnestly and actively seeking work. This subsection is waived if the individual is deemed partially unemployed, while employed at the individual’s regular job, as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 37, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (1), or temporarily unemployed as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 37, paragraph “c”. The work search requirements of this subsection and the disqualification requirement for failure to apply for, or to accept suitable work of section 96.5, subsection 3, are waived if the individual is not disqualified for benefits under section 96.5, subsection 1, paragraph “h”.\n\nb. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the department may establish by rule a process to waive or alter the work search requirements of this subsection for a claim for benefits if an individual has a reasonable expectation that the individual will be returning to employment and is attached to a regular job or industry or a member in good standing of a union therein eligible for referral for employment. To be considered attached to a regular job or industry, an individual must be on a short-term temporary layoff. If work is not available at the conclusion of the layoff period due to short-term circumstances beyond the employer’s control, the employer may request an extension of the waiver or alteration for up to two weeks from the department. For purposes of this paragraph, “short-term temporary layoff” means a layoff period of sixteen weeks or less due to seasonal weather conditions that impact the ability to perform work related to highway construction, repair, or maintenance with a specific return-to-work date verified by the employer.\n\n4. a. The individual has been paid wages for insured work during the individual’s base period in an amount at least one and one-quarter times the wages paid to the individual during that quarter of the individual’s base period in which the individual’s wages were highest; provided that the individual has been paid wages for insured work totaling at least three and five-tenths percent of the statewide average annual wage for insured work, computed for the preceding calendar year if the individual’s benefit year begins on or after the first full week in July and computed for the second preceding calendar year if the individual’s benefit year begins before the first full week in July, in that calendar quarter in the individual’s base period in which the individual’s wages were highest, and the individual has been paid wages for insured work totaling at least one-half of the amount of wages required under this paragraph in the calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual’s wages were highest, in a calendar quarter in the individual’s base period other than the calendar quarter in which the individual’s wages were highest. The calendar quarter wage requirements shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of ten dollars.\n\nb. For an individual who does not have sufficient wages in the base period, as defined in section 96.1A, to otherwise qualify for benefits pursuant to this subsection, the individual’s base period shall be the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual’s benefit year if such period qualifies the individual for benefits under this subsection.\n\n(1) Wages that fall within the alternative base period established under this paragraph “b” are not available for qualifying benefits in any subsequent benefit year.\n\n(2) Employers shall be charged in the manner provided in this chapter for benefits paid based upon quarters used in the alternative base period.\n\nc. If the individual has drawn benefits in any benefit year, the individual must during or subsequent to that year, work in and be paid wages for insured work totaling at least eight times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, as a condition to receive benefits in the next benefit year.\n\n5. Benefits based on service in employment in a nonprofit organization or government entity, defined in section 96.1A, subsection 16, are payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the same basis of other service subject to this chapter, except that:\n\na. Benefits based on service in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity in an educational institution including service in or provided to or on behalf of an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency, a government entity, or a nonprofit organization shall not be paid to an individual for any week of unemployment which begins during the period between two successive academic years or during a similar period between two regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual’s contract, if the individual has a contract or reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution for both such academic years or both such terms.\n\nb. Benefits based on service in any other capacity for an educational institution including service in or provided to or on behalf of an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency, a government entity, or a nonprofit organization, shall not be paid to an individual for any week of unemployment which begins during the period between two successive academic years or terms, if the individual performs the services in the first of such academic years or terms and has reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services for the second of such academic years or terms. If benefits are denied to an individual for any week as a result of this paragraph and the individual is not offered an opportunity to perform the services for an educational institution for the second of such academic years or terms, the individual is entitled to retroactive payments of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this paragraph.\n\nc. With respect to services for an educational institution in any capacity under paragraph “a” or “b”, benefits shall not be paid to an individual for any week of unemployment which begins during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs the services in the period immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess, and the individual has reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services in the period immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess.\n\nd. For purposes of this subsection, “educational service agency” means a governmental agency or government entity which is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing educational services to one or more educational institutions.\n\n6. a. An otherwise eligible individual shall not be denied benefits for any week because the individual is in training with the approval of the director, nor shall the individual be denied benefits with respect to any week in which the individual is in training with the approval of the director by reason of the application of the provision in subsection 3 of this section relating to availability for work, and an active search for work or the provision of section 96.5, subsection 3, relating to failure to apply for or a refusal to accept suitable work. However, an employer’s account shall not be charged with benefits so paid.\n\nb. (1) An otherwise eligible individual shall not be denied benefits for a week because the individual is in training approved under 19 U.S.C. §2296(a), as amended by section 2506 of the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, because the individual leaves work which is not suitable employment to enter the approved training, or because of the application of subsection 3 of this section or section 96.5, subsection 3, or a federal unemployment insurance law administered by the department relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work.\n\n(2) For purposes of this paragraph, “suitable employment” means work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than an individual’s past adversely affected employment, as defined in 19 U.S.C. §2319(l), if weekly wages for the work are not less than eighty percent of the individual’s average weekly wage.\n\n7. The individual participates in reemployment services as directed by the department pursuant to a profiling system, established by the department, which identifies individuals who are likely to exhaust benefits and be in need of reemployment services.\n\n[C39, §1551.10; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.4; 82 Acts, ch 1030, §2]\n\n83 Acts, ch 190, §5 – 8, 26, 27; 84 Acts, ch 1255, §1, 2; 87 Acts, ch 222, §3; 91 Acts, ch 45, §1, 2; 94 Acts, ch 1066, §6; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §176, 197; 2009 Acts, ch 22, §3, 9; 2017 Acts, ch 72, §1, 2; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §84 – 86; 2021 Acts, ch 171, §26 – 28\n\nReferred to in §96.3, 96.6, 96.20, 96.23\n\n2021 amendment to subsection 3 applies to any new claim of unemployment benefits beginning on or after June 13, 2021; 2021 Acts, ch 171, §27, 28",

      "text": "96.5 Causes for disqualification.\n\nAn individual shall be disqualified for benefits, regardless of the source of the individual’s wage credits:\n\n1. Voluntary quitting. If the individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the individual’s employer, if so found by the department. But the individual shall not be disqualified if the department finds that:\n\na. The individual left employment in good faith for the sole purpose of accepting other or better employment, which the individual did accept, and the individual performed services in the new employment. Benefits relating to wage credits earned with the employer that the individual has left shall be charged to the unemployment compensation fund. This paragraph applies to both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5.\n\nb. The individual’s leaving was caused by the relocation of the individual’s spouse by the military. The employer’s account shall not be charged for any benefits paid to an individual who leaves due to the relocation of a military spouse. Relief of charges under this paragraph applies to both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5.\n\nc. The individual left employment for the necessary and sole purpose of taking care of a member of the individual’s immediate family who was then injured or ill, and if after said member of the family sufficiently recovered, the individual immediately returned to and offered the individual’s services to the individual’s employer, provided, however, that during such period the individual did not accept any other employment.\n\nd. The individual left employment because of illness, injury, or pregnancy upon the advice of a licensed and practicing physician or physician assistant, and upon knowledge of the necessity for absence immediately notified the employer, or the employer consented to the absence, and after recovering from the illness, injury, or pregnancy, when recovery was certified by a licensed and practicing physician or physician assistant, the individual returned to the employer and offered to perform services and the individual’s regular work or comparable suitable work was not available, if so found by the department, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\ne. The individual left employment upon the advice of a licensed and practicing physician or physician assistant, for the sole purpose of taking a member of the individual’s family to a place having a different climate, during which time the individual shall be deemed unavailable for work, and notwithstanding during such absence the individual secures temporary employment, and returned to the individual’s regular employer and offered the individual’s services and the individual’s regular work or comparable work was not available, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\nf. The individual left the employing unit for not to exceed ten working days, or such additional time as may be allowed by the individual’s employer, for compelling personal reasons, if so found by the department, and prior to such leaving had informed the individual’s employer of such compelling personal reasons, and immediately after such compelling personal reasons ceased to exist the individual returned to the individual’s employer and offered the individual’s services and the individual’s regular or comparable work was not available, provided the individual is otherwise eligible; except that during the time the individual is away from the individual’s work because of the continuance of such compelling personal reasons, the individual shall not be eligible for benefits.\n\ng. The individual left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer under circumstances which did or would disqualify the individual for benefits, except as provided in paragraph “a” of this subsection but, subsequent to the leaving, the individual worked in and was paid wages for insured work equal to ten times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\nh. The individual has left employment in lieu of exercising a right to bump or oust a fellow employee with less seniority or priority from the fellow employee’s job.\n\ni. The individual is unemployed as a result of the individual’s employer selling or otherwise transferring a clearly segregable and identifiable part of the employer’s business or enterprise to another employer which does not make an offer of suitable work to the individual as provided under subsection 3. However, if the individual does accept, and works in and is paid wages for, suitable work with the acquiring employer, the benefits paid which are based on the wages paid by the transferring employer shall be charged to the unemployment compensation fund provided that the acquiring employer has not received, or will not receive, a partial transfer of experience under the provisions of section 96.7, subsection 2, paragraph “b”. Relief of charges under this paragraph applies to both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5.\n\nj. (1) The individual is a temporary employee of a temporary employment firm who notifies the temporary employment firm of completion of an employment assignment and who seeks reassignment. Failure of the individual to notify the temporary employment firm of completion of an employment assignment within three working days of the completion of each employment assignment under a contract of hire shall be deemed a voluntary quit unless the individual was not advised in writing of the duty to notify the temporary employment firm upon completion of an employment assignment or the individual had good cause for not contacting the temporary employment firm within three working days and notified the firm at the first reasonable opportunity thereafter.\n\n(2) To show that the employee was advised in writing of the notification requirement of this paragraph, the temporary employment firm shall advise the temporary employee by requiring the temporary employee, at the time of employment with the temporary employment firm, to read and sign a document that provides a clear and concise explanation of the notification requirement and the consequences of a failure to notify. The document shall be separate from any contract of employment and a copy of the signed document shall be provided to the temporary employee.\n\n(3) For purposes of this lettered paragraph:\n\n(a) “Temporary employee” means an individual who is employed by a temporary employment firm to provide services to clients to supplement their workforce during absences, seasonal workloads, temporary skill or labor market shortages, and for special assignments and projects.\n\n(b) “Temporary employment firm” means a person engaged in the business of employing temporary employees.\n\n2. Discharge for misconduct. If the department finds that the individual has been discharged for misconduct in connection with the individual’s employment:\n\na. The disqualification shall continue until the individual has worked in and has been paid wages for insured work equal to ten times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\nb. Provided further, if gross misconduct is established, the department shall cancel the individual’s wage credits earned, prior to the date of discharge, from all employers.\n\nc. Gross misconduct is deemed to have occurred after a claimant loses employment as a result of an act constituting an indictable offense in connection with the claimant’s employment, provided the claimant is duly convicted thereof or has signed a statement admitting the commission of such an act. Determinations regarding a benefit claim may be redetermined within five years from the effective date of the claim. Any benefits paid to a claimant prior to a determination that the claimant has lost employment as a result of such act shall not be considered to have been accepted by the claimant in good faith.\n\nd. For the purposes of this subsection, “misconduct” means a deliberate act or omission by an employee that constitutes a material breach of the duties and obligations arising out of the employee’s contract of employment. Misconduct is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer’s interest as is found in deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of employees, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree of recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer’s interests or of the employee’s duties and obligations to the employer. Misconduct by an individual includes but is not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) Material falsification of the individual’s employment application.\n\n(2) Knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule of an employer.\n\n(3) Intentional damage of an employer’s property.\n\n(4) Consumption of alcohol, illegal or nonprescribed prescription drugs, or an impairing substance in a manner not directed by the manufacturer, or a combination of such substances, on the employer’s premises in violation of the employer’s employment policies.\n\n(5) Reporting to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal or nonprescribed prescription drugs, or an impairing substance in an off-label manner, or a combination of such substances, on the employer’s premises in violation of the employer’s employment policies, unless the individual is compelled to work by the employer outside of scheduled or on-call working hours.\n\n(6) Conduct that substantially and unjustifiably endangers the personal safety of coworkers or the general public.\n\n(7) Incarceration for an act for which one could reasonably expect to be incarcerated that results in missing work.\n\n(8) Incarceration as a result of a misdemeanor or felony conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(9) Excessive unexcused tardiness or absenteeism.\n\n(10) Falsification of any work-related report, task, or job that could expose the employer or coworkers to legal liability or sanction for violation of health or safety laws.\n\n(11) Failure to maintain any license, registration, or certification that is reasonably required by the employer or by law, or that is a functional requirement to perform the individual’s regular job duties, unless the failure is not within the control of the individual.\n\n(12) Conduct that is libelous or slanderous toward an employer or an employee of the employer if such conduct is not protected under state or federal law.\n\n(13) Theft of an employer or coworker’s funds or property.\n\n(14) Intentional misrepresentation of time worked or work carried out that results in the individual receiving unearned wages or unearned benefits.\n\n3. Failure to accept work. If the department finds that an individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available, suitable work when directed by the department or to accept suitable work when offered that individual. The department shall, if possible, furnish the individual with the names of employers which are seeking employees. The individual shall apply to and obtain the signatures of the employers designated by the department on forms provided by the department. However, the employers may refuse to sign the forms. The individual’s failure to obtain the signatures of designated employers, which have not refused to sign the forms, shall disqualify the individual for benefits until requalified. To requalify for benefits after disqualification under this subsection, the individual shall work in and be paid wages for insured work equal to ten times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\na. (1) In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the department shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual’s health, safety, and morals, the individual’s physical fitness, prior training, length of unemployment, and prospects for securing local work in the individual’s customary occupation, the distance of the available work from the individual’s residence, and any other factor which the department finds bears a reasonable relation to the purposes of this paragraph. Work is suitable if the work meets all the other criteria of this paragraph and if the gross weekly wages for the work equal or exceed the following percentages of the individual’s average weekly wage for insured work paid to the individual during that quarter of the individual’s base period in which the individual’s wages were highest:\n\n(a) One hundred percent, if the work is offered during the first week of unemployment.\n\n(b) Ninety percent, if the work is offered during the second through the third week of unemployment.\n\n(c) Eighty percent, if the work is offered during the fourth through the fifth week of unemployment.\n\n(d) Seventy percent, if the work is offered during the sixth through the eighth week of unemployment.\n\n(e) Sixty percent, if the work is offered after the eighth week of unemployment.\n\n(2) However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not require an individual to accept employment below the federal minimum wage.\n\nb. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:\n\n(1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;\n\n(2) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality;\n\n(3) If as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.\n\n4. Labor disputes.\n\na. For any week with respect to which the department finds that the individual’s total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual is or was last employed, provided that this subsection shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that:\n\n(1) The individual is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work; and\n\n(2) The individual does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute.\n\nb. Provided, that if in any case separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises.\n\n5. Other compensation.\n\na. For any week with respect to which the individual is receiving or has received payment in the form of any of the following:\n\n(1) Wages in lieu of notice, separation allowance, severance pay, or dismissal pay.\n\n(2) Compensation for temporary disability under the workers’ compensation law of any state or under a similar law of the United States.\n\n(3) A governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or any other similar periodic payment made under a plan maintained or contributed to by a base period or chargeable employer where, except for benefits under the federal Social Security Act or the federal Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or the corresponding provisions of prior law, the plan’s eligibility requirements or benefit payments are affected by the base period employment or the remuneration for the base period employment. However, this subparagraph shall only be applicable if the base period employer has made one hundred percent of the contributions to the plan.\n\nb. Provided, that if the remuneration is less than the benefits which would otherwise be due under this chapter, the individual is entitled to receive for the week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced by the amount of the remuneration. Provided further, if benefits were paid for any week under this chapter for a period when benefits, remuneration, or compensation under paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), (2), or (3), were paid on a retroactive basis for the same period, or any part thereof, the department shall recover the excess amount of benefits paid by the department for the period, and no employer’s account shall be charged with benefits so paid. However, compensation for service-connected disabilities or compensation for accrued leave based on military service by the beneficiary with the armed forces of the United States, irrespective of the amount of the benefit, does not disqualify any individual otherwise qualified from any of the benefits contemplated herein. A deduction shall not be made from the amount of benefits payable for a week for individuals receiving federal social security pensions to take into account the individuals’ contributions to the pension program.\n\n6. Benefits from other state. For any week with respect to which or a part of which an individual has received or is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States, provided that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled to such unemployment benefits, this disqualification shall not apply.\n\n7. Vacation pay.\n\na. When an employer makes a payment or becomes obligated to make a payment to an individual for vacation pay, or for vacation pay allowance, or as pay in lieu of vacation, such payment or amount shall be deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, and shall be applied as provided in paragraph “c” of this subsection 7.\n\nb. When, in connection with a separation or layoff of an individual, the individual’s employer makes a payment or payments to the individual, or becomes obligated to make a payment to the individual as, or in the nature of, vacation pay, or vacation pay allowance, or as pay in lieu of vacation. The amount of a payment or obligation to make payment, is deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, and shall be applied as provided in paragraph “c” of this subsection 7.\n\nc. Of the wages described in paragraph “a” or paragraph “b”, a sum equal to the wages of such individual for a normal workday shall be attributed to, or deemed to be payable to the individual with respect to, the first and each subsequent workday in such period until such amount so paid or owing is exhausted, not to exceed five workdays. Any individual receiving or entitled to receive wages as provided herein shall be ineligible for benefits for any week in which the sums equal or exceed the individual’s weekly benefit amount. If the amount is less than the weekly benefit amount of such individual, the individual’s benefits shall be reduced by such amount.\n\nd. Notwithstanding contrary provisions in paragraphs “a”, “b”, and “c”, if an individual is separated from employment and is scheduled to receive vacation payments during the period of unemployment attributable to the employer, then payments made by the employer to the individual or an obligation to make a payment by the employer to the individual for vacation pay, vacation pay allowance or pay in lieu of vacation shall not be deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, for any period in excess of five workdays and such payments or the value of such obligations shall not be deducted for any period in excess of one week from the unemployment benefits the individual is otherwise entitled to receive under this chapter.\n\ne. If an employer pays or is obligated to pay a bonus to an individual at the same time the employer pays or is obligated to pay vacation pay, a vacation pay allowance, or pay in lieu of vacation, the bonus shall not be deemed wages for purposes of determining benefit eligibility and amount, and the bonus shall not be deducted from unemployment benefits the individual is otherwise entitled to receive under this chapter.\n\n8. Administrative penalty. If the department finds that, with respect to any week of an insured worker’s unemployment for which such person claims credit or benefits, such person has, within the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding such week, with intent to defraud by obtaining any benefits not due under this chapter, willfully and knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation, or willfully and knowingly failed to disclose a material fact; such person shall be disqualified for the week in which the department makes such determination, and forfeit all benefit rights under the unemployment compensation law for a period of not more than the remaining benefit period as determined by the department according to the circumstances of each case. Any penalties imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this chapter.\n\n9. Athletes — disqualified. Services performed by an individual, substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate, for any week which commences during the period between two successive sport seasons or similar periods, if such individual performs such services in the first of such seasons or similar periods and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the later of such season or similar periods.\n\n10. Aliens — disqualified. For services performed by an alien unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for the purpose of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed, including an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits. In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, no determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of the individual’s alien status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n11. Incarceration — disqualified.\n\na. If the department finds that the individual became separated from employment due to the individual’s incarceration in a jail, municipal holding facility, or correctional institution or facility, unless the department finds all of the following:\n\n(1) The individual notified the employer that the individual would be absent from work due to the individual’s incarceration prior to any such absence.\n\n(2) Criminal charges relating to the incarceration were not filed against the individual, all criminal charges against the individual relating to the incarceration were dismissed, or the individual was found not guilty of all criminal charges relating to the incarceration.\n\n(3) The individual reported back to the employer within two work days of the individual’s release from incarceration and offered services.\n\n(4) The employer rejected the individual’s offer of services.\n\nb. A disqualification under this subsection shall continue until the individual has worked in and has been paid wages for insured work equal to ten times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\n12. Supplemental part-time employment. If the department finds that an individual is disqualified for benefits under subsection 1 or 2 based on the nature of the individual’s separation from supplemental part-time employment, all wages paid by the supplemental part-time employer to that individual in any quarter which are chargeable following a disqualifying separation under subsection 1 or 2 shall not be considered wages credited to the individual until such time as the individual meets the conditions of requalification as provided for in this chapter, or until the period of disqualification provided for in this chapter has elapsed.\n\n13.

A representative designated by the director shall promptly notify all interested parties to the claim of its filing, and the parties have ten days from the date of issuance of the notice of the filing of the claim to protest payment of benefits to the claimant. All interested parties shall select a format as specified by the department to receive such notifications. The representative shall promptly examine the claim and any protest, take the initiative to ascertain relevant information concerning the claim, and, on the basis of the facts found by the representative, shall determine whether or not the claim is valid, the week with respect to which benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable and its maximum duration, and whether any disqualification shall be imposed. The claimant has the burden of proving that the claimant meets the basic eligibility conditions of section 96.4. The employer has the burden of proving that the claimant is disqualified for benefits pursuant to section 96.5, except as provided by this subsection. The claimant has the initial burden to produce evidence showing that the claimant is not disqualified for benefits in cases involving section 96.5, subsections 10 and 11, and has the burden of proving that a voluntary quit pursuant to section 96.5, subsection 1, was for good cause attributable to the employer and that the claimant is not disqualified for benefits in cases involving section 96.5, subsection 1, paragraphs “a” through “h”. Unless the claimant or other interested party, after notification or within ten calendar days after notification was issued, files an appeal from the decision, the decision is final and benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance with the decision. If an administrative law judge affirms a decision of the representative, or the appeal board affirms a decision of the administrative law judge allowing benefits, the benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal which is thereafter taken, but if the decision is finally reversed, no employer’s account shall be charged with benefits so paid and this relief from charges shall apply to both contributory and reimbursable employers, notwithstanding section 96.8, subsection 5.\n\n3. Appeals.\n\na. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, an administrative law judge, after affording the parties reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, shall affirm or modify the findings of fact and decision of the representative. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of chapter 17A relating to hearings for contested cases. Before the hearing is scheduled, the parties shall be afforded the opportunity to choose either a telephone hearing or an in-person hearing. A request for an in-person hearing shall be approved unless the in-person hearing would be impractical because of the distance between the parties to the hearing. The notice for a telephone or in-person hearing shall be sent to all the parties at least ten calendar days before the hearing date. Reasonable requests for the postponement of a hearing shall be granted. The parties shall be duly notified of the administrative law judge’s decision, together with the administrative law judge’s reasons for the decision, which is the final decision of the department, unless within fifteen days after the date of notification or mailing of the decision, further appeal is initiated pursuant to this section.\n\nb. Appeals from the initial determination shall be heard by an administrative law judge employed by the division of administrative hearings created by section 10A.801. An administrative law judge’s decision may be appealed by any party to the employment appeal board created in section 10A.601 or directly to the district court.\n\n4. Effect of determination. A finding of fact or law, judgment, conclusion, or final order made pursuant to this section by an employee or representative of the department, administrative law judge, or the employment appeal board, is binding only upon the parties to proceedings brought under this chapter, and is not binding upon any other proceedings or action involving the same facts brought by the same or related parties before the division of labor services, division of workers’ compensation, other state agency, arbitrator, court, or judge of this state or the United States.\n\n[C39, §1551.12; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.6]\n\n83 Acts, ch 190, §11, 12, 27; 84 Acts, ch 1255, §3; 86 Acts, ch 1245, §522, 523; 88 Acts, ch 1109, §9; 91 Acts, ch 43, §1; 95 Acts, ch 109, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 98 Acts, ch 1061, §9; 98 Acts, ch 1158, §1; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §177; 2017 Acts, ch 70, §4, 5; 2018 Acts, ch 1080, §4; 2020 Acts, ch 1088, §1; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §23; 2022 Acts, ch 1136, §7; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1714\n\nReferred to in §96.1A, 96.3, 96.4, 96.7(2)(a), 96.11, 235B.6\n\nSubsection 3, paragraph b amended",

There is hereby established as a special fund, separate and apart from all public moneys or funds of this state, an unemployment compensation fund, which shall be administered by the department exclusively for the purposes of this chapter. This fund shall consist of:\n\na. All contributions collected under this chapter,\n\nb. Interest earned upon any moneys in the fund,\n\nc. Any property or securities acquired through the use of moneys belonging to the fund,\n\nd. All earnings of such property or securities, and\n\ne. All money credited to this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund pursuant to section 903 of the Social Security Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. §501 – 503, 1103 – 1105, 1321 – 1324. All moneys in the unemployment compensation fund shall be mingled and undivided.\n\n2. Accounts and deposits.\n\na. The state treasurer shall be ex officio treasurer and custodian of the fund and shall administer such fund in accordance with the directions of the department. The director of the department of administrative services shall issue warrants upon the fund pursuant to the order of the department and such warrants shall be paid from the fund by the treasurer.\n\nb. The treasurer shall maintain within the fund three separate accounts:\n\n(1) A clearing account.\n\n(2) An unemployment trust fund account.\n\n(3) A benefit account.\n\nc. All moneys payable to the unemployment compensation fund and all interest and penalties on delinquent contributions and reports shall, upon receipt thereof by the department, be forwarded to the treasurer who shall immediately deposit them in the clearing account, but the interest and penalties on delinquent contributions and reports shall not be deemed to be a part of the fund. Refunds of contributions payable pursuant to section 96.14 shall be paid by the treasurer from the clearing account upon warrants issued by the director of the department of administrative services under the direction of the department. After clearance thereof, all other moneys in the clearing account, except interest and penalties on delinquent contributions and reports, shall be immediately deposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund, established and maintained pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act as amended, any provisions of law in this state relating to the deposit, administration, release, or disbursement of moneys in the possession or custody of this state to the contrary notwithstanding. Interest and penalties on delinquent contributions and reports collected from employers shall be transferred from the clearing account to the special employment security contingency fund. The benefit account shall consist of all moneys requisitioned from this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund for the payment of benefits. Except as herein otherwise provided, moneys in the clearing and benefit account may be deposited by the treasurer, under the direction of the department, in any bank or public depository in which general funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of the fund. The treasurer shall give a separate bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of the treasurer’s duties as custodian of the fund in an amount fixed by the governor and in form and manner prescribed by law. Premiums for said bond shall be paid from the administration fund.\n\nd. Interest paid upon the moneys deposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States shall be credited to the unemployment compensation fund.\n\n3. Withdrawals. Moneys shall be requisitioned from this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund solely for the payment of benefits and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the department, except that money credited to this state’s account pursuant to section 903 of the Social Security Act may, subject to the conditions prescribed in subsection 4 of this section, be used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter. The department shall from time to time requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to the account of this state therein, as the department deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt thereof the treasurer shall deposit such moneys in the benefit account, and shall disburse such moneys upon warrants drawn by the director of the department of administrative services pursuant to the order of the department for the payment of benefits solely from such benefit account. Expenditures of such moneys from the benefit account and refunds from the clearing account shall not be subject to any provisions of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody. All warrants issued by the director of the department of administrative services for the payment of benefits and refunds shall bear the signature of the director of the department of administrative services. Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned shall either be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for the payment of, benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the department, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States, to the credit of this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund, as provided in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. Money credited under section 903 of the Social Security Act.\n\na. (1) Money credited to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section 903 of the Social Security Act may not be requisitioned from this state’s account or used except for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter. Such money may be requisitioned pursuant to subsection 3 of this section for the payment of benefits. Such money may also be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter but only pursuant to a specific appropriation by the legislature and only if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of an appropriation law which:\n\n(a) Specifies the purposes for which such money is appropriated and the amounts appropriated therefor;\n\n(b) Limits the period within which such money may be obligated to a period ending not more than two years after the date of the enactment of the appropriation law; and\n\n(c) Limits the amount which may be obligated during a twelve-month period beginning on July 1 and ending on the next June 30 to an amount which does not exceed the amount by which the aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of this state pursuant to section 903 of the Social Security Act exceeds the aggregate of the amounts used by this state pursuant to this chapter and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of this state during the same twelve-month period.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, amounts used by this state for administration shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into. The use of money appropriated under this subsection shall be accounted for in accordance with standards established by the United States secretary of labor.\n\nb. Money requisitioned as provided in this subsection for the payment of expenses of administration shall be deposited in the employment security administration fund, but, until expended, shall remain a part of the unemployment compensation fund. The treasurer of state shall maintain a separate record of the deposit, obligation, expenditure, and return of funds so deposited. Any money so deposited which either will not be obligated within the period specified by the appropriation law or remains unobligated at the end of the period, and any money which has been obligated within the period but will not be expended, shall be returned promptly to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund.\n\n5. Administration expenses excluded. Any amount credited to this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund under section 903 of the Social Security Act which has been appropriated for expenses of administration pursuant to subsection 4, whether or not withdrawn from such account, shall not be deemed assets of the unemployment compensation fund for the purpose of computing contribution rates under section 96.7, subsection 3.\n\n6. Management of funds in the event of discontinuance of unemployment trust fund. The provisions of subsections 1, 2, and 3 to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund shall be operative only so long as such unemployment trust fund continues to exist and so long as the secretary of the treasury of the United States continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state’s proportionate share of the earnings of such unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein, belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such moneys, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the director, treasurer of state, and governor, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided that such moneys shall be invested in such readily marketable classes of securities as are authorized by the laws of the state of Iowa for the investment of trust funds. The treasurer shall dispose of securities and other properties belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under the direction of the director, treasurer of state, and governor.\n\n7. Cancellation of warrants. The director of the department of administrative services, as of January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year, shall stop payment on all warrants for the payment of benefits which have been outstanding and unredeemed by the state treasurer for six months or longer. Should the original warrants subsequently be presented for payment, warrants in lieu thereof shall be issued by the director of the department of administrative services at the discretion of and certification by the department.\n\n8. Unemployment compensation reserve fund.\n\na. A special fund to be known as the unemployment compensation reserve fund is created in the state treasury. The reserve fund is separate and distinct from the unemployment compensation fund. All moneys collected as reserve contributions, as defined in paragraph “b”, shall be deposited in the reserve fund. The moneys in the reserve fund may be used for the payment of unemployment benefits and shall remain available for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The treasurer of state shall be the custodian of the reserve fund and shall disburse the moneys in the reserve fund in accordance with this subsection and the directions of the director of the department of workforce development.\n\nb. If the balance in the reserve fund on July 1 of the preceding calendar year for calendar year 2004 and each year thereafter is less than one hundred fifty million dollars, a percentage of contributions, as determined by the director, shall be deemed to be reserve contributions for the following calendar year. If the percentage of contributions, termed the reserve contribution tax rate, is not zero percent as determined pursuant to this subsection, the combined tax rate of contributions to the unemployment compensation fund and to the unemployment compensation reserve fund shall be divided so that a minimum of fifty percent of the combined tax rate equals the unemployment contribution tax rate and a maximum of fifty percent of the combined tax rate equals the reserve contribution tax rate except for employers who are assigned a combined tax rate of five and four-tenths. For those employers, the reserve contribution tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal their unemployment contribution rate. When the reserve contribution tax rate is determined to be zero percent, the unemployment contribution rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined tax rate. The reserve contributions collected in any calendar year shall not exceed fifty million dollars. The provisions for collection of contributions under section 96.14 are applicable to the collection of reserve contributions. Reserve contributions shall not be deducted in whole or in part by any employer from the wages of individuals in its employ. All moneys collected as reserve contributions shall not become part of the unemployment compensation fund but shall be deposited in the reserve fund created in this subsection.\n\nc. Moneys in the reserve fund shall only be used to pay unemployment benefits to the extent moneys in the unemployment compensation fund are insufficient to pay benefits during a calendar quarter.\n\nd. The interest earned on the moneys in the reserve fund shall be deposited in and credited to the reserve fund.\n\ne. Moneys from interest earned on the unemployment compensation reserve fund shall be used by the department only upon appropriation by the general assembly and for administrative costs to collect the reserve contributions.\n\n[C39, §1551.15; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.9]\n\n86 Acts, ch 1246, §622; 87 Acts, ch 222, §5; 91 Acts, ch 45, §7, 8; 92 Acts, ch 1045, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 2003 Acts, ch 145, §286; 2003 Acts, ch 179, §32, 47\n\n; 2004 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §30, 32\n\n; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §178; 2009 Acts, ch 41, §30; 2010 Acts, ch 1061, §13; 2015 Acts, ch 30, §34; 2016 Acts, ch 1011, §22; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §47\n\nReferred to in §96.13, 96.20",

All moneys which are deposited or paid into this fund are hereby appropriated and made available to the department. All moneys in this fund, except money received pursuant to section 96.9, subsection 4, which are received from the federal government or any agency thereof or which are appropriated by the state for the purposes described in section 96.12 shall be expended solely for the purposes and in the amounts found necessary by the secretary of labor for the proper and efficient administration of this chapter. This fund shall consist of all moneys appropriated by this state, and all moneys received from the United States, or any agency thereof, including the department of labor, the railroad retirement board, the United States employment service, established under the Wagner-Peyser Act, or from any other source for such purpose. Moneys received from the railroad retirement board, or any other agency, as compensation for services or facilities supplied to said board or agency shall be paid to the department, and the department shall allocate said moneys to the employment security administration fund. All moneys in this fund shall be deposited, administered, and disbursed, in the same manner and under the same conditions and requirements as is provided by law for special funds in the state treasury. Any balances in this fund shall not lapse at any time, but shall be continuously available to the department for expenditure consistent with this chapter. The state treasurer shall give a separate and additional bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of the treasurer’s duties in connection with the employment security administration fund in an amount and with such sureties as shall be fixed and approved by the governor. The premiums for such bond and the premiums for the bond given by the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund under section 96.9, shall be paid from the moneys in the employment security administration fund. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, all money requisitioned and deposited in this fund pursuant to section 96.9, subsection 4, paragraph “b”, shall remain part of the unemployment compensation fund and shall be used only in accordance with the conditions specified in section 96.9, subsection 4.\n\n2. Replenishment of lost funds. If any moneys received after June 30, 1941, from the social security administration under Tit. III of the Social Security Act, or any unencumbered balances in the unemployment compensation administration fund as of that date, or any moneys granted after that date to this state pursuant to the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, or any moneys made available by this state or its political subdivisions and matched by such moneys granted to this state pursuant to the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, are found by the social security administration, because of any action or contingency, to have been lost or been expended for purposes other than or in amounts in excess of, those found necessary by the social security administration for the proper administration of this chapter, it is the policy of this state that such moneys shall be replaced by moneys appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of this state to the unemployment compensation administration fund for expenditure as provided in subsection 1. Upon receipt of notice of such a finding by the social security administration, the department shall promptly report the amount required for such replacement to the governor and the governor shall at the earliest opportunity, submit to the legislature a request for the appropriation of such amount.\n\n3. Special employment security contingency fund.\n\na. (1) There is created in the state treasury a special fund to be known as the special employment security contingency fund. All interest, fines, and penalties, regardless of when they become payable, collected from employers under section 96.14 shall be paid into the fund. The moneys shall not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner which would permit their substitution for federal funds which would in the absence of the moneys be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the department. However, the moneys may be used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of the expenditures against the funds when received. The moneys may be used for the payment of costs of administration which are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal grants or other funds, received for the department. The moneys in the fund are specifically made available to replace, within a reasonable time, any moneys received by this state in the form of grants from the federal government for administrative expenses which because of any action or contingency have been expended for purposes other than, or in excess of, those necessary for the proper administration of the department. All moneys in the fund shall be deposited, administered, and disbursed in the same manner and under the same conditions and requirements as are provided by law for other special funds in the state treasury. Interest earned upon moneys in the fund shall be deposited in and credited to the fund.\n\n(2) The treasurer of state shall be the custodian of the fund and shall give a separate and additional bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of the treasurer’s duties in connection with the fund in an amount and with sureties as shall be fixed and approved by the governor. The premium for the bond shall be paid from the moneys in the fund. All sums recovered on the bond for losses sustained by the fund shall be deposited in the fund. Refunds of interest and penalties shall be paid only from the fund.\n\n(3) Balances to the credit of the fund shall not lapse at any time but shall continuously be available to the department for expenditures consistent with this subsection. Moneys remaining in the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any fund and shall remain in the fund.\n\nb. The department shall annually report to the joint economic development appropriations subcommittee on its plans for expenditures during the next state fiscal year from the special employment security contingency fund. The report shall describe the specific expenditures and explain why the expenditures are to be made from the fund and not from federal administrative funds.\n\nc. The department may appear before the executive council and request authorization of moneys to meet unanticipated emergencies as an expense from the appropriations addressed in section 7D.29.\n\n[C39, §1551.19; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.13; 82 Acts, ch 1126, §2]\n\n84 Acts, ch 1204, §1 – 3; 86 Acts, ch 1209, §2; 91 Acts, ch 45, §10; 92 Acts, ch 1242, §19; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 98 Acts, ch 1074, §10; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2011 Acts, ch 131, §24, 158; 2013 Acts, ch 30, §20; 2016 Acts, ch 1073, §19\n\nReferred to in §96.17",

      "text": "96.14 Priority — refunds.\n\n1. Interest. Any employer who fails to pay any contribution and fails to pay the contribution at the time required by this chapter and the rules of the department, shall pay to the department in addition to the contribution, interest on the contribution at the rate of one percent per month and one-thirtieth of one percent for each day or fraction thereof computed from the date upon which the contribution should have been paid.\n\n2. Penalties. Any employer who shall fail to file a report of wages paid to each of the employer’s employees for any period in the manner and within the time required by this chapter and the rules of the department or any employer who the department finds has filed an insufficient report and fails to file a sufficient report within thirty days after a written request from the department to do so shall pay a penalty to the department.\n\na. The penalty shall become effective with the first day the report is delinquent or, where a report is insufficient, with the thirty-first day following the written request for a sufficient report.\n\nb. The penalty for failing to file a sufficient report shall be in addition to any penalty incurred for a delinquent report where the delinquent report is also insufficient.\n\nc. The amount of the penalty for delinquent and insufficient reports shall be computed based on total wages in the period for which the report was due and shall be computed as follows:\n\nDays Delinquent\n\nor Insufficient Penalty Rate\n\n1 – 60 0.1%\n\n61 – 120 0.2%\n\n121 – 180 0.3%\n\n181 – 240 0.4%\n\n241 or over 0.5%\n\nd. A penalty shall not be less than thirty-five dollars for each delinquent or insufficient report. Interest, penalties, and cost shall be collected by the department in the same manner as provided by this chapter for contributions.\n\ne. If the department finds that any employer has willfully failed to pay any contribution or part thereof when required by this chapter and the rules of the department, with intent to defraud the department, then such employer shall in addition to such contribution or part thereof, pay a contribution equal to fifty percent of the amount of such contribution or part thereof, as the case may be.\n\nf. If any tendered payment of any amount due in the form of a check, draft, or money order is not honored when presented to a financial institution, any costs assessed to the department by the financial institution and a fee of thirty dollars shall be assessed to the employer.\n\ng. The department may cancel any interest or penalties if it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that the failure to pay a required contribution or to file a required report was not the result of negligence, fraud, or intentional disregard of the law or the rules of the department.\n\n3. Lien of contributions — collection.\n\na. Whenever any employer liable to pay contributions refuses or neglects to pay the same, the amount, including any interest, together with the costs that may accrue in addition thereto, shall be a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to said employer. An assessment of the unpaid contributions, interest and penalty shall be applied as provided in section 96.7, subsection 3, paragraphs “a” and “b”, and the lien shall attach as of the date the assessment is mailed or personally served upon the employer and shall continue for ten years, or until the liability for the amount is satisfied, unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. The lien may, within ten years from the date the lien attaches, be extended for up to an additional ten years by filing a notice during the ninth year with the appropriate county official of any county. However, the department may release any lien, when after diligent investigation and effort it determines that the amount due is not collectible.\n\nb. In order to preserve the lien attached to any property situated in a county under paragraph “a” against subsequent mortgagees, purchasers, or judgment creditors for value and without notice of the lien, the department shall file with the recorder of the county in which the property is located, a notice of the lien.\n\nc. The county recorder of each county shall prepare and keep in the recorder’s office an index containing the applicable entries specified in sections 558.49 and 558.52 and showing the following data, under the names of employers, arranged alphabetically:\n\n(1) The name of the employer.\n\n(2) The name “State of Iowa” as claimant.\n\n(3) Time notice of lien was filed for recording.\n\n(4) Date of notice.\n\n(5) Amount of lien then due.\n\n(6) When satisfied.\n\nd. The recorder shall endorse on each notice of lien the day, hour, and minute when filed for recording and the document reference number, shall index the notice in the index, and shall record the lien in the manner provided for recording real estate mortgages. The lien is effective from the time of the indexing of the lien.\n\ne. The department shall pay recording fees as provided in section 331.604, for the recording of the lien, or for its satisfaction.\n\nf. Upon the payment of contributions as to which the department has filed notice with a county recorder, the department shall forthwith file with said recorder a satisfaction of said contributions and the recorder shall enter said satisfaction on the notice on file in the recorder’s office and indicate said fact on the index aforesaid.\n\ng. The department shall, substantially as provided in this chapter and chapter 626, proceed to collect all contributions as soon as practicable after they become delinquent, except that no property of the employer is exempt from payment of the contributions.\n\nh. If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions or interest thereon, the amount due may be collected by civil action in the name of the department and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of such action. Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions or interest thereon from an employer shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under this chapter and cases arising under the workers’ compensation law of this state.\n\ni. It is expressly provided that the remedies of the state under this section shall be cumulative and that no action taken by the department shall be construed to be an election on the part of the state or any of its officers to pursue any remedy under this section to the exclusion of any other remedy provided by law.\n\nj. The courts of this state shall recognize and enforce liabilities for unemployment contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments imposed by other states which extend a like comity to this state. The department may sue in the courts of any other jurisdiction which extends such comity to collect unemployment contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments due this state. The officials of other states which, by statute or otherwise, extend a like comity to this state may sue in the district court to collect for such contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments. In any such case the director, as agent for and on behalf of any other state, may institute and conduct such suit for such other state. Venue of such proceedings shall be the same as for actions to collect delinquent contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments due under this chapter. A certificate by the secretary of any such state attesting the authority of such official to collect the contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments is conclusive evidence of such authority. The requesting state shall pay the court costs.\n\nk. If a political subdivision or a political subdivision instrumentality becomes delinquent in the payment of contributions, any payments owed as a government employer, penalty, interest, and costs for more than two calendar quarters, the amount of such delinquency shall be deducted from any further moneys due the employer by the state. Such deduction shall be made by the director of the department of administrative services upon certification of the amount due. A copy of the certification will be mailed to the employer.\n\nl. If an amount due from a governmental entity of this state remains due and unpaid for a period of one hundred twenty days after the due date, the director shall take action as necessary to collect the amount and shall levy against any funds due the governmental entity from the state treasurer, director of the department of administrative services, or any other official or agency of this state, or against an account established by the entity in any bank. The official, agency, or bank shall deduct the amount certified by the director from any accounts or deposits or any funds due the delinquent governmental entity without regard to any prior claim and shall promptly forward the amount to the director for the fund. However, the director shall notify the delinquent entity of the director’s intent to file a levy by certified mail at least ten days prior to filing the levy on any funds due the entity from any state official or agency.\n\n4. Priorities under legal dissolutions or distributions. In the event of any distribution of an employer’s assets pursuant to an order of any court under the laws of this state, including any receivership, assignment for benefit of creditors, adjudicated insolvency, composition, or similar proceeding, contributions then or thereafter due shall be paid in full prior to all other claims except taxes and claims for wages preferred as provided by statute. In the event of an employer’s adjudication in bankruptcy, judicially confirmed extension proposal, or composition, under the federal Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended, contributions then or thereafter due shall be entitled to such priority as is provided in section 64 “a” of that Act, 11 U.S.C. §507.\n\n5. Refunds, compromises, and settlements. If the department finds that an employer has paid contributions, interest on contributions, or penalties, which have been erroneously paid or if the employer has overpaid contributions because the employer’s contribution rate was subsequently reduced pursuant to section 96.7, subsection 2, paragraph “e”, solely due to benefits initially charged against but later removed from an employer’s account, and the employer has filed an application for refund, the department shall refund the erroneous payment or overpayment. Refunds so made shall be charged to the fund to which the collections have been credited, and shall be paid to the employer without interest. A claim for refund shall be made within three years from the date of payment. For like cause, refunds, compromises, and settlements may be made by the department on its own initiative within three years of the date of the payment or assessment. If the department finds that the contribution that has been assessed against an employer is of doubtful collectibility or may not be collected in full, the department may institute a proceeding in the district court in the county in which the employer against which the tax is levied is located, requesting authority to compromise the contribution. Notice of the filing of an application shall be given to the interested parties as the court may prescribe. The court upon hearing may authorize the department to compromise and settle its claim for the contribution and shall fix the amount to be received by the department in full settlement of the claim and shall authorize the release of the department’s lien for the contribution.\n\n6. Nonresident employing units. Any employing unit which is a nonresident of the state of Iowa and for which services are performed in insured work within the state of Iowa and any resident employer for which such services are performed and who thereafter leaves the state of Iowa by having such services performed within the state of Iowa shall be deemed:\n\na.

To agree that any original notice of suit or any other legal process so served upon such nonresident employing unit shall be of the same legal force and validity as if personally served on it in this state.\n\n7. Original notice — form. The original notice of suit filed with the secretary of state shall be in form and substance the same as now provided in suits against residents of this state, except that the part of the notice pertaining to the return day shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nAnd unless you appear and defend in the district court of Iowa in and for ........................ county at the courthouse in ........................, Iowa, before noon of the sixtieth day following the filing of this notice with the secretary of state of this state, you will be adjudged in default, your default entered of record, and judgment rendered against you for the relief sought in plaintiff’s petition.\n\n8. Manner of service. Plaintiff in any such action shall cause the original notice of suit to be served by doing all of the following:\n\na. Filing a copy of the original notice of suit with the secretary of state, together with a fee of four dollars.\n\nb. Mailing to the defendant, and to each of the defendants if more than one, within ten days after filing the notice with the secretary of state, by restricted certified mail addressed to the defendant at the defendant’s last known residence or place of abode, a notification of the filing with the secretary of state.\n\n9. Notification to nonresident — form. The notification, provided for in subsection 7, shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nTo ........................ (Here insert the name of each defendant and the defendant’s residence or last known place of abode as definitely as known.)\n\nYou will take notice that an original notice of suit against you, a copy of which is hereto attached, was duly served upon you at Des Moines, Iowa, by filing a copy of said notice on the ............ day of ................ (month), ........ (year), with the secretary of state of the state of Iowa.\n\nDated at ........................, Iowa, this ............ day of ................ (month), ........ (year).\n\n....................................\n\nBy ............................\n\nAttorney for Plaintiff.\n\n10. Optional notification. In lieu of mailing said notification to the defendant in a foreign state, plaintiff may cause said notification to be personally served in the foreign state on the defendant by any adult person not a party to the suit, by delivering said notification to the defendant or by offering to make such delivery in case defendant refuses to accept delivery.\n\n11. Proof of service. Proof of the filing of a copy of said original notice of suit with the secretary of state, and proof of the mailing or personal delivery of said notification to said nonresident shall be made by affidavit of the party doing said acts. All affidavits of service shall be endorsed upon or attached to the originals of the papers to which they relate. All proofs of service, including the restricted certified mail return receipt, shall be forthwith filed with the clerk of the district court.\n\n12. Actual service within this state. The foregoing provisions relative to service of original notice of suit on nonresidents shall not be deemed to prevent actual personal service in this state upon the nonresident in the time, manner, form, and under the conditions provided for service on residents.\n\n13. Venue of actions. Actions against nonresidents as contemplated by this law may be brought in Polk county or in the county in which such services were performed.\n\n14. Continuances.

Injunction upon nonpayment. Any employer or employing unit refusing or failing to make and file required reports or records, or to pay any contributions, interest, or penalty under the provisions of this chapter, after ten days’ written notice sent by the department to the employer’s or employing unit’s last known address by certified mail, may be enjoined from operating any business in the state while in violation of this chapter upon the complaint of the department in the district court of a county in which the employer or employing unit has or had a place of business within the state, and any temporary injunction enjoining the continuance of such business may be granted without notice and without a bond being required from the department. Such injunction may enjoin any employer or employing unit from operating a business unit until the delinquent contributions, interest, or penalties shall have been made and filed or paid; or the employer shall have furnished a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon the payment of such delinquencies in such an amount and containing such terms as may be determined by the court; or the employer has entered into a plan for the liquidation of the business to pay for such delinquencies as the court may approve, provided that such injunction may be reinstated upon the employer’s failure to comply with the terms of said plan.\n\n17. Employer subpoena cost and penalty. An employer who is served with a subpoena pursuant to section 96.11, subsection 7, for the investigation of an employer liability issue, to complete audits, to secure reports, or to assess contributions shall pay all costs associated with the subpoena, including service fees and court costs.

Eligibility requirements for extended benefits. An individual is eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to a week of unemployment in the individual’s eligibility period only if the department finds that all of the following conditions are met:\n\na. The individual is an “exhaustee” as defined in this chapter.\n\nb. The individual has satisfied the requirements of this chapter for the receipt of regular benefits that are applicable to individuals claiming extended benefits, including not being subject to a disqualification for the receipt of benefits.\n\nc. The individual has been paid wages for insured work during the individual’s base period in an amount at least one and one-half times the wages paid to the individual during that quarter of the individual’s base period in which the individual’s wages were highest.\n\n2. Disqualification for extended benefits. If an individual claiming extended benefits furnishes satisfactory evidence to the department that the individual’s prospects for obtaining work in the individual’s customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, section 96.5, subsection 3 applies. If the department determines that an individual is claiming extended benefits and the individual’s prospects for obtaining work in the individual’s customary occupation are poor, the following paragraphs apply:\n\na. An individual shall be disqualified for extended benefits if the individual fails to apply for or refuses to accept an offer of suitable work to which the individual was referred by the department or the individual fails to actively seek work, unless the individual has been employed during at least four weeks, which need not be consecutive, subsequent to the disqualification and has earned at least four times the individual’s weekly extended benefit amount. In order to be considered suitable work under this subsection, the gross weekly wage for the suitable work shall be in excess of the individual’s weekly extended benefit amount plus any weekly supplemental unemployment compensation benefits which the individual is receiving.\n\nb. An individual shall not be disqualified for extended benefits for failing to apply for or refusing to accept an offer of suitable work, unless the suitable work was offered to the individual in writing or was listed with the department.\n\nc. This subsection shall not apply to claims for extended benefits if otherwise prohibited by federal law.\n\n3. Weekly extended benefit amount. The weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in the individual’s eligibility period is an amount equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to the individual during the individual’s applicable benefit year.\n\n4. Total extended benefit amount.\n\na. The total extended benefit amount payable to an eligible individual with respect to the individual’s applicable benefit year is the least of the following amounts:\n\n(1) Fifty percent of the total amount of regular benefits which were payable to the individual under this chapter in the individual’s applicable benefit year.\n\n(2) Thirteen times the individual’s weekly benefit amount which was payable to the individual under this chapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year.\n\nb. Except for the first two weeks of an interstate claim for extended benefits filed in any state under the interstate benefit payment plan and payable from an individual’s extended benefit account, the individual is not eligible for extended benefits payable under the interstate claim if an extended benefit period is not in effect in that state.\n\n5. Beginning and termination of extended benefit period. If an extended benefit period is to become effective in Iowa as a result of the state “on” indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be terminated in Iowa as a result of the state “off” indicator, the department shall make an appropriate public announcement. Computations required by this subsection shall be made by the department in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States secretary of labor.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if the benefit year of an individual ends within an eligibility period for extended benefits, the remaining extended benefits which the individual would, but for this section, be entitled to receive in that portion of the eligibility period which extends beyond the end of the individual’s benefit year, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the number of weeks for which the individual received federal trade readjustment allowances, under 19 U.S.C. §2101 et seq., as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, within the individual’s benefit year multiplied by the individual’s weekly extended benefit amount.\n\n[C73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §96.29; 81 Acts, ch 19, §10, 11; 82 Acts, ch 1030, §8, 9]\n\n93 Acts, ch 10, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2017 Acts, ch 29, §34\n\nReferred to in §96.11, 96.40",

An employer who wishes to participate in the shared work unemployment compensation program established under this section shall submit a written shared work plan in a form acceptable to the department for approval.\n\na. As a condition for approval by the department, a participating employer shall agree to furnish the department with reports relating to the operation of the shared work plan as requested by the department.\n\nb. The employer shall monitor and evaluate the operation of the established shared work plan as requested by the department and shall report the findings to the department.\n\n2. The department may approve a shared work plan if all of the following conditions are met:\n\na. The employer has filed all reports required to be filed under this chapter for all past and current periods and has paid all contributions due for all past and current periods.\n\nb. The plan certifies that the aggregate reduction in work hours is in lieu of layoffs which would have affected at least ten percent of the employees in the affected unit or units to which the plan applies and which would have resulted in an equivalent reduction in work hours. The employer provides an estimate of the number of layoffs that would occur absent participation in the program. “Affected unit” means a specified plant, department, shift, or other definable unit.\n\nc. The employees in the affected unit are identified by name and social security number and consist of at least five individuals.\n\nd. The shared work plan reduces the normal weekly hours of work for an employee in the affected unit by not less than twenty percent and not more than fifty percent with a corresponding reduction in wages.\n\ne. The reduction in hours and corresponding reduction in wages must be applied equally to all employees in the affected unit for each week reported.\n\nf. The plan provides that fringe benefits will continue to be provided to employees in affected units as though their workweeks had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the program. “Fringe benefits” means employer-provided health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.\n\ng. The plan will not serve as a subsidy of seasonal employment during the off season, nor as a subsidy of temporary part-time or intermittent employment.\n\nh. The employer certifies that the employer will not hire additional part-time or full-time employees for the affected work force while the program is in operation.\n\ni. The duration of the shared work plan will not exceed fifty-two weeks.\n\nj. The plan is approved in writing by the collective bargaining representative for each employee organization or union which has members in the affected unit, and the plan provides for notification to employees in advance of participation.\n\nk. Participation by the employer shall be consistent with applicable federal and state laws.\n\nl. The reduction in work hours for employees was not based on a work week exceeding forty hours.\n\n3. The employer shall submit a shared work plan to the department for approval at least thirty days prior to the proposed implementation date.\n\n4. The department may revoke approval of a shared work plan and terminate the plan if the department determines that the shared work plan is not being executed according to the terms and intent of the shared work unemployment compensation program, or if it is determined by the department that the approval of the shared work plan was based, in whole or in part, upon information contained in the plan which was either false or substantially misleading.\n\n5. Approval of a shared work plan shall be revoked if the employer lays off any employee, whether the employee is employed within an affected unit or not, while participating in the shared work unemployment compensation program.\n\n6. An employer may file an appeal in writing from a denial or approval of a plan or revocation of an approved plan by the department within thirty days from the date of the decision.\n\n7. An individual who is otherwise entitled to receive regular unemployment compensation benefits under this chapter shall be eligible to receive shared work benefits with respect to any week in which the department finds all of the following:\n\na. The individual is employed as a member of an affected unit subject to a shared work plan that was approved before the week in question and is in effect for that week.\n\nb. The individual is able to work, available for work, and works all available hours with the participating employer.\n\nc. The individual’s normal weekly hours of work have been reduced by at least twenty percent but not more than fifty percent, with a corresponding reduction in wages.\n\n8. The department shall not deny shared work benefits for any week to an otherwise eligible individual by reason of the application of any provision of this chapter which relates to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to apply for or accept work with an employer other than the participating employer under the plan.\n\n9. The department shall pay an individual who is eligible for shared work benefits under this section a weekly shared work benefit amount equal to the individual’s regular weekly benefit amount for a period of total unemployment, less any deductible amounts under this chapter except wages received from any employer, multiplied by the full percentage of reduction in the individual’s hours as set forth in the employer’s shared work plan. If the shared work benefit amount calculated under this subsection is not a multiple of one dollar, the department shall round the amount so calculated to the next lowest multiple of one dollar. An individual shall be eligible for shared work benefits for any week in which the individual performs paid work for the participating employer for a number of hours equal to not less than twenty percent and not more than fifty percent of the normal weekly hours of work for the employee.\n\n10. An individual shall not be entitled to receive shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits in an aggregate amount which exceeds the maximum total amount of benefits payable to that individual in a benefit year as provided under section 96.3, subsection 5, paragraph “a”.\n\n11. a. All benefits paid under a shared work plan shall be charged in the manner provided in this chapter for the charging of regular benefits.\n\nb. An employer may provide as part of the plan a training program the employees may attend during the hours that have been reduced. Such a training program may include a training program funded under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, Pub. L. No. 113-128. If the employer is able to show that the training program will provide a substantive increase in the workplace and employability skills of the employee so as to reduce the potential for future periods of unemployment, the department shall relieve the employer of charges for benefits paid to the individual attending training under the plan. The employee may attend the training at the work site utilizing internal resources, provided the training is outside of the normal course of employment, or in conjunction with an educational institution.\n\n12. An individual who has received all of the shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits available in a benefit year shall be considered an exhaustee, as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 18, for purposes of the extended benefit program administered pursuant to section 96.29.\n\n13. A part-time employee shall be eligible for shared work unemployment compensation program benefits, provided that the employee meets all other requirements in this section.\n\n91 Acts, ch 197, §1; 94 Acts, ch 1066, §7\n\n; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23\n\n; 97 Acts, ch 38, §5; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2009 Acts, ch 22, §7; 2009 Acts, ch 179, §111, 112; 2010 Acts, ch 1110, §1; 2014 Acts, ch 1034, §1 – 4; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §91; 2020 Acts, ch 1088, §2 – 5; 2021 Acts, ch 76, §25; 2022 Acts, ch 1136, §8, 9\n\n2020 amendments to subsection 2, paragraph e, and subsections 6 and 11 apply to all voluntary shared work plans approved by the department of workforce development on or after July 1, 2020; 2020 Acts, ch 1088, §5",
