If a political subdivision seeks to discontinue its own inspections prior to December 31, 2013, the political subdivision shall petition the board. On or after January 1, 2014, if a unanimous vote of the board finds that a political subdivision’s inspections are inadequate by reason of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance, the board may suspend or revoke the political subdivision’s authority to perform its own inspections, subject to appeal according to the procedure set forth in section 103.34 and judicial review pursuant to section 17A.19. A political subdivision not performing electrical inspections prior to December 31, 2007, may make provision for inspection of electrical installations within its jurisdiction, in which case it shall keep on file with the board copies of its current inspection ordinances or resolutions and electrical codes.\n\n2.

A political subdivision which begins performing electrical inspections after December 31, 2007, shall maintain the specified three-to-one ratio unless the board approves a petition by the political subdivision for a lower ratio. A political subdivision which discontinues performing electrical inspections and permits the board to have jurisdiction over inspections shall maintain the specified three-to-one supervision ratio, and may not petition for a lower ratio unless the political subdivision subsequently resumes performing electrical inspections.\n\n3. A political subdivision that performs electrical inspections may set appropriate permit fees to pay for such inspections. A political subdivision shall not require any person holding a license from the board to pay any license fee or take any examination if the person holds a current license issued by the board which is of a classification equal to or greater than the classification needed to do the work proposed. Any such political subdivision may provide a requirement that each person doing electrical work within the jurisdiction of such political subdivision have on file with the political subdivision a copy of the current license issued by the board or such other evidence of such license as may be provided by the board.\n\n4.

A political subdivision that performs electrical inspections shall act as the authority having jurisdiction for electrical inspections and for amending the national electrical code adopted by the board pursuant to section 103.6 for work performed within the jurisdictional limits of the political subdivision, provided those inspections and amendments conform to the requirements of this chapter. Any action by a political subdivision with respect to amendments to the national electrical code shall be filed with the board prior to enforcement by the political subdivision, and shall not be less stringent than the minimum standards established by the board by rule.\n\n6.
