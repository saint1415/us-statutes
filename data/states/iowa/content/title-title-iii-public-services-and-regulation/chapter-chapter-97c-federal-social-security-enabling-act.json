With respect to employees of the state the governor is empowered to authorize a referendum, and with respect to the employees of any political subdivision the governor shall authorize a referendum upon request of the governing body of such subdivision; and in either case the referendum shall be conducted, and the governor shall designate an agency or individual to supervise its conduct, in accordance with the requirements of section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act, on the question of whether service in positions covered by a retirement system established by the state or by a political subdivision thereof should be excluded from or included under an agreement under this chapter. The notice of referendum required by section 218(d)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act to be given to employees shall contain or shall be accomplished by a statement, in such form and such detail as the agency or individual designated to supervise the referendum shall deem necessary and sufficient, to inform the employees of the rights which will accrue to them and their dependents and survivors, and the liabilities to which they will be subject, if their services are included under an agreement under this chapter.\n\n2. Upon receiving evidence satisfactory to the governor that with respect to any such referendum the conditions specified in section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act have been met, the governor shall so certify to the secretary of health and human services.\n\n[C58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §97C.20]\n\n83 Acts, ch 101, §11; 2015 Acts, ch 29, §17",

Alternatively, the governor may authorize a statewide referendum of the appointed and elected officials of the state and its political subdivisions on the question of whether to include in or exclude from the definition of employee all such positions. This choice shall be reflected in the federal-state agreement described in section 97C.3, and, if necessary, in this chapter. An employer who is providing benefits to elected officials otherwise excluded from the definition of employee prior to July 1, 2002, shall not be deemed to be in an erroneous reporting situation, and corrections for prior federal social security withholdings shall not be required. The implementation of this section shall be subject to the approval of the federal social security administration.\n\n2002 Acts, ch 1135, §35; 2008 Acts, ch 1171, §60",
