Persons engaged in agriculture, insofar as injuries incurred by employees while engaged in agricultural pursuits or any operations immediately connected therewith whether on or off the premises of the employer, except:\n\na. This chapter applies to persons not specifically exempted by paragraph “b” of this subsection if at the time of injury the person is employed by an employer whose total cash payroll to one or more persons other than those exempted by paragraph “b” of this subsection amounted to two thousand five hundred dollars or more during the preceding calendar year.\n\nb.

The purchase of and acceptance by an employer of valid workers’ compensation insurance applicable to the employee or classification of employees constitutes an assumption by the employer of liability without any further act on the part of the employer, but only with respect to the employee or classification of employees as are within the coverage of the workers’ compensation insurance contract and only for the time period in which the insurance contract is in force. Upon an election of such coverage, the employee or classification of employees shall accept compensation in the manner provided by this chapter and the employer shall be relieved from any other liability for recovery of damage, or other compensation for injury.\n\n[S13, §2477-m; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §1361; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §85.1; 82 Acts, ch 1161, §1, 2, ch 1221, §1]\n\n83 Acts, ch 36, §1, 2, 8; 84 Acts, ch 1067, §14; 96 Acts, ch 1059, §1; 97 Acts, ch 43, §1, 2; 2007 Acts, ch 128, §1; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §26\n\nReferred to in §85.2, 85.61, 85.62, 87.21",

When an injured employee or the employee’s legal representative brings an action against such third party, a copy of the original notice shall be served upon the employer by the plaintiff, not less than ten days before the trial of the case, but a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the rights of the employer, and the following rights and duties shall ensue:\n\n1. If compensation is paid the employee or dependent or the trustee of such dependent under this chapter, the employer by whom the same was paid, or the employer’s insurer which paid it, shall be indemnified out of the recovery of damages to the extent of the payment so made, with legal interest, except for such attorney fees as may be allowed, by the district court, to the injured employee’s attorney or the attorney of the employee’s personal representative, and shall have a lien on the claim for such recovery and the judgment thereon for the compensation for which the employer or insurer is liable. In order to continue and preserve the lien, the employer or insurer shall, within thirty days after receiving notice of such suit from the employee, file, in the office of the clerk of the court where the action is brought, notice of the lien.\n\n2. In case the employee fails to bring such action within ninety days, or where a city or a city under special charter is such third party, within thirty days after written notice so to do given by the employer or the employer’s insurer, as the case may be, then the employer or the insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of the employee to maintain the action against such third party, and may recover damages for the injury to the same extent that the employee might. In case of recovery, the court shall enter judgment for distribution of the proceeds thereof as follows:\n\na. A sum sufficient to repay the employer for the amount of compensation actually paid by the employer to that time.\n\nb. A sum sufficient to pay the employer the present worth, computed at the interest rate provided in section 535.3 for court judgments and decrees, of the future payments of compensation for which the employer is liable, but the sum is not a final adjudication of the future payments which the employee is entitled to receive and if the sum received by the employer is in excess of the amount required to pay the compensation, the excess shall be paid to the employee.\n\nc. The balance, if any, shall be paid over to the employee.\n\n3. Before a settlement shall become effective between an employee or an employer and such third party who is liable for the injury, it must be with the written consent of the employee, in case the settlement is between the employer or insurer and such third person; and the consent of the employer or insurer, in case the settlement is between the employee and such third party; or on refusal of consent, in either case, then upon the written approval of the workers’ compensation commissioner.\n\n4. A written memorandum of any settlement, if made, shall be filed by the employer or insurance carrier in the office of the workers’ compensation commissioner.\n\n5. For subrogation purposes, any payment made unto an injured employee, the employee’s guardian, parent, next friend, or legal representative, by or on behalf of any third party, or the third party’s principal or agent liable for, connected with, or involved in causing an injury to such employee shall be considered as having been so paid as damages resulting from and because said injury was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability against said third party, whether such payment be made under a covenant not to sue, compromise settlement, denial of liability or otherwise.\n\n6.

The employer, for all injuries compensable under this chapter or chapter 85A, shall furnish reasonable surgical, medical, dental, osteopathic, chiropractic, podiatric, physical rehabilitation, nursing, ambulance, and hospital services and supplies therefor and shall allow reasonably necessary transportation expenses incurred for such services. The employer shall also furnish reasonable and necessary crutches, artificial members, and appliances.\n\nb. An employer shall not be required to furnish more than one set of permanent prosthetic devices.\n\nc. Paragraph “b” shall not apply if a permanent prosthetic device is a replacement of a permanent prosthetic device that is medically necessary as a result of a compensable injury that occurred while the employee was employed by the employer and the replacement of the prosthetic device would be considered reasonable medical care under this chapter.\n\n2. Any employee, employer, or insurance carrier making or defending a claim for benefits agrees to the release of all information to which the employee, employer, or carrier has access concerning the employee’s physical or mental condition relative to the claim and further waives any privilege for the release of the information. The information shall be made available to any party or the party’s representative upon request. Any institution or person releasing the information to a party or the party’s representative shall not be liable criminally or for civil damages by reason of the release of the information. If release of information is refused, the party requesting the information may apply to the workers’ compensation commissioner for relief. The information requested shall be submitted to the workers’ compensation commissioner who shall determine the relevance and materiality of the information to the claim and enter an order accordingly.\n\n3. Notwithstanding section 85.26, subsection 4, charges believed to be excessive or unnecessary may be referred by the employer, insurance carrier, or health service provider to the workers’ compensation commissioner for determination, and the commissioner may utilize the procedures provided in sections 10A.326 and 10A.327, or set by rule, and conduct such inquiry as the commissioner deems necessary. Any health service provider charges not in dispute shall be paid directly to the health service provider prior to utilization of procedures provided in sections 10A.326 and 10A.327 or set by rule. A health service provider rendering treatment to an employee whose injury is compensable under this section agrees to be bound by such charges as allowed by the workers’ compensation commissioner and shall not recover in law or equity any amount in excess of charges set by the commissioner. When a dispute under this chapter, chapter 85A, or chapter 85B regarding reasonableness of a fee for medical services arises between a health service provider and an employer or insurance carrier, the health service provider, employer, or insurance carrier shall not seek payment from the injured employee. A health service provider shall not seek payment for fees in dispute from the insurance carrier or employer until the commissioner finds, pursuant to informal dispute resolution procedures established by rule by the commissioner, that the disputed amount is reasonable. This section does not affect the responsibility of an insurance carrier or an employer to pay amounts not in dispute or a health service provider’s right to receive payment from an employee’s nonoccupational plan as provided in section 85.38, subsection 2.\n\n4. For purposes of this section, the employer is obliged to furnish reasonable services and supplies to treat an injured employee, and has the right to choose the care. If the employer chooses the care, the employer shall hold the employee harmless for the cost of care until the employer notifies the employee that the employer is no longer authorizing all or any part of the care and the reason for the change in authorization. An employer is not liable for the cost of care that the employer arranges in response to a sudden emergency if the employee’s condition, for which care was arranged, is not related to the employment. The treatment must be offered promptly and be reasonably suited to treat the injury without undue inconvenience to the employee. If the employee has reason to be dissatisfied with the care offered, the employee should communicate the basis of such dissatisfaction to the employer, in writing if requested, following which the employer and the employee may agree to alternate care reasonably suited to treat the injury. If the employer and employee cannot agree on such alternate care, the commissioner may, upon application and reasonable proofs of the necessity therefor, allow and order other care. In an emergency, the employee may choose the employee’s care at the employer’s expense, provided the employer or the employer’s agent cannot be reached immediately. An application made under this subsection shall be considered an original proceeding for purposes of commencement and contested case proceedings under section 85.26. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 17A. Before a hearing is scheduled, the parties may choose a telephone hearing or an in-person hearing. A request for an in-person hearing shall be approved unless the in-person hearing would be impractical because of the distance between the parties to the hearing. The workers’ compensation commissioner shall issue a decision within ten working days of receipt of an application for alternate care made pursuant to a telephone hearing or within fourteen working days of receipt of an application for alternate care made pursuant to an in-person hearing. The employer shall notify an injured employee of the employee’s ability to contest the employer’s choice of care pursuant to this subsection.\n\n5. a. When an artificial member or orthopedic appliance, whether or not previously furnished by the employer, is damaged or made unusable by circumstances arising out of and in the course of employment other than through ordinary wear and tear, the employer shall repair or replace it. When any crutch, artificial member or appliance, whether or not previously furnished by the employer, either is damaged or made unusable in conjunction with a personal injury entitling the employee to disability benefits or services as provided by this section, or is damaged in connection with employee actions taken which avoid such personal injury, the employer shall repair or replace it.\n\nb. Subject to paragraph “a” but notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an employer shall not be required to provide for the repair or replacement of an employee’s permanent prosthetic device if the employee has an account credited to the employee pursuant to section 85.65, subsection 2, in relation to that permanent prosthetic device.\n\n6. While a contested case proceeding for determination of liability for workers’ compensation benefits is pending before the workers’ compensation commissioner relating to an injury alleged to have given rise to treatment, no debt collection, as defined by section 537.7102, shall be undertaken against an employee or the employee’s dependents for the collection of charges for that treatment rendered an employee by any health service provider. If debt collection is undertaken after a creditor receives actual notice that a contested case proceeding for determination of liability for workers’ compensation benefits is pending, such debt collection shall constitute a prohibited practice under section 537.7103, and the employee or the employee’s dependents are entitled to the remedies provided in section 537.5201. However, the health service provider may send one itemized written bill to the employee setting forth the amount of the charges in connection with the treatment after notification of the contested case proceeding.\n\n7. If, after the third day of incapacity to work following the date of sustaining a compensable injury which does not result in permanent partial disability, or if, at any time after sustaining a compensable injury which results in permanent partial disability, an employee, who is not receiving weekly benefits under section 85.33 or section 85.34, subsection 1, returns to work and is required to leave work for one full day or less to receive services pursuant to this section, the employee shall be paid an amount equivalent to the wages lost at the employee’s regular rate of pay for the time the employee is required to leave work. For the purposes of this subsection, “day of incapacity to work” means eight hours of accumulated absence from work due to incapacity to work or due to the receipt of services pursuant to this section. The employer shall make the payments under this subsection as wages to the employee after making such deductions from the amount as legally required or customarily made by the employer from wages. Payments made under this subsection shall be required to be reimbursed pursuant to any insurance policy covering workers’ compensation. Payments under this subsection shall not be construed to be payment of weekly benefits.\n\n[S13, §2477-m9; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §1387; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §85.27; 82 Acts, ch 1161, §4]\n\n92 Acts, ch 1120, §1; 92 Acts, ch 1181, §1; 94 Acts, ch 1065, §1, 2; 98 Acts, ch 1061, §11; 2001 Acts, ch 87, §2\n\n; 2004 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §9, 18\n\n; 2005 Acts, ch 168, §9, 23; 2007 Acts, ch 22, §20; 2007 Acts, ch 128, §2; 2018 Acts, ch 1041, §27; 2022 Acts, ch 1128, §1, 2\n\nReferred to in §85.26, 85.29, 85.31, 85.34, 85.35, 85.37, 85.38, 85.45, 85.59, 537.7103\n\nSection not amended; internal reference changes applied",

The weekly benefit amount shall not exceed a weekly benefit amount, rounded to the nearest dollar, equal to two hundred percent of the statewide average weekly wage paid employees as determined by the department of workforce development under section 96.1A, subsection 35, and in effect at the time of the injury. The minimum weekly benefit amount shall be equal to the weekly benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly earnings are thirty-five percent of the statewide average weekly wage. Such compensation shall be in addition to the benefits provided by sections 85.27 and 85.28.\n\n2. When the injury causes the death of a minor employee whose earnings were received by the parent and such parent was wholly dependent upon the earnings of the minor employee for support at the time of the injury, the compensation to be paid such parent shall be the weekly compensation for an adult with like earnings. For the purposes of this section a stepparent shall be regarded as a parent only when the stepparent has actually received the stepparent’s principal support from the stepchild who died as a result of compensable injuries.\n\n3. If the employee leaves dependents only partially dependent upon the employee’s earnings for support at the time of the injury, the weekly compensation to be paid as provided in subsections 1 and 2 shall be equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of the injury.\n\n4.

But if the nonresident alien dependent is a citizen of a government having a compensation law which excludes citizens of the United States, either resident or nonresident, from partaking of the benefits of such law in as favorable degree as herein extended to the nonresident alien, then the compensation which would otherwise be payable to the dependent shall be paid into the second injury fund in the custody of the treasurer of state.\n\n[S13, §2477-m9, -m10; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §1392; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §85.31; 82 Acts, ch 1161, §6]\n\n87 Acts, ch 111, §1; 94 Acts, ch 1065, §3; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §169; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §77; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §33; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §27; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1743\n\nReferred to in §85.43, 85.45\n\nSubsection 5 amended",

Temporary partial benefits shall not be considered benefits payable to an employee, upon termination of temporary partial or temporary total disability, the healing period, or permanent partial disability, because the employee is not able to secure work paying weekly earnings equal to the employee’s weekly earnings at the time of injury.\n\n3. a. If an employee is temporarily, partially disabled and the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of injury offers to the employee suitable work consistent with the employee’s disability the employee shall accept the suitable work, and be compensated with temporary partial benefits. If the employer offers the employee suitable work and the employee refuses to accept the suitable work offered by the employer, the employee shall not be compensated with temporary partial, temporary total, or healing period benefits during the period of the refusal. Work offered at the employer’s principal place of business or established place of operation where the employee has previously worked is presumed to be geographically suitable for an employee whose duties involve travel away from the employer’s principal place of business or established place of operation more than fifty percent of the time. If suitable work is not offered by the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the injury and the employee who is temporarily, partially disabled elects to perform work with a different employer, the employee shall be compensated with temporary partial benefits.\n\nb. The employer shall communicate an offer of temporary work to the employee in writing, including details of lodging, meals, and transportation, and shall communicate to the employee that if the employee refuses the offer of temporary work, the employee shall communicate the refusal and the reason for the refusal to the employer in writing and that during the period of the refusal the employee will not be compensated with temporary partial, temporary total, or healing period benefits, unless the work refused is not suitable. If the employee refuses the offer of temporary work on the grounds that the work is not suitable, the employee shall communicate the refusal, along with the reason for the refusal, to the employer in writing at the time the offer of work is refused. Failure to communicate the reason for the refusal in this manner precludes the employee from raising suitability of the work as the reason for the refusal until such time as the reason for the refusal is communicated in writing to the employer.\n\n4. If an employee is entitled to temporary partial benefits under subsection 3 of this section, the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of injury shall pay to the employee weekly compensation benefits, as provided in section 85.32, for and during the period of temporary partial disability. The temporary partial benefit shall be sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between the employee’s weekly earnings at the time of injury, computed in compliance with section 85.36, and the employee’s actual gross weekly income from employment during the period of temporary partial disability. If at the time of injury an employee is paid on the basis of the output of the employee, with a minimum guarantee pursuant to a written employment agreement, the minimum guarantee shall be used as the employee’s weekly earnings at the time of injury. However, the weekly compensation benefits shall not exceed the payments to which the employee would be entitled under section 85.36 or section 85.37, or under subsection 1 of this section.\n\n5.

The loss of the first or distal phalange of the thumb or of any finger shall equal the loss of one-half of such thumb or finger and the weekly compensation shall be paid during one-half of the time but not to exceed one-half of the total amount for the loss of such thumb or finger.\n\ng. The loss of more than one phalange shall equal the loss of the entire finger or thumb.\n\nh. For the loss of a great toe, weekly compensation during forty weeks.\n\ni. For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, weekly compensation during fifteen weeks.\n\nj. The loss of the first phalange of any toe shall equal the loss of one-half of such toe and the weekly compensation shall be paid during one-half of the time but not to exceed one-half of the total amount provided for the loss of such toe.\n\nk. The loss of more than one phalange shall equal the loss of the entire toe.\n\nl. For the loss of a hand, weekly compensation during one hundred ninety weeks.\n\nm. The loss of two-thirds of that part of an arm between the shoulder joint and the elbow joint shall equal the loss of an arm and the compensation therefor shall be weekly compensation during two hundred fifty weeks.\n\nn. For the loss of a shoulder, weekly compensation during four hundred weeks.\n\no. For the loss of a foot, weekly compensation during one hundred fifty weeks.\n\np. The loss of two-thirds of that part of a leg between the hip joint and the knee joint shall equal the loss of a leg, and the compensation therefor shall be weekly compensation during two hundred twenty weeks.\n\nq. For the loss of an eye, weekly compensation during one hundred forty weeks.\n\nr. For the loss of an eye, the other eye having been lost prior to the injury, weekly compensation during two hundred weeks.\n\ns. (1) For the loss of hearing, other than occupational hearing loss as defined in section 85B.4, weekly compensation during fifty weeks, and for the loss of hearing in both ears, weekly compensation during one hundred seventy-five weeks.\n\n(2) For occupational hearing loss, weekly compensation as provided in chapter 85B.\n\nt. The loss of both arms, or both hands, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or any two thereof, caused by a single accident, shall equal five hundred weeks and shall be compensated as such; however, if said employee is permanently and totally disabled the employee may be entitled to benefits under subsection 3.\n\nu. For permanent disfigurement of the face or head which shall impair the future usefulness and earnings of the employee in the employee’s occupation at the time of receiving the injury, weekly compensation, for such period as may be determined by the workers’ compensation commissioner according to the severity of the disfigurement, but not to exceed one hundred fifty weeks.\n\nv. In all cases of permanent partial disability other than those described or referred to in paragraphs “a” through “u”, the compensation shall be paid during the number of weeks in relation to five hundred weeks as the reduction in the employee’s earning capacity caused by the disability bears in relation to the earning capacity that the employee possessed when the injury occurred. A determination of the reduction in the employee’s earning capacity caused by the disability shall take into account the permanent partial disability of the employee and the number of years in the future it was reasonably anticipated that the employee would work at the time of the injury. If an employee who is eligible for compensation under this paragraph returns to work or is offered work for which the employee receives or would receive the same or greater salary, wages, or earnings than the employee received at the time of the injury, the employee shall be compensated based only upon the employee’s functional impairment resulting from the injury, and not in relation to the employee’s earning capacity. Notwithstanding section 85.26, subsection 2, if an employee who is eligible for compensation under this paragraph returns to work with the same employer and is compensated based only upon the employee’s functional impairment resulting from the injury as provided in this paragraph and is terminated from employment by that employer, the award or agreement for settlement for benefits under this chapter shall be reviewed upon commencement of reopening proceedings by the employee for a determination of any reduction in the employee’s earning capacity caused by the employee’s permanent partial disability.\n\nw. If it is determined that an injury has produced a disability less than that specifically described in the schedule described in paragraphs “a” through “u”, compensation shall be paid during the lesser number of weeks of disability determined, as will not exceed a total amount equal to the same percentage proportion of said scheduled maximum compensation.\n\nx. In all cases of permanent partial disability described in paragraphs “a” through “u”, or paragraph “v” when determining functional disability and not loss of earning capacity, the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment shall be determined solely by utilizing the guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American medical association, as adopted by the workers’ compensation commissioner by rule pursuant to chapter 17A. Lay testimony or agency expertise shall not be utilized in determining loss or percentage of permanent impairment pursuant to paragraphs “a” through “u”, or paragraph “v” when determining functional disability and not loss of earning capacity.\n\ny. Compensation for permanent partial disability for an injury shall terminate on the date when compensation for permanent total disability for any injury begins. An employee shall not receive compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.\n\n3. Permanent total disability.\n\na. Compensation for an injury causing permanent total disability shall be upon the basis of eighty percent per week of the employee’s average spendable weekly earnings, but not more than a weekly benefit amount, rounded to the nearest dollar, equal to two hundred percent of the statewide average weekly wage paid employees as determined by the department of workforce development under section 96.1A, subsection 35, and in effect at the time of the injury. The minimum weekly benefit amount is equal to the weekly benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly earnings are thirty-five percent of the statewide average weekly wage. The weekly compensation is payable until the employee is no longer permanently and totally disabled.\n\nb. Such compensation shall be in addition to the benefits provided in sections 85.27 and 85.28. No compensation shall be payable under this subsection for any injury for which compensation is payable under subsection 2 of this section. In the event compensation has been paid to any person under any provision of this chapter, chapter 85A, or chapter 85B for an injury producing a permanent disability, any such amounts so paid shall be deducted from the total amount of compensation payable for permanent total disability. An employee shall not receive compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.\n\nc. An employee forfeits the employee’s weekly compensation for a permanent total disability under this subsection for a week in which the employee is receiving a payment equal to or greater than fifty percent of the statewide average weekly wage from any of the following sources:\n\n(1) Gross earnings from any employer.\n\n(2) Payment for current services from any source.\n\nd. An employee is not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability under this subsection while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under chapter 96.\n\n4. Credits for excess payments. If an employee is paid weekly compensation benefits for temporary total disability under section 85.33, subsection 1, for a healing period under section 85.34, subsection 1, or for temporary partial disability under section 85.33, subsection 2, in excess of that required by chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, and chapters 85A and 85B, the excess paid by the employer shall be credited against the liability of the employer for any future weekly benefits due for an injury to that employee, provided that the employer or the employer’s representative has acted in good faith in determining and notifying an employee when the temporary total disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability benefits are terminated.\n\n5. Recovery of employee overpayment. If an employee is paid any weekly benefits in excess of that required by chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, and chapters 85A and 85B, the excess paid by the employer shall be credited against the liability of the employer for any future weekly benefits due pursuant to subsection 2, for any current or subsequent injury to the same employee.\n\n6. Professional athlete. For purposes of subsection 2, paragraph “v”, a determination of the degree of permanent disability of an individual who was injured in the course of performing as a professional athlete shall not be determined based upon employment as a professional athlete but shall be determined based upon other occupations the individual has previously performed or was reasonably suited to perform at the time of the injury.\n\n7. Successive disabilities. An employer is liable for compensating only that portion of an employee’s disability that arises out of and in the course of the employee’s employment with the employer and that relates to the injury that serves as the basis for the employee’s claim for compensation under chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, or chapter 85A or 85B. An employer is not liable for compensating an employee’s preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of employment from a prior injury with the employer, to the extent that the employee’s preexisting disability has already been compensated under chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, or chapter 85A or 85B. An employer is not liable for compensating an employee’s preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of employment with a different employer or from causes unrelated to employment.\n\n[S13, §2477-m9; C24, 27, 31, 35, 39, §1394 – 1396; C46, 50, 54, 58, §85.33 – 85.35; C62, 66, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §85.34; 82 Acts, ch 1161, §8 – 11]\n\n87 Acts, ch 111, §2, 3; 94 Acts, ch 1065, §5 – 7; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 97 Acts, ch 48, §2; 98 Acts, ch 1061, §4, 11; 98 Acts, ch 1160, §1\n\n; 2004 Acts, 1st Ex, ch 1001, §10, 11, 18\n\n; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §26; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §45; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §170; 2017 Acts, ch 23, §6 – 14, 24; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §78, 79; 2021 Acts, ch 80, §34; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1744\n\nReferred to in §85.27, 85.33, 85.59, 85.60, 85.62, 85.70, 96.7(2)(a), 96.23, 279.40\n\nSubsections 4, 5, and 7 amended",

The parties to a contested case or persons who are involved in a dispute which could culminate in a contested case may enter into a settlement of any claim arising under chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, or chapter 85A or 85B, providing for disposition of the claim. The settlement shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the workers’ compensation commissioner and submitted to the workers’ compensation commissioner for approval.\n\n2. The parties may enter into an agreement for settlement that establishes the employer’s liability, fixes the nature and extent of the employee’s current right to accrued benefits, and establishes the employee’s right to statutory benefits that accrue in the future.\n\n3. The parties may enter into a compromise settlement of the employee’s claim to benefits as a full and final disposition of the claim.\n\n4. The parties may enter into a settlement that is a combination of an agreement for settlement and a compromise settlement that establishes the employer’s liability for part of a claim but makes a full and final disposition of other parts of a claim.\n\n5. A contingent settlement may be made and approved, conditioned upon subsequent approval by a court or governmental agency, or upon any other subsequent event that is expected to occur within one year from the date of the settlement. If the subsequent approval or event does not occur, the contingent settlement and its approval may be vacated by order of the workers’ compensation commissioner upon a petition for vacation filed by one of the parties or upon agreement by all parties. If a contingent settlement is vacated, the running of any period of limitation provided for in section 85.26 is tolled from the date the settlement was initially approved until the date that the settlement is vacated, and the claim is restored to the status that the claim held when the contingent settlement was initially approved. The contingency on a settlement lapses and the settlement becomes final and fully enforceable if an action to vacate the contingent settlement or to extend the period of time allowed for the subsequent approval or event to occur is not initiated within one year from the date that the contingent settlement was initially approved.\n\n6. The parties to any settlement made pursuant to this section may agree that the employee has the right to benefits pursuant to section 85.27 under such terms and conditions as agreed to by the parties in the settlement, for a specified period of time after the settlement has been approved by the workers’ compensation commissioner. During that specified period of time, the commissioner shall have jurisdiction of the settlement for the purpose of adjudicating the employee’s entitlement to benefits provided for in section 85.27 as agreed upon in the settlement.\n\n7. The parties may agree that settlement proceeds, which are paid in a lump sum, are intended to compensate the injured worker at a given monthly or weekly rate over the life expectancy of the injured worker. If such an agreement is reached, neither the weekly compensation rate which either has been paid, or should have been paid, throughout the case, nor the maximum statutory weekly rate applicable to the injury shall apply. Instead, the rate set forth in the settlement agreement shall be the rate for the case.\n\n8. a. If an injury relating to a claim results in the injured worker needing a medically necessary permanent prosthetic device or an alteration of an existing medically necessary permanent prosthetic device, a settlement pursuant to this section must describe the medically necessary permanent prosthetic device and identify which portion of the settlement proceeds are for the purpose of covering the estimated cost of future repair or replacement of the device.\n\nb. Upon the approval of a settlement by the workers’ compensation commissioner, moneys identified for the purpose of covering the cost of future repair or replacement of a permanent prosthetic device shall be paid to the treasurer of state as the custodian of the second injury fund for administration pursuant to section 85.65, subsection 2, section 85.66, and section 85.67A.\n\nc. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, moneys identified for the purpose of covering the estimated cost of future repair or replacement of a permanent prosthetic device shall not be used to calculate an injured worker’s compensation schedule.\n\n9. a. A settlement shall be approved by the workers’ compensation commissioner if the parties show all of the following:\n\n(1) Substantial evidence exists to support the terms of the settlement.\n\n(2) Waiver of the employee’s right to a hearing, decision, and statutory benefits is made knowingly by the employee.\n\n(3) The settlement is a reasonable and informed compromise of the competing interests of the parties.\n\nb. If an employee is represented by legal counsel, it is presumed that the required showing for approval of the settlement has been made.\n\n10. Approval of a settlement by the workers’ compensation commissioner is binding on the parties and shall not be construed as an original proceeding. Notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, and chapters 85A, 85B, and 87, an approved compromise settlement shall constitute a final bar to any further rights arising under chapter 10A, subchapter III, this chapter, and chapters 85A, 85B, and 87 regarding the subject matter of the compromise and a payment made pursuant to a compromise settlement agreement shall not be construed as the payment of weekly compensation.\n\n[C75, 77, 79, 81, §85.35]\n\n83 Acts, ch 105, §4; 89 Acts, ch 60, §2; 98 Acts, ch 1061, §11; 2001 Acts, ch 87, §3; 2005 Acts, ch 168, §10, 23; 2008 Acts, ch 1032, §201; 2008 Acts, ch 1137, §1, 3; 2022 Acts, ch 1128, §3; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1745\n\nReferred to in §85.65\n\nSubsections 1 and 10 amended",

Weekly earnings means gross salary, wages, or earnings of an employee to which such employee would have been entitled had the employee worked the customary hours for the full pay period in which the employee was injured, as regularly required by the employee’s employer for the work or employment for which the employee was employed, computed or determined as follows and then rounded to the nearest dollar:\n\n1. In the case of an employee who is paid on a weekly pay period basis, the weekly gross earnings.\n\n2. In the case of an employee who is paid on a biweekly pay period basis, one-half of the biweekly gross earnings.\n\n3. In the case of an employee who is paid on a semimonthly pay period basis, the semimonthly gross earnings multiplied by twenty-four and subsequently divided by fifty-two.\n\n4. In the case of an employee who is paid on a monthly pay period basis, the monthly gross earnings multiplied by twelve and subsequently divided by fifty-two.\n\n5. In the case of an employee who is paid on a yearly pay period basis, the weekly earnings shall be the yearly earnings divided by fifty-two.\n\n6. In the case of an employee who is paid on a daily or hourly basis, or by the output of the employee, the weekly earnings shall be computed by dividing by thirteen the earnings, including shift differential pay but not including overtime or premium pay, of the employee earned in the employ of the employer in the last completed period of thirteen consecutive calendar weeks immediately preceding the injury. If the employee was absent from employment for reasons personal to the employee during part of the thirteen calendar weeks preceding the injury, the employee’s weekly earnings shall be the amount the employee would have earned had the employee worked when work was available to other employees of the employer in a similar occupation. A week which does not fairly reflect the employee’s customary earnings shall be replaced by the closest previous week with earnings that fairly represent the employee’s customary earnings.\n\n7. In the case of an employee who has been in the employ of the employer less than thirteen calendar weeks immediately preceding the injury, the employee’s weekly earnings shall be computed under subsection 6, taking the earnings, including shift differential pay but not including overtime or premium pay, for such purpose to be the amount the employee would have earned had the employee been so employed by the employer the full thirteen calendar weeks immediately preceding the injury and had worked, when work was available to other employees in a similar occupation. If the earnings of other employees cannot be determined, the employee’s weekly earnings shall be the average computed for the number of weeks the employee has been in the employ of the employer.\n\n8. If at the time of the injury the hourly earnings have not been fixed or cannot be ascertained, the earnings for the purpose of calculating compensation shall be taken to be the usual earnings for similar services where such services are rendered by paid employees.\n\n9. If an employee earns either no wages or less than the usual weekly earnings of the regular full-time adult laborer in the line of industry in which the employee is injured in that locality, the weekly earnings shall be one-fiftieth of the total earnings which the employee has earned from all employment during the twelve calendar months immediately preceding the injury.\n\na. In computing the compensation to be allowed a volunteer fire fighter, emergency medical care provider, reserve peace officer, or volunteer ambulance driver, the earnings as a fire fighter, emergency medical care provider, reserve peace officer, or volunteer ambulance driver shall be disregarded and the volunteer fire fighter, emergency medical care provider, reserve peace officer, or volunteer ambulance driver shall be paid an amount equal to the compensation the volunteer fire fighter, emergency medical care provider, reserve peace officer, or volunteer ambulance driver would be paid if injured in the normal course of the volunteer fire fighter’s, emergency medical care provider’s, reserve peace officer’s, or volunteer ambulance driver’s regular employment or an amount equal to one hundred and forty percent of the statewide average weekly wage, whichever is greater.\n\nb. If the employee was an apprentice or trainee when injured, and it is established under normal conditions the employee’s earnings should be expected to increase during the period of disability, that fact may be considered in computing the employee’s weekly earnings.\n\nc. If the employee was an inmate as defined in section 85.59, the inmate’s actual earnings shall be disregarded, and the weekly compensation rate shall be as set forth in section 85.59.\n\n10. If a wage, or method of calculating a wage, is used for the basis of the payment of a workers’ compensation insurance premium for a proprietor, partner, limited liability company member, limited liability partner, or officer of a corporation, the wage or the method of calculating the wage is determinative for purposes of computing the proprietor’s, partner’s, limited liability company member’s, limited liability partner’s, or officer’s weekly workers’ compensation benefit rate.\n\n11. In computing the compensation to be allowed an elected or appointed official, the official may choose either of the following payment options:\n\na. The official shall be paid an amount of compensation based on the official’s weekly earnings as an elected or appointed official.\n\nb. The earnings of the official as an elected or appointed official shall be disregarded and the official shall be paid an amount equal to one hundred forty percent of the statewide average weekly wage.\n\n12.

However, if the inmate is awarded benefits for an injury incurred in connection with the performance of unpaid community service under the direction of the district court, board of parole, or judicial district department of correctional services, or in connection with the provision of services pursuant to a chapter 28E agreement entered into pursuant to section 904.703, or who is performing a work assignment of value to the state or to the public under chapter 232, weekly compensation benefits under this section shall be determined and paid as in other workers’ compensation cases.\n\nc. If an inmate is receiving benefits under the provisions of this section and is recommitted to an institution covered by this section, the benefits shall immediately cease. If benefits cease because of the inmate’s recommitment, the benefits shall resume upon subsequent release from the institution.\n\nd. If death results from the injury, death benefits shall be awarded and paid to the dependents of the inmate as in other workers’ compensation cases except that the weekly rate shall be equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the state average weekly wage paid employees as determined by the department of workforce development under section 96.1A, subsection 35, and in effect at the time of the injury.\n\n4. Payment under this section shall be made promptly out of appropriations which have been made for that purpose, if any. An amount or part thereof which cannot be paid promptly from the appropriation shall be paid promptly out of moneys in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated.\n\n5. The time limit for commencing an original proceeding to determine entitlement to benefits under this section is the same as set forth in section 85.26. If an injury occurs to an inmate so as to qualify the inmate for benefits under this section, notwithstanding the fact that payments of weekly benefits are not commenced, an acknowledgment of compensability shall be filed with the workers’ compensation commissioner within thirty days of the time the responsible authority receives notice or knowledge of the injury as required by section 85.23.\n\n6. If a dispute arises as to the extent of disability when an acknowledgment of compensability is on file or when an award determining liability has been made, an action to determine the extent of disability must be commenced within one year of the time of the release of the inmate from the institution. This does not bar the right to reopen the claim as provided by section 85.26, subsection 2.\n\n7. Responsibility for the filings required by chapter 10A, subchapter III, for injuries resulting in permanent disability or death and as modified by this section shall be made in the same manner as for other employees of the institution.\n\n[C79, 81, §85.59]\n\n83 Acts, ch 101, §4; 84 Acts, ch 1280, §1; 85 Acts, ch 67, §11; 85 Acts, ch 177, §1; 87 Acts, ch 111, §5, 6; 88 Acts, ch 1165, §1; 90 Acts, ch 1251, §3; 93 Acts, ch 46, §1; 94 Acts, ch 1171, §1; 96 Acts, ch 1186, §23; 98 Acts, ch 1061, §11; 2008 Acts, ch 1079, §2; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §21; 2019 Acts, ch 24, §104; 2020 Acts, ch 1062, §81; 2023 Acts, ch 19, §1747\n\nReferred to in §85.36, 85.45, 85.61, 88.3, 232.13, 669.14, 904.809, 907.13\n\nAdditional persons deemed state employees, see §232.13\n\nSubsection 7 amended",

If the commissioner of insurance determines sufficient funds will be available, the commissioner shall not impose a surcharge on employers during the next succeeding fiscal year. If the commissioner determines sufficient funds will not be available, the commissioner shall impose by rule, pursuant to chapter 17A, a surcharge on employers during the next succeeding fiscal year for payment to the treasurer of state for the second injury fund pursuant to the requirements of this section.\n\n3.

The portion of the total aggregate assessment that is not to be collected from self-insured employers shall be collected from insured employers.\n\nd. The method of assessing self-insured employers a surcharge shall be based on paid losses.
