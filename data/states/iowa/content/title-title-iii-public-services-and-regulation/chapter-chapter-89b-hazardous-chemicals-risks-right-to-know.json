      "text": "89B.2 Legislative findings.\n\nThe general assembly finds as follows:\n\n1. The proliferation of hazardous chemicals in the environment poses a growing threat to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n\n2. The constantly increasing number and variety of hazardous chemicals and the many routes of exposure to them make it difficult and expensive to adequately monitor and detect any adverse health effects attributable to the hazardous chemicals.\n\n3. Individuals are often able to detect and thus minimize effects of exposure to hazardous chemicals if they are aware of the identity of the chemicals and the early symptoms of unsafe exposure.\n\n4. Individuals have an inherent right to know the full range of the risks they face so that they can make reasoned decisions and take informed action concerning their employment and their living conditions.\n\n5. Local fire and other government emergency response departments require detailed information about the identity, characteristics, and quantities of hazardous chemicals used and stored in communities within their jurisdictions, in order to adequately plan for, and respond to, emergencies, and enforce compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning these chemicals.\n\n6. The extent of the toxic contamination of the air, water, and land has caused a high degree of concern and much of this concern is needlessly aggravated by the unfamiliarity of the chemicals.\n\n7. There is a need to coordinate the existing regulatory and reporting responsibilities on hazardous chemical users and producers and to provide uniform access to information.\n\n84 Acts, ch 1085, §2\n\nC85, §455D.2\n\nC87, §89B.2",
