Whenever any shareholder does not have or ceases to have this qualification, the corporation shall immediately purchase all shares held by that shareholder.\n\n3. Whenever any person other than the shareholder of record becomes entitled to have shares of a corporation transferred into that person’s name or to exercise voting rights, except as a proxy, with respect to shares of the corporation, the corporation shall immediately purchase such shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this section shall be applicable whether the event occurs as a result of the appointment of a guardian or conservator for a shareholder or the shareholder’s property, transfer of shares by operation of law, involuntary transfer of shares, judicial proceedings, execution, levy, bankruptcy proceedings, receivership proceedings, foreclosure or enforcement of a pledge or encumbrance, or any other situation or occurrence. However, this section does not apply to any voluntary transfer of shares as defined in this chapter.\n\n4.

The shareholder and the shareholder’s executors, administrators, legal representatives, or successors in interest shall promptly do all things which may be necessary or convenient to cause transfer to be made as of the transfer date. However, the shares shall promptly be transferred on the stock transfer books of the corporation as of the transfer date, notwithstanding any delay in transferring or surrendering the shares or certificates representing the shares, and the transfer shall be valid and effective for all purposes as of the close of business on the transfer date. The purchase price for such shares shall be paid as provided in this chapter, but the transfer of shares to the corporation as provided in this section shall not be delayed or affected by any delay or default in making payment.\n\n5. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 4, purchase by the corporation is not required upon the occurrence of any event other than death of a shareholder if the corporation is dissolved or voluntarily elects to adopt the provisions of the Iowa business corporation Act, as provided in section 490.1801, subsection 2, within sixty days after the occurrence of the event. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide that purchase is not required upon the death of a shareholder if the corporation is dissolved within sixty days after the death. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 4, purchase by the corporation is not required upon the death of a shareholder if the corporation voluntarily elects to adopt the provisions of the Iowa business corporation Act, as provided in section 490.1801, subsection 2, within sixty days after death.\n\n6. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or in an agreement among all shareholders of the professional corporation:\n\na. The purchase price for shares shall be their book value as of the end of the month immediately preceding the death or other event which requires purchase. Book value shall be determined from the books and records of the professional corporation in accordance with the regular method of accounting used by the corporation, uniformly and consistently applied. Adjustments to book value shall be made, if necessary, to take into account work in process and accounts receivable. Any final determination of book value made in good faith by any independent certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants employed by the corporation for the purpose shall be conclusive on all persons.\n\nb. The purchase price shall be paid in cash as follows:\n\n(1) Upon the death of a shareholder, thirty percent of the purchase price shall be paid within ninety days after death, and the balance shall be paid in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the death.\n\n(2) Upon the happening of any other event referred to in this section, one-tenth of the purchase price shall be paid within ninety days after the date of such event, and the balance shall be paid in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of the event.\n\nc. Interest from the date of death or other event shall be payable annually on principal payment dates, at the rate of six percent per annum on the unpaid balance of the purchase price.\n\nd. All persons who are shareholders of the professional corporation on the date of death or other event, and their executors, administrators, and legal representatives, shall, to the extent the corporation fails to meet its obligations under this section, be jointly liable for the payment of the purchase price and interest in proportion to their percentage of ownership of the corporation’s shares, disregarding shares of the deceased or withdrawing shareholder.\n\ne. The part of the purchase price remaining unpaid after the initial payment shall be evidenced by a negotiable promissory note, which shall be executed by the corporation and all shareholders liable for payment. Any person liable on the note shall have the right to prepay the note in full or in part at any time.\n\nf. If the person making any payment is not reasonably able to determine which of two or more persons is entitled to receive a payment, or if the payment is payable to a person who is unknown, or who is under disability and there is no person legally competent to receive the payment, or who cannot be found after the exercise of reasonable diligence by the person making the payment, it shall be deposited with the treasurer of state and shall be subject to the provisions of the Iowa business corporation Act, chapter 490, with respect to funds deposited with the treasurer of state upon the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of a corporation.\n\ng. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no part of the purchase price shall be required to be paid until the certificates representing such shares have been surrendered to the corporation.\n\nh. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, payment of any part of the purchase price for shares of a deceased shareholder shall not be required until the executor or administrator of the deceased shareholder provides any indemnity, release, or other document from any taxing authority, which is reasonably necessary to protect the corporation against liability for estate, inheritance, and death taxes.\n\n7. The articles of incorporation or bylaws or an agreement among all shareholders of a professional corporation may provide for a different purchase price, a different method of determining the purchase price, a different interest rate or no interest, and other terms, conditions, and schedules of payment.\n\n8. The articles of incorporation or bylaws or an agreement among all shareholders of a professional corporation may provide for the optional or mandatory purchase of its own shares by the corporation in other situations, subject to any applicable law regarding such purchase.\n\n[C71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, §496C.14]\n\n2001 Acts, ch 24, §62; 2003 Acts, ch 66, §8; 2009 Acts, ch 133, §165; 2021 Acts, ch 165, §222, 230; 2022 Acts, ch 1021, §147",
