Title to commodities or products. If a sale is contracted to the cooperative, the sale shall transfer title to the commodity or product absolutely, except for a recorded lien or security interest against the agricultural commodity or product of the patron member or patron as provided in article 9 of chapter 554, and provisions in Title XIV, subtitle 3, governing agricultural liens, and liens granted against farm products under federal law, to the cooperative on delivery of the commodity or product or at another specified time if expressly provided in the contract. The contract may allow the cooperative to sell or resell the commodity or product of its patron member or patron with or without taking title to the commodity or product, and pay the resale price to the patron member or patron, after deducting all necessary selling, overhead, and other costs and expenses, including other proper reserves and interest.\n\n3. Term of contract. A single term of a marketing contract shall not exceed ten years, but a marketing contract may be made self-renewing for periods not exceeding five years each, subject to the right of either party to terminate by giving written notice of the termination during a period of the current term as specified in the contract.\n\n4. Damages for breach of contract. The cooperative’s bylaws or marketing contract in which the cooperative is a party may set a specific sum as liquidated damages to be paid by the patron member or patron to the cooperative for breach of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of a commodity or product and may provide that the patron member or patron shall pay the costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees if an action is brought on the contract by the cooperative. The remedies for breach of contract are valid and enforceable in the courts of this state. The provisions shall be enforced as liquidated damages and are not considered a penalty.\n\n5. Injunction against breach of contract. If there is a breach or threatened breach of a marketing contract by a patron member or patron, the cooperative is entitled to an injunction to prevent the further breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance of the contract. Pending the adjudication of the action after filing a complaint showing the breach or threatened breach and filing a sufficient bond, the cooperative is entitled to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the patron member or patron.\n\n6. Penalties for contract interference. A person who knowingly induces or attempts to induce any patron member or patron of a cooperative organized under this chapter to breach a marketing contract with the cooperative is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.\n\n7. Civil damages for contract interference. In addition to the penalty provided in subsection 6, the person may be liable to the cooperative for civil damages for any violation of that subsection.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §34; 2006 Acts, ch 1030, §54",

A director may waive notice of a meeting of the board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and does not participate in the meeting after the objection.\n\n6.

Committees may include a special litigation committee consisting of one or more independent directors or other independent persons to consider legal rights or remedies of the cooperative and whether those rights and remedies should be pursued. Committees other than special litigation committees are subject at all times to the direction and control of the board.\n\n2. Membership. Committee members must be natural persons. Unless the articles or bylaws provide for a different membership or manner of appointment, a committee consists of one or more persons, who need not be directors, appointed by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present.\n\n3. Procedure. The procedures for meetings of the board apply to committees and members of committees to the same extent as those sections apply to the board and individual directors.\n\n4. Minutes. Minutes, if any, of committee meetings must be made available upon request to members of the committee and to any director.\n\n5. Standard of conduct. The establishment of, delegation of authority to, and action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a director with the standard of conduct set forth in section 501A.712.\n\n6. Committee members considered directors. Committee members are considered to be directors for purposes of sections 501A.712, 501A.713, and 501A.715.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §45",

A director shall discharge the duties of the position of director in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the cooperative, and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. A person who so performs those duties is not liable by reason of being or having been a director of the cooperative.\n\n2. Reliance.\n\na. A director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by any of the following:\n\n(1) One or more officers or employees of the cooperative whom the director reasonably believes to be liable and competent in the matters presented.\n\n(2) Counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters that the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence.\n\n(3) A committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, duly established by the board, as to matters within its designated authority, if the director reasonably believes the committee to merit confidence.\n\nb. Paragraph “a” does not apply to a director who has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes the reliance otherwise permitted by paragraph “a” unwarranted.\n\n3. Presumption of assent and dissent. A director who is present at a meeting of the board when an action is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present is presumed to have assented to the action approved, unless any of the following applies:\n\na. The director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and does not participate in the meeting after the objection, in which case the director is not considered to be present at the meeting for any purpose of this chapter.\n\nb. The director votes against the action at the meeting.\n\nc. The director is prohibited by a conflict of interest from voting on the action.\n\n4. Considerations. In discharging the duties of the position of director, a director may, in considering the best interests of the cooperative, consider the interests of the cooperative’s employees, customers, suppliers, and creditors, the economy of the state, and long-term as well as short-term interests of the cooperative and its patron members, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the cooperative.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §46\n\nReferred to in §501A.711",

A contract or other transaction between a cooperative and one or more of its directors, or between a cooperative and a business entity in or of which one or more of its directors are governors, directors, managers, officers, or legal representatives or have a material financial interest, is not void or voidable because the director or directors or the other business entities are parties or because the director or directors are present at the meeting of the members or the board or a committee at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified, if any of the following applies:\n\n(1) The contract or transaction was, and the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of establishing that the contract or transaction was, fair and reasonable as to the cooperative at the time it was authorized, approved, or ratified and all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The material facts as to the contract or transaction and as to the director’s or directors’ interest are disclosed or known to the members.\n\n(b) The material facts as to the contract or transaction and as to the director’s or directors’ interest are fully disclosed or known to the board or a committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a majority of the board or committee, but the interested director or directors are not counted in determining the presence of a quorum and must not vote.\n\n(2) The contract or transaction is a distribution, contract, or transaction that is made available to all members or patron members as part of the cooperative’s business.\n\nb. If a committee is elected or appointed to authorize, ratify, or approve a contract or transaction under this section, the members of the committee must not have a conflict of interest and must be charged with representing the best interests of the cooperative.\n\n2. Material financial interest. For purposes of this section, all of the following apply:\n\na. A resolution fixing the compensation of a director or fixing the compensation of another director as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the cooperative is not void or voidable or considered to be a contract or other transaction between a cooperative and one or more of its directors for purposes of this section even though the director receiving the compensation fixed by the resolution is present and voting at the meeting of the board or a committee at which the resolution is authorized, approved, or ratified or even though other directors voting upon the resolution are also receiving compensation from the cooperative.\n\nb. A director has a material financial interest in each organization in which the director or a family member of the director has a material financial interest. A contract or other transaction between a cooperative and a family member of a director is considered to be a transaction between the cooperative and the director. A family member of a director includes the spouse, parents, children and spouses of children, brothers and sisters and spouses of brothers and sisters, and the brothers and sisters of the spouse of the director or any combination of them.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §47\n\nReferred to in §501A.711",

As used in this section, all of the following apply:\n\na. “Official capacity” means any of the following:\n\n(1) With respect to a director, the position of director in a cooperative.\n\n(2) With respect to a person other than a director, the elective or appointive office or position held by the person, member of a committee of the board, the employment relationship undertaken by an employee of the cooperative, or the scope of the services provided by members of the cooperative who provide services to the cooperative.\n\n(3) With respect to a director, chief executive officer, member, or employee of the cooperative who, while a director, chief executive officer, or member or employee of the cooperative, is or was serving at the request of the cooperative or whose duties in that position involve or involved service as a governor, director, manager, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another organization or employee benefit plan, the position of that person as a governor, director, manager, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, or agent, as the case may be, of the other organization or employee benefit plan.\n\nb. “Predecessor entity” includes a domestic cooperative or foreign cooperative that was the predecessor of the cooperative referred to in this section in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor entity’s existence ceased upon consummation of the transaction.\n\nc. “Proceeding” means a threatened, pending, or completed civil, criminal, administrative, arbitration, or investigative proceeding, including a proceeding by or in the right of the cooperative.\n\nd. “Special legal counsel” means counsel who has not represented the cooperative or a related organization, or a director, manager, member of a committee of the board, or employee whose indemnification is in issue.\n\n2. Indemnification.\n\na. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4, a cooperative shall indemnify a person made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of the former or present official capacity of the person against judgments, penalties, and fines, including, without limitation, excise taxes assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan, settlements, and reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding, if, with respect to the acts or omissions of the person complained of in the proceeding, any of the following applies:\n\n(1) All of the following apply:\n\n(a) The person has not been indemnified by another organization or employee benefit plan for the same judgments, penalties, fines, including, without limitation, excise taxes assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan, settlements, and reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding with respect to the same acts or omissions.\n\n(b) The person acted in good faith.\n\n(c) The person has not received an improper personal benefit.\n\n(d) The person has not committed an act for which liability can be eliminated or limited under section 501A.714.\n\n(e) In the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.\n\n(2) (a) In the case of an act or omission occurring in the official capacity described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1) or (2), the person reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interests of the cooperative.\n\n(b) In the case of an act or omission occurring in the official capacity described in subsection 1, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3), the person reasonably believed that the conduct was not opposed to the best interests of the cooperative. If the person’s acts or omissions complained of in the proceeding relate to conduct as a director, officer, trustee, employee, or agent of an employee benefit plan, the conduct is not considered to be opposed to the best interests of the cooperative if the person reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interests of the participants or beneficiaries of the employee benefit plan.\n\nb. The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent does not, of itself, establish that the person did not meet the criteria set forth in this subsection.\n\n3. Advances.\n\na. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4, if a person is made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding, the person is entitled, upon written request to the cooperative, to payment or reimbursement by the cooperative of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding, as follows:\n\n(1) Upon receipt by the cooperative of a written affirmation by the person of a good-faith belief that the criteria for indemnification set forth in subsection 2 have been satisfied, and a written undertaking by the person to repay all amounts paid or reimbursed by the cooperative, if it is ultimately determined that the criteria for indemnification have not been satisfied.\n\n(2) After a determination that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this section.\n\nb. The written undertaking required by this subsection is an unlimited general obligation of the person making it, but need not be secured and shall be accepted without reference to financial ability to make the repayment.\n\n4. Prohibition or limit on indemnification or advances. The articles or bylaws either may prohibit indemnification or advances of expenses otherwise required by this section or may impose conditions on indemnification or advances of expenses in addition to the conditions contained in subsection 2 or 3, including, without limitation, monetary limits on indemnification or advances of expenses if the conditions apply equally to all persons or to all persons within a given class. A prohibition or limit on indemnification or advances of expenses shall not apply to or affect the right of a person to indemnification or advances of expenses with respect to any acts or omissions of the person occurring before the effective date of a provision in the articles or the date of adoption of a provision in the bylaws establishing the prohibition or limit on indemnification or advances of expenses.\n\n5. Reimbursement to witnesses. This section does not require, or limit the ability of, a cooperative to reimburse expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by a person in connection with an appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the person has not been made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding.\n\n6. Determination of eligibility.\n\na. All determinations whether indemnification of a person is required because the criteria set forth in subsection 2 have been satisfied and whether a person is entitled to payment or reimbursement of expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding as provided in subsection 3 must be made as follows:\n\n(1) By the board by a majority of a quorum, if the directors who are, at the time, parties to the proceeding are not counted for determining either a majority or the presence of a quorum.\n\n(2) If a quorum under subparagraph (1) cannot be obtained, by a majority of a committee of the board consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding duly designated to act in the matter by a majority of the full board, including directors who are parties.\n\n(3) If a determination is not made under subparagraph (1) or (2), by special legal counsel selected either by a majority of the board or a committee by vote under subparagraph (1) or (2), or if the requisite quorum of the full board cannot be obtained and the committee cannot be established, by a majority of the full board, including directors who are parties.\n\n(4) If a determination is not made under subparagraphs (1) through (3), by the affirmative vote of the members, but the membership interests held by parties to the proceeding must not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum and are not considered to be present and entitled to vote on the determination.\n\n(5) If an adverse determination is made under subparagraphs (1) through (4) or paragraph “b” or if a determination is not made under subparagraphs (1) through (4) or paragraph “b” within sixty days either after the later to occur of the termination of a proceeding or a written request for indemnification to the cooperative, or a written request for an advance of expenses, as the case may be, by a court in this state, which may be the same court in which the proceeding involving the person’s liability took place upon application of the person and any notice the court requires. The person seeking indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses under this subparagraph has the burden of establishing that the person is entitled to indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses.\n\nb. With respect to a person who is not, and was not at the time of the act or omission complained of in the proceedings, a director, chief executive officer, or person possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of the cooperative, the determination whether indemnification of this person is required because the criteria set forth in subsection 2 have been satisfied and whether such person is entitled to payment or reimbursement of expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding as provided in subsection 3 may be made by an annually appointed committee of the board, having at least one member who is a director. The committee shall report at least annually to the board concerning its actions.\n\n7. Insurance. A cooperative may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person in that person’s official capacity against any liability asserted against and incurred by the person in or arising from that capacity, whether or not the cooperative would have been required to indemnify the person against the liability under the provisions of this section.\n\n8. Disclosure. A cooperative that indemnifies or advances expenses to a person in accordance with this section in connection with a proceeding by or on behalf of the cooperative shall report to the members in writing the amount of the indemnification or advance and to whom and on whose behalf it was paid not later than the next meeting of members.\n\n9. Indemnification of other persons. Nothing in this section must be construed to limit the power of the cooperative to indemnify persons other than a director, chief executive officer, member, employee, or member of a committee of the board of the cooperative by contract or otherwise.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §49; 2006 Acts, ch 1010, §130; 2006 Acts, ch 1030, §56, 85, 89; 2012 Acts, ch 1023, §99, 157\n\nReferred to in §501A.711",

A member’s agent or attorney has the same inspection and copying rights as the member. The right to copy records under this subsection includes, if reasonable, the right to receive copies made by photographic copying, xerographic copying, or other means.

To the extent authorized in the articles, a member control agreement, the bylaws, or a board resolution, and determined by the board, a regular or special meeting of members may be held solely by any combination of means of remote communication through which the members may participate in the meeting, if notice of the meeting is given to every owner of membership interests entitled to vote as would be required by this chapter for a meeting, and if the membership interests held by the members participating in the meeting would be sufficient to constitute a quorum at a meeting. Participation by a member by that means constitutes presence at the meeting in person or by proxy if all the other requirements of this chapter for the meeting are met.\n\n3.

Notice to members.\n\na. Any notice to members given by the cooperative under any provision of this chapter, the articles, or the bylaws by a form of electronic communication consented to by the member to whom the notice is given is effective when given.

The cooperative is entitled to rely on any consent so given until revoked by the member, provided that no revocation affects the validity of any notice given before receipt by the cooperative of revocation of the consent.\n\n6. Revocation.

A patron member of a cooperative is only entitled to one vote on an issue to be voted upon by members holding patron membership interests. However, if authorized in the cooperative’s articles or bylaws, a patron member may be entitled to additional votes based on patronage criteria in section 501A.811. If nonpatron members are authorized by the patron members and granted voting rights on any matter voted on by the members of the cooperative, the entire patron members’ voting power shall be voted collectively based upon the vote of the majority of patron members voting on the issue and the collective vote of the patron members shall be a majority of the vote cast unless otherwise provided in the bylaws. The bylaws shall not reduce the collective patron member vote to less than fifteen percent of the total vote on matters of the cooperative. A nonpatron member has the voting rights in accordance to the nonpatron member’s nonpatron membership interests as granted in the bylaws, subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n2. Right to vote at meeting. A member or delegate may exercise voting rights on any matter that is before the members as prescribed in the articles or bylaws at a members’ meeting from the time the member or delegate arrives at the members’ meeting, unless the articles or bylaws specify an earlier and specific time for closing the right to vote.\n\n3. Voting method. A member’s vote at a members’ meeting shall be cast in person, by mail if a mail ballot is authorized by the board, or by an alternative voting method if that is authorized by the board. A vote shall not be cast by proxy, except as provided in subsection 4. The cooperative shall take reasonable measures to authenticate that a vote is cast by a member eligible to cast that vote.\n\n4. Members represented by delegates.\n\na. The provisions of this subsection apply to members represented by delegates.\n\nb. A cooperative may provide in the articles or bylaws that units or districts of members are entitled to be represented at members’ meetings by delegates chosen by the members of the unit or district. The delegates may vote on matters at the members’ meeting in the same manner as a member. The delegates may only exercise the voting rights on a basis and with the number of votes as prescribed in the articles or bylaws.\n\nc. If the approval of a certain portion of the members is required for adoption of amendments, a dissolution, a merger, a consolidation, or a sale of assets, the votes of delegates shall be counted as votes by the members represented by the delegate.\n\nd. Patron members may be represented by the proxy of other patron members.\n\ne. Nonpatron members may be represented by proxy if authorized in the bylaws.\n\n5. Mail ballots. The provisions of this subsection apply to mail ballots.\n\na. A member who is or will be absent from a members’ meeting may vote by mail on any motion, resolution, or amendment that the board submits for vote by mail.\n\nb.

The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the member. If it is reasonably concluded that the telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication is valid, the inspectors of election or, if there are not inspectors, the other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied to make that determination. A proxy so appointed may vote on behalf of the member, or otherwise participate, in a meeting by remote communication under section 501A.807, to the extent the member appointing the proxy would have been entitled to participate by remote communication if the member did not appoint the proxy.\n\nd. A copy, facsimile, telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original writing or transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any purpose for which the original transmission could be used, if the copy, facsimile, telecommunication, or other reproduction is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.\n\ne. An appointment of a proxy for membership interests owned jointly by two or more members is valid if signed or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by any one of them, unless the cooperative receives from any one of those members written notice or an authenticated electronic communication either denying the authority of that person to appoint a proxy or appointing a different proxy.\n\n2. Duration. The appointment of a proxy is valid for eleven months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment. An appointment is not irrevocable unless the appointment is coupled with an interest in the membership interests or the cooperative.\n\n3. Termination. An appointment may be terminated at will unless the appointment is coupled with an interest, in which case the appointment shall not be terminated except in accordance with the terms of an agreement, if any, between the parties to the appointment. Termination may be made by filing written notice of the termination of the appointment with a manager of the cooperative or by filing a new written appointment of a proxy with a manager of the cooperative. Termination in either manner revokes all prior proxy appointments and is effective when filed with a manager of the cooperative.\n\n4. Revocation by death or incapacity. The death or incapacity of a person appointing a proxy does not revoke the authority of the proxy, unless written notice of the death or incapacity is received by a manager of the cooperative before the proxy exercises the authority under that appointment.\n\n5. Multiple proxies. Unless the appointment specifically provides otherwise, if two or more persons are appointed as proxies for a member, all of the following apply:\n\na. Any one of them may vote the membership interests on each item of business in accordance with specific instructions contained in the appointment.\n\nb. If no specific instructions are contained in the appointment with respect to voting the membership interests on a particular item of business, the membership interests must be voted as a majority of the proxies determine. If the proxies are equally divided, the membership interests must not be voted.\n\n6. Vote of proxy accepted and liability. Unless the appointment of a proxy contains a restriction, limitation, or specific reservation of authority, the cooperative may accept a vote or action taken by a person named in the appointment. The vote of a proxy is final, binding, and not subject to challenge, but the proxy is liable to the member for damages resulting from a failure to exercise the proxy or from an exercise of the proxy in violation of the authority granted in the appointment.\n\n7. Limited authority. If a proxy is given authority by a member to vote on less than all items of business considered at a meeting of members, the member is considered to be present and entitled to vote by the proxy only with respect to those items of business for which the proxy has authority to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a member who abstains with respect to an item of business is considered to have authority to vote on the item of business for purposes of this subsection.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §64",

If nonpatron interests are authorized, the patron membership interests collectively shall have not less than fifty percent of the cooperative’s financial rights to profit allocations and distributions. However, the cooperative’s articles or bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of patron members to allow the cooperative’s financial rights to profit allocations and distributions to patron members collectively to be a lesser amount but in no case less than fifteen percent.\n\n2. Nonpatron membership interests.\n\na. In order for a cooperative to have nonpatron membership interests, the patron members must approve articles or bylaw provisions authorizing the terms and conditions of the nonpatron membership interests, which may include authorizing the board to determine the terms and conditions of the nonpatron membership interests.\n\nb. If nonpatron membership interests are authorized, the cooperative may solicit and issue nonpatron membership interests on terms and conditions determined by the board and disclosed in the articles, bylaws, or by separate disclosure to the members. Each member acquiring nonpatron membership interests shall sign a member control agreement or otherwise agree to the conditions of the bylaws. The control agreement or the bylaws shall describe the rights and obligations of the member as it relates to the nonpatron membership interests, the financial and governance rights, the transferability of the nonpatron membership interests, the division and allocation of profits and losses among the membership interests and membership classes, and financial rights upon liquidation. If the articles or bylaws do not otherwise provide for the allocation of the profits and losses between patron membership interests and nonpatron membership interests, then the allocation of profits and losses among nonpatron membership interests individually and patron membership interests collectively shall be allocated on the basis of the value of contributions to capital made according to the patron membership interests collectively and the nonpatron membership interests individually to the extent the contributions have been accepted by the cooperative. Distributions of cash or other assets of the cooperative shall be allocated among the membership interests as provided in the articles or bylaws, subject to the provisions of this chapter. If not otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, distributions shall be made on the basis of value of the capital contributions of the patron membership interests collectively and the nonpatron membership interests to the extent the contributions have been accepted by the cooperative.\n\n3. Amounts and divisions of membership interests. The authorized amount and divisions of patron membership interests and, if authorized by the patron members, nonpatron membership interests, may be increased, decreased, established, or altered in accordance with the restrictions in this chapter by amending the articles or bylaws at a regular members’ meeting or at a special members’ meeting called for the purpose of the amendment.\n\n4. Issuance of membership interests. Authorized membership interests may be issued on terms and conditions prescribed in the articles, bylaws, or if authorized in the articles or bylaws as determined by the board. The cooperative shall disclose to any person acquiring membership interests to be issued by the cooperative, the organization, capital structure, and known business prospects and risks of the cooperative, the nature of the governance and financial rights of the membership interest being acquired and of other classes of membership and membership interests. The cooperative shall notify all members of the membership interests being issued by the cooperative. A membership interest shall not be issued until subscription price of the membership interest has been paid for in money or property with the value of the property to be contributed approved by the board.\n\n5. Transferring or selling membership interests. After issuance by the cooperative, membership interests in a cooperative may only be sold or transferred with the approval of the board. The board may adopt resolutions prescribing procedures to prospectively approve transfers.\n\n6. Cooperative first right to purchase membership interests. The articles or bylaws may provide that the cooperative or the patron members, individually or collectively, have the first privilege of purchasing the membership interests of any class of membership interests offered for sale. The first privilege to purchase membership interests may be satisfied by notice to other members that the membership interests are for sale and a procedure by which members may proceed to attempt to purchase and acquire the membership interests.\n\n7. Payment for dissenting membership interests.\n\na. Subject to the provisions in the articles and bylaws, a member may dissent from and obtain payment for the fair value of the member’s membership interests in the cooperative if all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The majority of the cooperative’s member voting power is held by different classes of interests.\n\n(2) The articles or bylaws are amended or the cooperative is merged or otherwise combined with another entity in a manner that materially and adversely affects the rights and preferences of the membership interests of the dissenting member.\n\nb. The dissenting member shall file a notice of intent to demand fair value of the membership interest with the records officer of the cooperative within thirty days after the amendment of the bylaws and notice of the amendment to members; otherwise, the right of the dissenting member to demand payment of fair value for the membership interest is waived. If a proposed amendment of the articles or bylaws must be approved by the members, a member who is entitled to dissent and who wishes to exercise dissenter’s rights shall file a notice to demand fair value of the membership interest with the records officer of the cooperative; otherwise, the right to demand fair value for the membership interest by the dissenting member is waived. After receipt of the dissenting member’s demand notice and approval of the amendment, the cooperative has sixty days to rescind the amendment, or otherwise the cooperative shall remit the fair value for the member’s interest to the dissenting member by one hundred eighty days after receipt of the notice. Upon receipt of the fair value for the membership interest, the member has no further member rights in the cooperative.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §67\n\nReferred to in §501A.1007",

Except as provided in subsection 3, a member’s financial rights are transferable in whole or in part.\n\n2. Effect of assignment of financial rights. An assignment of a member’s financial rights entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the share of profits and losses and the distributions to which the assignor would otherwise be entitled. An assignment of a member’s financial rights does not dissolve the cooperative and does not entitle or empower the assignee to become a member, to exercise any governance rights, to receive any notices from the cooperative, or to cause dissolution. The assignment shall not allow the assignee to control the member’s exercise of governance or voting rights.\n\n3. Restrictions of assignment of financial rights.\n\na. A restriction on the assignment of financial rights may be imposed in the articles, in the bylaws, in a member control agreement, by a resolution adopted by the members, by an agreement among or other written action by the members, or by an agreement among or other written action by the members and the cooperative. A restriction is not binding with respect to financial rights reflected in the required records before the adoption of the restriction, unless the owners of those financial rights are parties to the agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.\n\nb. Subject to paragraph “c”, a written restriction on the assignment of financial rights that is not manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances and is noted conspicuously in the required records may be enforced against the owner of the restricted financial rights or a successor or transferee of the owner, including a pledgee or a legal representative. Unless noted conspicuously in the required records, a restriction, even though permitted by this section, is ineffective against a person without knowledge of the restriction.\n\nc. With regard to restrictions on the assignment of financial rights, a would-be assignee of financial rights is entitled to rely on a statement of membership interest issued by the cooperative under section 501A.903. A restriction on the assignment of financial rights, which is otherwise valid and in effect at the time of the issuance of a statement of membership interest but which is not reflected in that statement, is ineffective against an assignee who takes an assignment in reliance on the statement.\n\nd. Notwithstanding any provision of law, articles, bylaws, member control agreement, other agreement, resolution, or action to the contrary, a security interest in a member’s financial rights may be foreclosed and otherwise enforced, and a secured party may assign a member’s financial rights in accordance with the uniform commercial code, chapter 554, without the consent or approval of the member whose financial rights are subject to the security interest.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §68\n\nReferred to in §501A.903",

      "text": "501A.903 Nature of a membership interest and statement of interest owned.\n\n1. Generally. A membership interest is personal property. A member has no interest in specific cooperative property. All property of the cooperative is property of the cooperative.\n\n2. Statement of membership interest. At the request of any member, the cooperative shall state in writing the particular membership interest owned by that member as of the date the cooperative makes the statement. The statement must describe the member’s rights to vote, if any, to share in profits and losses, and to share in distributions, restrictions on assignments of financial rights under section 501A.902, subsection 3, or voting rights under section 501A.810 then in effect, as well as any assignment of the member’s rights then in effect other than a security interest.\n\n3. Terms of membership interests. All the membership interests of a cooperative are subject to all of the following:\n\na. Membership interests shall be of one class, without series, unless the articles or bylaws establish or authorize the board to establish more than one class or series within classes.\n\nb. Ordinary patron membership interests and, if authorized, nonpatron membership interests subject to this chapter are entitled to vote as provided in section 501A.810, and have equal rights and preferences in all matters not otherwise provided for by the board and to the extent that the articles or bylaws have fixed the relative rights and preferences of different classes and series.\n\nc. Membership interests share profits and losses and are entitled to distributions as provided in sections 501A.1005 and 501A.1006.\n\n4. Rights of judgment creditor. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member, the court may charge a member’s or an assignee’s financial rights with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of a member’s financial rights under section 501A.902. This chapter does not deprive any member or assignee of financial rights of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the membership interest. This section is the sole and exclusive remedy of a judgment creditor with respect to the judgment debtor’s membership interest.\n\n5. Establishment of class or series.\n\na. Subject to any restrictions in the articles or bylaws, the power granted in this subsection may be exercised by a resolution or resolutions establishing a class or series, setting forth the designation of the class or series, and fixing the relative rights and preferences of the class or series. Any of the rights and preferences of a class or series established in the articles, bylaws, or by resolution of the board may do any of the following:\n\n(1) Be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the articles or bylaws or outside the resolution or resolutions establishing the class or series, if the manner in which the facts operate upon the rights and preferences of the class or series is clearly and expressly set forth in the articles or bylaws or in the resolution or resolutions establishing the class or series.\n\n(2) Include by reference some or all of the terms of any agreements, contracts, or other arrangements entered into by the cooperative in connection with the establishment of the class or series if the cooperative retains at its principal executive office a copy of the agreements, contracts, or other arrangements or the portions will be included by reference.\n\nb. A statement setting forth the name of the cooperative and the text of the resolution and certifying the adoption of the resolution and the date of adoption must be given to the members before the acceptance of any contributions for which the resolution creates rights or preferences not set forth in the articles or bylaws. Where the members have received notice of the creation of membership interests with rights or preferences not set forth in the articles or bylaws before the acceptance of the contributions with respect to the membership interests, the statement may be filed anytime within one year after the acceptance of the contributions. The resolution is effective three days after delivery to the members is deemed effective by the board, or, if the statement is not required to be given to the members before the acceptance of contributions, on the date of its adoption by the directors.\n\n6. Specific terms. Without limiting the authority granted in this section, in regulating the membership interests of a class or series, a cooperative may do any of the following:\n\na. Subject to the right of the cooperative, redeem any of those membership interests at the price fixed for their redemption by the articles or bylaws or by the board.\n\nb. Entitle the members to receive cumulative, partially cumulative, or noncumulative distributions.\n\nc. Provide a preference over any class or series of membership interests for the payment of distributions of any or all kinds.\n\nd. Convert membership interests into any other class or any series of the same or another class.\n\ne. Provide full, partial, or no voting rights, except as provided in section 501A.810.\n\n7. Grant of a security interest. For the purpose of any law relating to security interests, membership interests, governance or voting rights, and financial rights are each to be characterized as provided in section 554.8103, subsection 3.\n\n8. Powers of estate of a deceased or incompetent member.\n\na. If a member who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges the member to be incompetent to manage the member’s person or property, or an order for relief under the bankruptcy code is entered with respect to the member, the member’s executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, trustee, or other legal representative may exercise all of the member’s rights for the purpose of settling the estate or administering the member’s property. If a member is a business entity, trust, or other entity and is dissolved, terminated, or placed by a court in receivership or bankruptcy, the powers of that member may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.\n\nb. If an event referred to in paragraph “a” causes the termination of a member’s membership interest and the termination does not result in dissolution, then, subject to the articles and bylaws, all of the following apply:\n\n(1) As provided in section 501A.902, the terminated member’s interest will be considered to be merely that of an assignee of the financial rights owned before the termination of membership.\n\n(2) The rights to be exercised by the legal representative of the terminated member shall be limited accordingly.\n\n9. Liability of subscribers and members with respect to membership interests. A person who subscribes to or owns a membership interest in a cooperative is under no obligation to the cooperative or its creditors with respect to the membership interests subscribed for or owned, except to pay to the cooperative the full consideration for which the membership interests are issued or to be issued.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §69; 2006 Acts, ch 1030, §58\n\nReferred to in §501A.902",

A court may grant equitable relief that the court deems just and reasonable in the circumstances or may dissolve a cooperative and liquidate its assets and business as follows:\n\na. In a supervised voluntary dissolution that is applied for by the cooperative.\n\nb. In an action by a member when it is established that any of the following apply:\n\n(1) The directors or the persons having the authority otherwise vested in the board are deadlocked in the management of the cooperative’s affairs and the members are unable to break the deadlock.\n\n(2) The directors or those in control of the cooperative have acted fraudulently, illegally, or in a manner unfairly prejudicial toward one or more members in their capacities as members, directors, or officers.\n\n(3) The members of the cooperative are so divided in voting power that, for a period that includes the time when two consecutive regular members’ meetings were held, they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon the election and qualification of their successors.\n\n(4) The cooperative assets are being misapplied or wasted.\n\n(5) The period of duration as provided in the articles has expired and has not been extended as provided in this chapter.\n\nc. In an action by a creditor when any of the following applies:\n\n(1) The claim of the creditor against the cooperative has been reduced to judgment and an execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied.\n\n(2) The cooperative has admitted in writing that the claim of the creditor against the cooperative is due and owing and it is established that the cooperative is unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business.\n\n(3) In an action by the attorney general to dissolve the cooperative in accordance with this chapter when it is established that a decree of dissolution is appropriate.\n\n2. Condition of cooperative or association. In determining whether to order equitable relief or dissolution, the court shall take into consideration the financial condition of the cooperative, but shall not refuse to order equitable relief or dissolution solely on the grounds that the cooperative has accumulated operating net income or current operating net income.\n\n3. Dissolution as remedy. In deciding whether to order dissolution of the cooperative, the court shall consider whether lesser relief suggested by one or more parties, such as a form of equitable relief or a partial liquidation, would be adequate to permanently relieve the circumstances established under subsection 1, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (1) or (2). Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n4. Expenses. If the court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or otherwise not in good faith, the court may in its discretion award reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements, to any of the other parties.\n\n5. Venue. Proceedings under this section shall be brought in a court within the county where the registered address of the cooperative is located.\n\n6. Parties. It is not necessary to make members parties to the action or proceeding unless relief is sought against them personally.\n\n2005 Acts, ch 135, §91",
