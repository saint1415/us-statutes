By the corporation, directly, derivatively, or through a receiver, trustee, or other legal representative, against an incumbent or former director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation.\n\nc. By the attorney general under section 490.1430.\n\n3. In a shareholder’s proceeding under subsection 2, paragraph “a”, to enjoin an unauthorized corporate act, the court may enjoin or set aside the act, if equitable and if all affected persons are parties to the proceeding, and may award damages for loss, other than anticipated profits, suffered by the corporation or another party because of enjoining the unauthorized act.\n\n89 Acts, ch 288, §28",

A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by section 490.626, subsection 2. Unless so noted, or contained, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.\n\n3. A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized for any of the following purposes:\n\na. To maintain the corporation’s status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders.\n\nb. To preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law.\n\nc. For any other reasonable purpose.\n\n4. A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may do any of the following:\n\na. Obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares.\n\nb. Obligate the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, to acquire the restricted shares.\n\nc. Require the corporation, the holders of any class or series of its shares, or other persons to approve the transfer of the restricted shares, if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable.\n\nd. Prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly unreasonable.\n\n5. As used in this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.\n\n89 Acts, ch 288, §48; 2021 Acts, ch 165, §54, 230\n\nReferred to in §490.626",

The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation’s unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.\n\n2. A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “the corporation elects to have preemptive rights”, or words of similar effect, means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:\n\na. The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation’s unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.\n\nb. A preemptive right may be waived by a shareholder. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.\n\nc. There is no preemptive right with respect to any of the following:\n\n(1) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, employees, or agents of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates.\n\n(2) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, employees, or agents of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates.\n\n(3) Shares authorized in the articles of incorporation that are issued within six months from the effective date of incorporation.\n\n(4) Shares sold otherwise than for cash.\n\nd.

Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights.

If the board of directors does not fix a record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, the record date is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.\n\n3. A distribution shall not be made if, after giving it effect, any of the following would result:\n\na. The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.\n\nb. The corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.\n\n4. The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection 3 either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n5. Except as provided in subsection 7, the effect of a distribution under subsection 3 is measured as follows:\n\na. In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, as of the earlier of the following:\n\n(1) The date cash or other property is transferred or debt to a shareholder is incurred by the corporation.\n\n(2) The date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares.\n\nb.

In all other cases, as of the following:\n\n(1) The date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization.\n\n(2) The date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization.\n\n6. A corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.\n\n7. Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection 3 if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If such indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.\n\n8.

A shareholder and the shareholder’s agent or attorney who inspects or is furnished a copy of a list of shareholders under this subsection or under subsection 3 or who copies the list under this subsection may use the information on that list only for purposes related to the meeting and its subject matter and must keep the information on that list confidential.\n\n3. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the corporation shall make the list of shareholders entitled to vote available at the meeting and any adjournment, and any shareholder, or the shareholder’s agent or attorney, is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting and any adjournment. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be available for such inspection during the meeting and any adjournment on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The corporation may satisfy its obligation to make such list available for inspection during a meeting by furnishing a copy of the list in the manner described in section 490.1603, subsection 2, to the shareholders prior to the meeting.\n\n4. If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, or the shareholder’s agent or attorney, to inspect a list of shareholders before or at the meeting or any adjournment, or copy a list as permitted by subsection 2, the district court of the county where a corporation’s principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.\n\n5.

As used in this section:\n\na. “Holder” means and “held by” refers to shares held by a record shareholder, a beneficial shareholder, or an unrestricted voting trust beneficial owner.\n\nb. “Qualified shares” means all shares entitled to be voted with respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes either knows, or under subsection 2 is notified, are held by any of the following:\n\n(1) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction.\n\n(2) A related person of the director, excluding a person described in section 490.860, subsection 5, paragraph “f”.\n\n4. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsection 5, shareholders’ action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.\n\n5. If a shareholders’ vote does not comply with subsection 1 solely because of a director’s failure to comply with subsection 2, and if the director establishes that the failure was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome of the vote, the court may take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and may give such effect, if any, to the shareholders’ vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n6. Where shareholders’ action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements shall be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares that are not qualified shares may participate.\n\n2013 Acts, ch 31, §43, 82; 2013 Acts, ch 140, §71; 2021 Acts, ch 165, §122, 230\n\nReferred to in §490.831, 490.861, 490.870, 490.1340, 491.16A",

The eligible interest holder shall have such rights of contribution from other persons as are provided by the organic law of the eligible entity with respect to any interest holder liabilities preserved by paragraph “a”, as if the conversion had not occurred.\n\nd. The eligible interest holder shall not, by reason of such prior interest holder liability, have interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arise after the conversion becomes effective.\n\n5. A conversion does not require the converting entity to wind up its affairs and does not constitute or cause the dissolution or termination of the entity.\n\n6. Property held for charitable purposes under the laws of this state by a corporation or a domestic or foreign eligible entity immediately before a conversion shall not, as a result of the transaction, be diverted from the objects for which it was donated, granted, devised, or otherwise transferred except and to the extent permitted by or pursuant to the laws of this state addressing cy pres or dealing with nondiversion of charitable assets.\n\n7. A bequest, devise, gift, grant, or promise contained in a will or other instrument of donation, subscription, or conveyance which is made to the converting entity and which takes effect or remains payable after the conversion inures to the converted entity.\n\n8. A trust obligation that would govern property if transferred to the converting entity applies to property that is transferred to the converted entity after the conversion takes effect.\n\n2021 Acts, ch 165, §139, 230",

      "text": "490.1104 Action on a plan of merger or share exchange.\n\nIn the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger or the acquired entity in a share exchange, the plan of merger or share exchange shall be adopted in the following manner:\n\n1. The plan of merger or share exchange shall first be adopted by the board of directors.\n\n2. a. Except as provided in subsections 8, 10, and 12, and in section 490.1105, the plan of merger or share exchange shall then be approved by the shareholders. In submitting the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan, or, in the case of an offer referred to in subsection 10, paragraph “b”, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless any of the following apply:\n\n(1) The board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation.\n\n(2) Section 490.826 applies.\n\nb. If either paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1) or (2), applies, the board shall inform the shareholders of the basis for its so proceeding.\n\n3. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of merger or share exchange.\n\n4. If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing foreign or domestic corporation or eligible entity, the notice must also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or the organic rules of that corporation or eligible entity. If the corporation is to be merged with a domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity and a new domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice must include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or the organic rules of the new corporation or eligible entity.\n\n5. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection 3, require a greater vote or a greater quorum, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists consisting of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present consisting of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the merger or share exchange by that voting group.\n\n6. Subject to subsection 7, separate voting by voting groups is required for each of the following:\n\na. On a plan of merger, by each class or series of shares that are any of the following:\n\n(1) To be converted under the plan of merger into shares, other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or eligible interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing.\n\n(2) Entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that constitutes a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of a surviving corporation that requires action by separate voting groups under section 490.1004.\n\nb. On a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group.\n\nc. On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or share exchange, respectively.\n\n7. The articles of incorporation may expressly limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subsection 6, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), and subsection 6, paragraph “b”, as to any class or series of shares, except when all of the following apply:\n\na. The plan of merger or share exchange includes what is or would be in effect an amendment subject to subsection 6, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (2).\n\nb. The plan of merger or share exchange will not effect a substantive business combination.\n\n8. Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation’s shareholders of a plan of merger is not required if all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\na. The corporation will survive the merger.\n\nb. Except for amendments permitted by section 490.1005, its articles of incorporation will not be changed.\n\nc. Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, rights, and limitations, immediately after the effective date of the merger.\n\nd. The issuance in the merger of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares does not require a vote under section 490.621, subsection 6.\n\n9. a. If, as a result of a merger or share exchange, one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new interest holder liability, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the signing in connection with the transaction, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such new interest holder liability.\n\nb. Paragraph “a” does not apply in the case of a shareholder that already has interest holder liability with respect to such domestic corporation, if all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The new interest holder liability is with respect to a domestic or foreign corporation, which may be a different or the same domestic corporation in which the person is a shareholder.\n\n(2) The terms and conditions of the new interest holder liability are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability, other than for changes that eliminate or reduce such interest holder liability.\n\n10.

The plan of merger or share exchange expressly permits or requires the merger or share exchange to be effected under this subsection and provides that, if the merger or share exchange is to be effected under this subsection, the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the requirement set forth in paragraph “f”.\n\nb. Another party to the merger, the acquiring entity in the share exchange, or a parent of another party to the merger or the acquiring entity in the share exchange, makes an offer to purchase, on the terms provided in the plan of merger or share exchange, any and all of the outstanding shares of the corporation that, absent this subsection, would be entitled to vote on the plan of merger or share exchange, except that the offer may exclude shares of the corporation that are owned at the commencement of the offer by the corporation, the offeror, or any parent of the offeror, or by any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing.\n\nc. The offer discloses that the plan of merger or share exchange provides that the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the requirement set forth in paragraph “f” and that the shares of the corporation that are not tendered in response to the offer will be treated as set forth in paragraph “h”.\n\nd. The offer remains open for at least ten days.\n\ne. The offeror purchases all shares properly tendered in response to the offer and not properly withdrawn.\n\nf. The shares listed below are collectively entitled to cast at least the minimum number of votes on the merger or share exchange that, absent this subsection, would be required by this subchapter and by the articles of incorporation for the approval of the merger or share exchange by the shareholders and by any other voting group entitled to vote on the merger or share exchange at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the approval were present and voted:\n\n(1) Shares purchased by the offeror in accordance with the offer.\n\n(2) Shares otherwise owned by the offeror or by any parent of the offeror or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing.\n\n(3) Shares subject to an agreement that they are to be transferred, contributed, or delivered to the offeror, any parent of the offeror, or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing in exchange for shares or eligible interests in such offeror, parent, or subsidiary.\n\ng. The offeror or a wholly owned subsidiary of the offeror merges with or into, or effects a share exchange in which it acquires shares of, the corporation.\n\nh. Each outstanding share of each class or series of shares of the corporation that the offeror is offering to purchase in accordance with the offer, and that is not purchased in accordance with the offer, is to be converted in the merger into, or into the right to receive, or is to be exchanged in the share exchange for, or for the right to receive, the same amount and kind of securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights, cash, or other property to be paid or exchanged in accordance with the offer for each share of that class or series of shares that is tendered in response to the offer, except that shares of the corporation that are owned by the corporation or that are described in paragraph “f”, subparagraph (2) or (3), need not be converted into or exchanged for the consideration described in this paragraph “h”.\n\n11. As used in subsection 10:\n\na. “Offer” means the offer referred to in subsection 10, paragraph “b”.\n\nb. “Offeror” means the person making the offer.\n\nc. “Parent” of an entity means a person that owns, directly or indirectly, through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares of or eligible interests in that entity.\n\nd. Shares tendered in response to the offer shall be deemed to have been “purchased” in accordance with the offer at the earliest time as of which the following applies:\n\n(1) The offeror has irrevocably accepted those shares for payment.\n\n(2) Either of the following applies:\n\n(a) In the case of shares represented by certificates, the offeror, or the offeror’s designated depository or other agent, has physically received the certificates representing those shares.\n\n(b) In the case of shares without certificates, those shares have been transferred into the account of the offeror or its designated depository or other agent, or an agent’s message relating to those shares has been received by the offeror or its designated depository or other agent.\n\ne. “Wholly owned subsidiary” of a person means an entity of or in which that person owns, directly or indirectly, through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares or eligible interests.\n\n12. Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, all of the following applies:\n\na. Approval of a plan of share exchange by the shareholders of a domestic corporation is not required if the corporation is the acquiring entity in the share exchange.\n\nb. Shares not to be exchanged under the plan of share exchange are not entitled to vote on the plan.\n\n89 Acts, ch 288, §124; 2002 Acts, ch 1154, §68, 125; 2013 Acts, ch 31, §46, 82; 2021 Acts, ch 165, §151, 230\n\nReferred to in §490.1105, 490.1302, 490.1320, 490.1321, 508B.2, 515G.2, 524.1402",

If a person has interest holder liability both before and after a merger becomes effective with unchanged terms and conditions with respect to the entity that is the survivor by reason of owning the same shares or eligible interests before and after the merger becomes effective, the merger has no effect on such interest holder liability.\n\nd. A share exchange has no effect on interest holder liability related to shares or eligible interests of the acquired entity that were not exchanged in the share exchange.\n\n4. Upon a merger becoming effective, a foreign corporation, or a foreign eligible entity, that is the survivor of the merger is deemed to have done all of the following:\n\na.

Except as provided in the organic law governing a party to a merger or in its articles of incorporation or organic rules, the merger does not give rise to any rights that an interest holder, governor, or third party would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of that party.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless any of the following apply:\n\na. Prior to the time the shareholder became an interested shareholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder.\n\nb. Upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least eighty-five percent of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, those shares owned by persons who are directors and officers, and by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer.\n\nc. At or subsequent to the time the shareholder became an interested shareholder, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested shareholder. Such approval shall not be by written consent.\n\n2. a. This section does not apply in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is listed on a national securities exchange, authorized for quotation on the national association of securities dealers automated quotations – national market system, or held of record by more than two thousand shareholders, unless any of the foregoing results from action taken, directly or indirectly, by an interested shareholder or from a transaction in which a person becomes an interested shareholder.\n\n(2) The corporation’s original articles of incorporation contain a provision expressly electing not to be governed by this section.\n\n(3) The corporation, by action of its board of directors, adopts an amendment to its bylaws by no later than September 29, 1997, expressly electing not to be governed by this section, which amendment shall not be further amended by the board of directors.\n\n(4) (a) The corporation, by action of its shareholders, adopts an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to be governed by this section, provided that, in addition to any other vote required by law, such amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote. An amendment adopted pursuant to this subparagraph is effective immediately in the case of a corporation that has never had a class of voting stock that falls within any of the three categories set out in subparagraph (1) and has not elected by a provision in its original articles of incorporation or any amendment to such articles to be governed by this section. In all other cases, an amendment adopted pursuant to this subparagraph is not effective until twelve months after the adoption of the amendment and does not apply to any business combination between the corporation and any person who became an interested shareholder of the corporation on or prior to such adoption.\n\n(b) An amendment to the bylaws adopted pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be further amended by the board of directors.\n\n(5) A shareholder becomes an interested shareholder inadvertently and both of the following apply:\n\n(a) As soon as practicable the shareholder divests itself of ownership of sufficient shares so that the shareholder ceases to be an interested shareholder.\n\n(b) The shareholder would not, at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a business combination between the corporation and such shareholder, have been an interested shareholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership.\n\n(6) (a) The business combination is proposed prior to the consummation or abandonment of and subsequent to the earlier of the public announcement or the notice required in this subparagraph of a proposed transaction which satisfies all of the following:\n\n(i) Constitutes a transaction described in subparagraph division (b).\n\n(ii) Is with or by a person who either was not an interested shareholder during the previous three years or who became an interested shareholder with the approval of the corporation’s board of directors or who became an interested shareholder during the time period described in subparagraph (7).\n\n(iii) Is approved or not opposed by a majority of the members of the board of directors then in office who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested shareholder during the previous three years, or who were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors.\n\n(b) A proposed transaction under subparagraph division (a) is limited to the following:\n\n(i) A merger of the corporation, other than a merger pursuant to section 490.1105.\n\n(ii) A sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, or other disposition, in one or more transactions and whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation, other than to a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation or to the corporation itself, which has an aggregate market value equal to fifty percent or more of either the aggregate market value of all of the assets of the corporation determined on a consolidated basis, or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock of the corporation.\n\n(iii) A proposed tender or exchange offer for fifty percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation.\n\n(c) The corporation shall give no less than twenty days’ notice to all interested shareholders prior to the consummation of any of the transactions described in subparagraph division (b), subparagraph subdivision (i) or (ii).\n\n(7) The business combination is with an interested shareholder who becomes an interested shareholder of the corporation at a time when the corporation is not subject to this section pursuant to subparagraph (1), (2), (3), or (4).\n\nb. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, subparagraphs (1) through (4), a corporation may elect under its original articles of incorporation or any amendment to such articles to be subject to this section. However, such amendment shall not apply to restrict a business combination between the corporation and an interested shareholder of the corporation if the interested shareholder became such prior to the effective date of the amendment.\n\n3. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na. “Affiliate” means a person that directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, another person.\n\nb. “Associate”, when used to indicate a relationship with a person, means any of the following:\n\n(1) A corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, or other entity of which the person is a director, officer, or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the owner of twenty percent or more of any class of voting stock.\n\n(2) A trust or other estate in which the person has at least a twenty percent beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity.\n\n(3) A relative or spouse of the person, or any relative of the spouse, who has the same residence as the person.\n\nc. “Business combination”, with respect to a corporation and an interested shareholder of such corporation, means any of the following:\n\n(1) A merger or consolidation of the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation with the interested shareholder, or with any other corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, or other entity if the merger or consolidation is caused by the interested shareholder and as a result of such merger the surviving entity is not subject to subsection 1.\n\n(2) A sales, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, except proportionately as a shareholder of such corporation, to or with the interested shareholder, whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation which assets have an aggregate market value equal to ten percent or more of either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the corporation determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock of the corporation.\n\n(3) A transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation or by any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation of any stock of the corporation or of such subsidiary to the interested shareholder, except for the following:\n\n(a) Pursuant to the exercise, exchange, or conversion of securities exercisable for, exchangeable for, or convertible into stock of the corporation or such subsidiary which securities were outstanding prior to the time that the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder.\n\n(b) Pursuant to a merger under section 490.1105.\n\n(c) Pursuant to a distribution paid or made, or the exercise, exchange, or conversion of securities exercisable for, exchangeable for, or convertible into stock of such corporation or any such subsidiary, which stock is distributed pro rata to all holders of a class or series of stock of the corporation subsequent to the time the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder.\n\n(d) Pursuant to an exchange offer by the corporation to purchase stock made on the same terms to all holders of the stock.\n\n(e) Any issuance or transfer of stock by the corporation, provided, however, that in no case under subparagraph divisions (c) and (d) and this subparagraph division shall there be an increase in the interested shareholder’s proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation or of the voting stock of the corporation.\n\n(4) A transaction involving the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series, or securities convertible into the stock of any class or series, of the corporation or of any such subsidiary which is owned by the interested shareholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any shares of stock not caused, directly or indirectly, by the interested shareholder.\n\n(5) The receipt by the interested shareholder of the benefit, directly or indirectly, except proportionately as a shareholder of such corporation, of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial benefits, other than those expressly permitted in subparagraphs (1) through (4), provided by or through the corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary.\n\nd. “Control”, including the terms “controlling”, “controlled by”, and “under common control with”, means the ability, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting stock, by contract, or otherwise. A person who is the owner of twenty percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of any corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, or other entity is presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding this paragraph, a presumption of control shall not apply where a person holds voting stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this section, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian, or trustee for one or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.\n\ne. “Interested shareholder” means any person, other than the corporation and any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation, that is the owner of ten percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of ten percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested shareholder, and the affiliates and associates of such person. “Interested shareholder” does not include a person whose ownership of shares in excess of the ten percent limitation is the result of action taken solely by the corporation, provided that such person is an interested shareholder if, after such action by the corporation, the person acquires additional shares of voting stock of the corporation, other than as a result of further corporate action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person. For purposes of determining whether a person is an interested shareholder, the outstanding voting stock of the corporation does not include any other unissued stock of the corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options, or otherwise.\n\nf. “Owner”, including the terms “own” and “owned” when used with respect to any stock, means a person that individually or with or through any of such person’s affiliates or associates satisfies any of the following:\n\n(1) Beneficially owns such stock, directly or indirectly.\n\n(2) Has the right to do either of the following:\n\n(a) Acquire such stock, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants, or options, or otherwise. However, a person is not deemed the owner of stock tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of such person’s affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is accepted for purchase or exchange.\n\n(b) Vote such stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding. However, a person is not deemed the owner of any stock because of such person’s right to vote such stock if the agreement, arrangement, or understanding to vote such stock arises solely from the revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to ten or more persons.\n\n(3) Has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of such stock with any other person who beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such stock.

A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, other than a disposition described in section 490.1201, requires approval of the corporation’s shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. A corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity if it retains a business activity that represented, for the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at least twenty-five percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and either twenty-five percent of either income from continuing operations before taxes or twenty-five percent of revenues from continuing operations, in each case for the most recently completed fiscal year; but no presumption that the disposition will leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity shall arise from the fact that the corporation’s continuing business activity does not equal or exceed any of these percentages.\n\n2. To obtain the approval of the shareholders under subsection 1, all of the following shall apply:\n\na. The board of directors shall first adopt a resolution authorizing the disposition. The disposition shall then be approved by the shareholders. In submitting the disposition to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the disposition, unless any of the following apply:\n\n(1) The board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation.\n\n(2) Section 490.826 applies.\n\nb. If paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1) or (2), applies, the board shall inform the shareholders of the basis for its so proceeding.\n\n3. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval by the shareholders of a disposition or the effectiveness of the disposition.\n\n4. If a disposition is required to be approved by the shareholders under subsection 1, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the disposition is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and must contain a description of the disposition, including the terms and conditions of the disposition and the consideration to be received by the corporation.\n\n5. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection 3 require a greater vote or a greater quorum, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists consisting of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the disposition.\n\n6. After a disposition has been approved by the shareholders under this subchapter, and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned by the corporation without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of other parties to the disposition.\n\n7. A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under subchapter XIV is not governed by this section.\n\n8. The assets of a direct or indirect consolidated subsidiary shall be deemed to be the assets of the parent corporation for the purposes of this section.\n\n89 Acts, ch 288, §130; 2002 Acts, ch 1154, §77, 125; 2013 Acts, ch 31, §49, 82; 2019 Acts, ch 24, §104; 2021 Acts, ch 165, §157, 230\n\nReferred to in §490.1302",

The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation under section 490.504.\n\n3.

An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.\n\n2. An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of the petition under section 490.1430, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days after the effectiveness of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under section 490.1430, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, shall not be discontinued or settled, nor shall the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholder’s shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.\n\n3. If, within sixty days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner’s shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of the petitioner’s shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.\n\n4. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection 3, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under section 490.1430, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, and determine the fair value of the petitioner’s shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under section 490.1430, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n5. Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating the petitioner’s shares among holders of different classes or series of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes or series insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes or series shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under section 490.1430, subsection 1, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2) or (4), it may award expenses to the petitioning shareholder.\n\n6.

The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection 5 shall be made within ten days after the date the order becomes final.\n\n8.
