The issuer or a broker-dealer offering or selling the securities is not or would not be disqualified under rule 505, 17 C.F.R. §230.505(b)(2)(iii), adopted under the federal Securities Act of 1933.\n\nd.

The administrator shall retain the filing fee even if the notice filing is withdrawn or the registration is withdrawn, denied, suspended, revoked, or abandoned. The fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited as provided in section 505.7. The administrator may adopt rules requiring a filing to be made electronically.

In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record shall not be required under subsection 9 or section 502.304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable effort or expense.\n\n6. Escrow and impoundment. A rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous five years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere.

Effective period. Except while a stop order is in effect under section 502.306, a registration statement is effective for one year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order issued under this chapter during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker-dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this chapter are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement shall not be withdrawn until one year after its effective date. A registration statement may be withdrawn only with the approval of the administrator.\n\n9. Periodic reports. While a registration statement is effective, a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may require the person that filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep the information or other record in the registration statement reasonably current and to disclose the progress of the offering.\n\n98 Acts, ch 1106, §13, 24; 99 Acts, ch 166, §5; 2004 Acts, ch 1161, §14, 68; 2009 Acts, ch 181, §59; 2010 Acts, ch 1121, §3; 2016 Acts, ch 1122, §2, 3\n\nReferred to in §502.201, 502.202, 502.203, 502.204, 502.303, 502.304, 502.304A, 502.306, 502.307, 502.607",

The issuer’s enterprise or method of business includes or would include activities that are unlawful where performed.\n\ne. With respect to a security sought to be registered under section 502.303, there has been a failure to comply with the undertaking required by section 502.303, subsection 2, paragraph “d”.\n\nf. The applicant or registrant has not paid the filing fee, but the administrator shall void the order if the deficiency is corrected.\n\ng. The offering is subject to any of the following:\n\n(1) Will work or tend to work a fraud upon purchasers or would so operate.\n\n(2) Has been or would be made with unreasonable amounts of underwriters’ and sellers’ discounts, commissions, or other compensation, or promoters’ profits or participations, or unreasonable amounts or kinds of options.\n\nh. The financial condition of the issuer affects or would affect the soundness of the securities, except that applications for registration of securities by companies which are in the development stage shall not be denied based solely upon the financial condition of the company. For purposes of this paragraph, a “development stage company” is defined as a company which has been in existence for five years or less.\n\ni. A person who is an issuer, correspondent, or applicant, as listed on the uniform application to register securities form known as “Form U-1”, has abandoned the registration statement. The administrator may enter an order pursuant to this paragraph if a notice of abandonment is sent to the last known address of each person, and the person fails to take corrective action within the time specified by the administrator. The notice of abandonment shall state the reasons for the administrator’s action, specify the corrective action required, and specify the time period for submitting a response. However, the time specified shall not be less than fifteen days.\n\n2. Enforcement of subsection 1, paragraph “g”. To the extent practicable, the administrator by rule adopted or order issued under this chapter shall publish standards that provide notice of conduct that violates subsection 1, paragraph “g”.\n\n3. Institution of stop order. The administrator shall not institute a stop order proceeding against an effective registration statement on the basis of conduct or a transaction known to the administrator when the registration statement became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the registration statement became effective.\n\n4. Summary process. The administrator may summarily revoke, deny, postpone, or suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement pending final determination of an administrative proceeding. Upon the issuance of the order, the administrator shall promptly notify each person specified in subsection 5 that the order has been issued, the reasons for the revocation, denial, postponement, or suspension, and that within fifteen days after the receipt of a request in a record from the person the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the administrator, within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the administrator, after notice of and opportunity for hearing for each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend the order until final determination.\n\n5. Procedural requirements for stop order. A stop order shall not be issued under this section without all of the following:\n\na. An appropriate notice to the applicant or registrant, the issuer, and the person on whose behalf the securities are to be or have been offered.\n\nb. An opportunity for hearing.\n\nc.

Liability of purchaser to seller. A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission.

The tender referred to in paragraph “a” may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness to take delivery of the security for the amount specified.

A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person is liable to the other person. An action under this subsection is governed by all of the following:\n\na.

This subsection does not apply to a broker-dealer or its agents if the investment advice provided is solely incidental to transacting business as a broker-dealer and no special compensation is received for the investment advice.\n\n7. Joint and several liability. The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections 2 through 6:\n\na. A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections 2 through 6, unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.\n\nb. An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections 2 through 6, including an individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.\n\nc. An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections 2 through 6 or a person, whether an employee of such person or otherwise, who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation, and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.\n\nd. A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections 2 through 6, unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.\n\n8. Right of contribution. A person liable under this section has a right of contribution as in cases of contract against any other person liable under this section for the same conduct.\n\n9.

A person that has made, or has engaged in the performance of, a contract in violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter, or that has acquired a purported right under the contract with knowledge of conduct by reason of which its making or performance was in violation of this chapter, shall not base an action on the contract.\n\n12. No contractual waiver. A condition, stipulation, or provision binding a person purchasing or selling a security or receiving investment advice to waive compliance with this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter is void.\n\n13. Survival of other rights or remedies. The rights and remedies provided by this chapter are in addition to any other rights or remedies that may exist, but this chapter does not create a cause of action not specified in this section or section 502.411, subsection 5.\n\n13A. Informational filing with the administrator. A copy of any suit or arbitration action filed under this section shall be served upon the administrator within twenty days of the filing in the form and manner prescribed by the administrator by rule or order, provided that all of the following apply:\n\na.

Any person who violates section 502.321B shall be liable to the person selling the security to such violator, which seller may sue either at law or in equity to recover the security, costs, and reasonable attorney fees, plus any income or distributions, in cash or in kind, received by the purchaser thereon, upon tender of the consideration received, or for damages if the purchaser no longer owns the security. Damages shall be the excess of the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, plus interest at the legal rate from the date of disposition, over the consideration paid for the security. Tender requires only notice of willingness to pay the amount specified in exchange for the security. Any notice may be given by service as in civil actions or by certified mail to the last known address of the person liable.\n\nb. In addition to other remedies provided in this chapter, in a proceeding alleging a violation of article 3A, the court may provide that all shares acquired from a resident of this state in violation of any provision of this chapter or rule or order issued pursuant to this chapter be denied voting rights for one year after acquisition, that the shares be nontransferable on the books of the target company, or that during this one-year period the target company have the option to call the shares for redemption either at the price at which the shares were acquired or at book value per share as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ended prior to the date of the call for redemption, which redemption shall occur on the date set in the call notice but not later than sixty days after the call notice is given.\n\n2004 Acts, ch 1161, §48, 68; 2012 Acts, ch 1023, §157\n\nReferred to in §502.411, 502.510, 502.610",

If the administrator determines that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter or that a person has materially aided, is materially aiding, or is about to materially aid an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter, the administrator may do any of the following:\n\na. Issue an order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in the act, practice, or course of business or to take other action necessary or appropriate to comply with this chapter.\n\nb. Issue an order denying, suspending, revoking, or conditioning the exemptions for a broker-dealer under section 502.401, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (4) or (6), or an investment adviser under section 502.403, subsection 2, paragraph “a”, subparagraph (3).\n\nc. Issue an order under section 502.204.\n\n2. Summary process. An order under subsection 1 is effective on the date of issuance. Upon issuance of the order, the administrator shall promptly serve each person subject to the order with a copy of the order and a notice that the order has been entered. The order must include a statement of any restitution order, civil penalty, or costs of investigation the administrator will seek, a statement of the reasons for the order, and notice that, within thirty days after receipt of a request in a record from the person, the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and none is ordered by the administrator within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order, including an order for restitution, the imposition of a civil penalty, or a requirement for payment of costs of investigation sought in the order, becomes final as to that person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the administrator, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.\n\n3. Procedure for final order. If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection 2, a hearing must be held pursuant to chapter 17A. A final order shall not be issued unless the administrator makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with chapter 17A. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection 1.\n\n4. Civil penalty — restitution — corrective action. In a final order under subsection 3, the administrator may impose a civil penalty up to an amount not to exceed a maximum of ten thousand dollars for a single violation or one million dollars for more than one violation, or in an amount as agreed to by the parties, order restitution, or take other corrective action as the administrator deems necessary and appropriate to accomplish compliance with the laws of the state relating to all securities business transacted in the state.\n\n5. Costs. In a final order, the administrator may charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter.\n\n5A. Failure to obey cease and desist order. A person who fails to obey a valid cease and desist order issued by the administrator under this section may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, be subject to a civil penalty in an amount of not less than one thousand dollars and not to exceed ten thousand dollars for violating the order. Each day the failure to obey the cease and desist order occurs or continues constitutes a separate violation of the order. The penalties provided in this subsection are in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may be available.\n\n6. Filing of certified final order with court — effect of filing. If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with section 502.609, the administrator may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.\n\n7. Enforcement by court — further civil penalty. If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the administrator may petition the Polk county district court or the district court for the county in which the person resides or is located to enforce the order. The court shall not require the administrator to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not less than three thousand dollars but not greater than ten thousand dollars for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.\n\n[C31, 35, §8581-c17; C39, §8581.21; C46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 71, 73, 75, §502.21(5); C77, 79, 81, §502.604]\n\n91 Acts, ch 40, §33; 96 Acts, ch 1025, §14; 99 Acts, ch 166, §8; 2000 Acts, ch 1147, §17; 2001 Acts, ch 118, §10, 11; 2004 Acts, ch 1161, §53, 68; 2007 Acts, ch 137, §5; 2011 Acts, ch 70, §1; 2013 Acts, ch 124, §5, 6\n\nReferred to in §502.204, 502.604A",

The administrator may make examinations within or without the state, of the business and records of each joint investment trust, at the times and in the scope as the administrator determines. The administrator shall have the authority to contract for outside professional services in the conduct of examinations. The examinations may be made without prior notice to the joint investment trust or the trust’s investment advisor. The administrator may copy all records the administrator feels are necessary to conduct the examination. The expense reasonably attributable to the examination shall be paid by the joint investment trusts whose business is examined. For the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of examinations, the administrator may cooperate with other regulatory authorities.\n\n92 Acts, ch 1156, §41; 2005 Acts, ch 19, §124, 126",
