A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the cooperative solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:\n\na. The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board or a board committee and the board or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.

The vote of those voting interests, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. A majority of the votes, whether or not the members are present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this paragraph constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this paragraph.\n\nc.
