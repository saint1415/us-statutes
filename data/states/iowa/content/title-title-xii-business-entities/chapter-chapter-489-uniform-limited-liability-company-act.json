The first biennial report in this state must be delivered to the secretary of state between January 1 and April 1 of the first odd-numbered year following the calendar year in which a limited liability company was formed or a foreign limited liability company was registered to do business.

A manager may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the members without notice or cause.\n\ne. A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member.\n\nf. A person’s ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation, or other liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.\n\n4. An action requiring the vote or consent of members under this chapter may be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote, consent, or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member’s agent.\n\n5.

When a person other than a member of record becomes entitled to have interests of a professional limited liability company transferred into that person’s name or to exercise voting rights, except as a proxy, with respect to interests of the professional limited liability company, the professional limited liability company shall immediately purchase the interests. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this section shall be applicable whether the event occurs as a result of appointment of a guardian or conservator for a member or the member’s property, transfer of interests by operation of law, involuntary transfer of interests, judicial proceeding, execution, levy, bankruptcy proceeding, receivership proceeding, foreclosure or enforcement of a pledge or encumbrance, or any other situation or occurrence. However, this section does not apply to any voluntary transfer of interests as defined in this subchapter.\n\n5.

However, the interests shall promptly be transferred on the books and records of the professional limited liability company as of the transfer date, notwithstanding any delay in transferring or surrendering the interests or certificates representing the interests, and the transfer shall be valid and effective for all purposes as of the close of business on the transfer date. The purchase price for such interests shall be paid as provided in this subchapter, but the transfer of interests to the professional limited liability company as provided in this section shall not be delayed or affected by any delay or default in making payment.\n\n6. a. Notwithstanding subsections 1 through 5, purchase by the professional limited liability company is not required upon the occurrence of any event other than death of a member, if the professional limited liability company is dissolved within sixty days after the occurrence of the event or voluntarily elects to no longer be a professional limited liability company but continue its existence as a limited liability company pursuant to section 489.1119 within sixty days after the occurrence of the event. The certificate of organization or operating agreement of the professional limited liability company may provide that purchase is not required upon the death of a member, if the professional limited liability company is dissolved within sixty days after the date of the member’s death.\n\nb.

Book value shall be determined from the books and records of the professional limited liability company in accordance with the regular method of accounting used by the professional limited liability company, uniformly and consistently applied. Adjustments to book value shall be made, if necessary, to take into account work in process and accounts receivable. A final determination of book value made in good faith by an independent certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants employed by the professional limited liability company for the purpose shall be conclusive on all persons.\n\nb. The purchase price shall be paid in cash as follows:\n\n(1) Upon the death of a member, thirty percent of the purchase price shall be paid within ninety days after death, and the balance shall be paid in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the death.\n\n(2) Upon the happening of any other event referred to in this section, one-tenth of the purchase price shall be paid within ninety days after the date of the event, and the balance shall be paid in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of the event.\n\nc. Interest from the date of death or other event shall be payable annually on principal payment dates, at the rate of six percent per annum on the unpaid balance of the purchase price.\n\nd. All persons who are members of the professional limited liability company on the date of death or other event, and their executors, administrators, and legal representatives, shall, to the extent the professional limited liability company fails to meet its obligations under this section, be jointly liable for the payment of the purchase price and interest in proportion to their percentage of ownership of the professional limited liability company’s interests, disregarding interests of the deceased or withdrawing member.\n\ne. The part of the purchase price remaining unpaid after the initial payment shall be evidenced by a negotiable promissory note, which shall be executed by the professional limited liability company and all members liable for payment. Any person liable on the note shall have the right to prepay the note in full or in part at any time.\n\nf. If the person making any payment is not reasonably able to determine which of two or more persons is entitled to receive a payment, or if the payment is payable to a person who is unknown, or who is under disability and there is no person legally competent to receive the payment, or who cannot be found after the exercise of reasonable diligence by the person making the payment, it shall be deposited with the treasurer of state and shall be subject to the provisions of section 490.1440 with respect to funds deposited with the treasurer of state upon the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of a business corporation.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no part of the purchase price shall be required to be paid until the certificates, if any, representing the interests have been surrendered to the professional limited liability company.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, payment of any part of the purchase price for interests of a deceased member shall not be required until the executor or administrator of the deceased member provides any indemnity, release, or other document from any taxing authority, which is reasonably necessary to protect the professional limited liability company against liability for estate, inheritance, and death taxes.\n\n10. The certificate of organization or an operating agreement of the professional limited liability company or an agreement among all members of a professional limited liability company may provide for a different purchase price, a different method of determining the purchase price, a different interest rate or no interest, and other terms, conditions, and schedules of payment.\n\n11.
