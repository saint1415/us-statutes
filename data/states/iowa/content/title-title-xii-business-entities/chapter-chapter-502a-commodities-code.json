For purposes of this paragraph, physical delivery shall be deemed to have occurred if both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(1) Within twenty-eight days, the required quantity of precious metals purchased by the payment is delivered, whether in specifically segregated or fungible bulk form, into the possession of a depository, other than the seller, which is any of the following:\n\n(a) A financial institution.\n\n(b) A depository the warehouse receipts of which are recognized for delivery purposes for any commodity on a contract market designated by the commodity futures trading commission.\n\n(c) A storage facility licensed or regulated by the United States or any agency of the United States.\n\n(d) A depository designated by the administrator.\n\n(2) The depository or a qualified seller issues and the purchaser receives, a certificate, document of title, confirmation, or other instrument evidencing that the required quantity of precious metals has been delivered to the depository and is being and will continue to be held by the depository on the purchaser’s behalf, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, other than liens of the purchaser, tax liens, liens agreed to by the purchaser, or liens of the depository for fees and expenses, which have previously been disclosed to the purchaser.\n\nc.

The fact that the financial institution takes a security interest in the precious metals sold or makes the proceeds of the loan payable to the seller does not in itself constitute knowing participation in the sale.\n\nd.
