A transaction in which a director of a corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved if either of the following occurs:\n\na. The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board and the board or committee of the board authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.\n\nb. The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.\n\n3. For the purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction under either of the following circumstances:\n\na. If another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction.\n\nb. If another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction.\n\n4.
