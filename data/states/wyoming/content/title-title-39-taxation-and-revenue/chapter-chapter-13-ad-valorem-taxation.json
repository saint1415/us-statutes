All rules, regulations, guidelines, forms and other program information shall be submitted to the department prior to July 1 of the year the deferral program is implemented in the county. The board of county commissioners may implement the program unless disapproved in writing by the department within forty-five (45) days of submission.

The taxpayer shall file an affidavit each year demonstrating qualification including any significant change to his financial status. If the board of county commissioners finds that the taxpayer's financial status to qualify under subdivision (N)(I) of this paragraph has significantly changed, the board of county commissioners shall, by written order, declare any taxes deferred due and payable on an earlier date. Unless declared to be due earlier, any taxes deferred shall be due and payable upon a significant change in the taxpayer's financial status as determined by the board of county commissioners, abandonment of the property, failure to file annually the affidavit required by this paragraph, the death of the property owner or the sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first.

Upon confirmation of the sale by the court, the sheriff shall execute a deed conveying title to the real property to the purchaser in fee simple subject only to the rights of lienholders from junior tax sales.

If the payment is unclaimed within two (2) years the proceeds shall be credited to the county sinking fund.

False claims are punishable as provided by W.S. 6-5-303;\n\n(C) In completing the assessment roll of the county the county assessor shall indicate the assessed value used as a base for computation of the home owner's tax credit and the county treasurer shall collect from the property owner the amount of tax due minus the amount of tax credit allowed.

When it appears to the state treasurer that the monies appropriated are insufficient to reimburse the counties as provided herein, the money available shall be prorated among the counties at an amount less than one hundred percent (100%);\n\n(J) The purpose of this paragraph is to provide general property tax relief for certain persons who own their residences through a system of tax credits and general fund appropriations. The relief provided is to offset in part the general tax burden. Thus, the tax relief provided is determined by reference to property tax assessment and collection mechanisms but is not limited to property tax relief nor formulated upon legislative power to relieve such taxes. It is for the general relief of taxes and grounded upon general legislative power. In adopting this method of reimbursement of property taxes and providing that no local government shall incur any loss of property tax revenue under subparagraph (H) of this paragraph, any bond issues or other matters relying upon the assessed value of a local government for computation shall be predicated upon the assessed value of the local government before computation of tax credits under this paragraph.\n\n(e) Redemption.

If a taxpayer fails to make a deferred payment under this paragraph, all applicable penalties and interest shall be calculated from the date of the missed payment;\n\n(iv) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a taxpayer from voluntarily remitting to the counties any remaining portion of nondelinquent deferred taxes without penalty.",
