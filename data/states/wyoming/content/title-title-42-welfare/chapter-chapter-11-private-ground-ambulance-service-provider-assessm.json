Assessments.\n\n(a) Each private ground ambulance service provider shall pay a private ground ambulance service provider assessment to the department in accordance with this section.\n\n(b) The assessment due under this section shall be imposed each fiscal year in an amount calculated as a uniform percentage of each private ground ambulance service provider's net patient revenue. The assessment rate shall be determined by the department on a prospective basis and shall be based on the percentage of private ground ambulance service provider net patient revenue necessary to generate an amount not to exceed the nonfederal portion of the upper payment limit gap plus the fee authorized by W.S. 42-11-103(d)(i). If a rate enhancement is paid to private ground ambulance service providers pursuant to this chapter, the assessment rate shall include a uniform percentage of each private ground ambulance service provider's net patient revenue necessary to generate the nonfederal portion of all enhanced rates paid under this chapter plus the fee authorized by W.S. 42-11-103(d)(i). In no event shall assessments or the assessment rate exceed the indirect guarantee threshold amount established by 42 C.F.R. 433.68(f)(3)(i) or other federal law.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise determined by the department, the department shall collect and each private ground ambulance service provider shall pay the assessment required by this section on a quarterly basis, each payment constituting twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual assessment determined by the department. The initial payment shall be due not later than forty-five (45) days after the state plan has been approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unless a later date is set by the department. Subsequent payments are due not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter unless a later date is set by the department.\n\n(d) If a private ground ambulance service provider ceases to operate as an ambulance service or for any reason ceases to be subject to the assessment imposed under this chapter, the assessment for the fiscal year in which the cessation occurs shall be adjusted by multiplying the annual assessment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the year during which the private ground ambulance service provider is subject to the assessment and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). Immediately upon ceasing to operate as an ambulance service provider, or otherwise ceasing to be subject to this chapter, the private ground ambulance provider shall pay the assessment for each quarter as adjusted, to the extent not previously paid.",
