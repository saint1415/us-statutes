Hospitals owned or operated by the state or any city, town, county, special district or other political subdivision of the state or local government shall not be required to pay the assessment required by this section.\n\n(b) The assessment due under this section shall be imposed each fiscal year in an amount calculated as a uniform percentage of each hospital's net patient revenue. The assessment rate shall be determined by the department on a prospective basis and shall be based on the percentage of net hospital patient revenue needed to generate an amount not to exceed the nonfederal portion of the upper payment limit gap plus the fee authorized by W.S. 42-9-103(d)(i). In no event shall the assessment rate:\n\n(i) Exceed the indirect guarantee threshold amount established by 42 C.F.R. 433.68(f)(3)(i) or other federal law;\n\n(ii) Exceed two percent (2%) of a hospital's net patient revenue for the first fiscal year in which the hospital is assessed;\n\n(iii) Increase by more than one percent (1%) of a hospital's net patient revenue for each fiscal year following the first fiscal year in which the hospital is assessed without further approval by the legislature.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise determined by the department, the department shall collect and each private hospital shall pay the assessment required by this section on a quarterly basis, each payment constituting twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual assessment determined by the department. The initial payment shall be due not later than forty-five (45) days after the state plan has been approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services unless a later date is set by the department. Subsequent payments are due not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter unless a later date is set by the department.\n\n(d) If a private hospital ceases to operate as a hospital or for any reason ceases to be subject to the assessment imposed under this chapter, the assessment for the fiscal year in which the cessation occurs shall be adjusted by multiplying the annual assessment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the year during which the hospital is subject to the assessment and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). Immediately upon ceasing to operate as a hospital, or otherwise ceasing to be subject to this chapter, the hospital shall pay the assessment for each quarter as adjusted, to the extent not previously paid.",
