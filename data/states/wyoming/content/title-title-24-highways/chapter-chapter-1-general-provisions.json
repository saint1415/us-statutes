      "text": "24-1-101. Public highways defined and established; creation by adverse possession.\n\n(a) On and after January 1, 1924, all roads within this state shall be highways, which have been or may be declared by law to be state or county highways. It shall be the duty of the several boards of county commissioners, within their respective counties, prior to said date, to determine what, if any, such roads now or heretofore traveled but not heretofore officially established and recorded, are necessary or important for the public use as permanent roads, and to cause such roads to be recorded, or if need be laid out, established and recorded, and all roads recorded as aforesaid, shall be highways. No other roads, except roads located on federal public lands prior to October, 1976 which provide access for a private residence or agricultural operation shall be highways upon acceptance by the board of county commissioners of the county where the road is located, shall be highways unless and until lawfully established as such by official authority. Except, nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing the creation or establishment of a public highway right-of-way with reference to state and county highways under the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof. If any such board shall resolve the creation or establishment of a public highway right-of-way based upon the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription, it shall, following the filing of a plat and accurate survey required in accordance with the terms and provisions of W.S. 24-3-109, proceed with the publication of the proposed road for three (3) successive weeks in three (3) successive issues of some official newspaper published in the county, if any such there be, and if no newspaper be published therein, such notice shall be posted in at least three (3) public places along the line of the proposed road, which notice shall be exclusive of all other notices and may be in the following form:\n\nTo all whom it may concern: The board of county commissioners of .... county has resolved the creation and establishment of a public highway right-of-way under the common-law doctrine of prescription in that the road was constructed or substantially maintained by the (either the state or county) for general public use for a period of (ten years or longer) said road commencing at .... in .... county, Wyoming, running thence (here describe in general terms the points and courses thereof), and terminating at ....\n\nAll objections thereto must be filed in writing with the county clerk of said county before noon on the .... day of .... A.D., ...., or such road will be established without reference to such objections.\n\n.... County Clerk\n\nDated .... A.D.\n\n(b) The county commissioners shall cause a copy of the above notice to be mailed by registered or certified mail to all persons owning lands or claiming any interest in any lands over or across which the road is proposed to be created or established. The publication, posting and mailings of such notice shall be a legal and sufficient notice to all persons owning lands or claiming any interest in lands over which the proposed road is to be created or established. No viewers or appraisers shall be appointed, nor shall any damage claims be considered or heard, and the sole objections to be heard by the board shall be directed against the creation or establishment of such right-of-way under the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription. Any objector may appeal from the final decision of the board of the county commissioners to the district court of the county in which the land is situated. Notice of such appeal must be made to the county clerk within thirty (30) days after such decision has been made by the board, or such claim shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Within ten (10) days after the notice of an appeal is filed in his office, the county clerk shall make out and file in the office of the clerk of the district court, in his county, a transcript of the papers on file in his office, and the proceedings of the board in relation to such creation and establishment. The proceedings on appeal shall be governed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If the appeal is upheld the appellant shall be reimbursed by the county for all reasonable costs of asserting his claim.\n\n(c) Only that portion of the state highways actually used, travelled or fenced, which has been used by the general public for a period of ten (10) years or longer, either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof, shall be presumed to be public highways lawfully established as such by official authority and unavailability of records to show such to have been lawfully established shall not rebut this presumption.\n\n(d) Only that portion of county highways, not to exceed sixty-six (66) feet in width, which was actually constructed or substantially maintained by the county and travelled and used by the general public for a period of ten (10) years or longer, either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof, shall be presumed to be public highways lawfully established as such by official authority.",

It may include multiple pipes, where the clear distance between openings is less than one-half (1/2) of the smaller contiguous opening.\n\n(c) When any bridge is to be constructed, which includes either new construction or reconstruction of major load carrying bridge components, upon any road in a county's, city's or town's jurisdiction, the estimated cost of which shall exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), the construction work shall be competitively bid and the bridge work constructed by contract. No contract shall be divided for the purpose of avoiding competitive bidding. The construction work may be described in the published call for bids by stating general requirements. Detailed specifications shall be available to prospective bidders at the county commissioner's office or offices of the governing body of the city or town.\n\n(d) All bridges to be constructed shall be designed by a professional engineer who holds a valid license granted by the Wyoming board of professional engineers and professional land surveyors.\n\n(e) The board of county commissioners of any county or governing body of any city or town shall cause notices of the contract to be let to be published for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation within the state and to take any other means available to achieve as wide a notice as possible, but in no case shall any letting of the contract be held within fifteen (15) days of the last published notice.\n\n(f) The board of county commissioners, or governing body of the city or town shall award any contract to the lowest responsible bidder. The county commissioners or governing body reserves the right to reject any bid and to waive irregularities and informalities in the bidding. No final payment upon any contract shall be made until the bridge is examined and approved by the professional engineer supervising the construction of the bridge and the payment is approved by the county commissioners or governing body of the city or town or their designees. Within ninety (90) days of the bridge being opened to traffic the board of county commissioners or governing body of the city or town shall notify and provide the design, plans, specifications and load rating for the bridge to the chief engineer of the department of transportation so that the department may comply with national bridge inspection standards.\n\n(g) Whenever an emergency arises requiring expenditure of funds for the repair or rebuilding of bridges or approaches to bridges the board of county commissioners or governing body of any city or town may enter into contract for any building or rebuilding of bridges or approaches without advertising for the letting of any contract. An emergency is an occasion requiring repair or rebuilding of a bridge or a portion of a bridge when, on short notice, the bridge has become unsafe or impassable due to events which are beyond the control of the county, city or town.",
