In the event the commission grants a private and not a commercial entrance or access to the highway, the entrance or point of access shall not be used for or in connection with the conduct of any roadside business or other commercial enterprise. The highway authorities are authorized to divide and separate any access facility into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbings, central dividing sections, or other physical separations, or by designating separate roadways by signs, markers, stripes, and the proper lane for such traffic by appropriate signs, markers, stripes and other devices. No person shall have any right of ingress or egress to, from, or across access facilities to or from abutting lands, except at such designated points at which access may be permitted, for the use for which access may be permitted, and upon such terms and conditions as may be specified by proper authority from time to time, or as specifically provided for.",
