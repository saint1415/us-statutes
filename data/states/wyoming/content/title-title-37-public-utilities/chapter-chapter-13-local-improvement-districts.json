If at any time during the organization proceedings the governing body shall be satisfied that the bond first executed or the amount of cash deposited is insufficient in amount, it on its own initiative or at the request of a public utility may require the execution of an additional bond or the deposit of additional cash within a time to be fixed, not less than ten (10) days distant, and upon failure of the petitioners to file or deposit the same, the petition shall be dismissed.",
