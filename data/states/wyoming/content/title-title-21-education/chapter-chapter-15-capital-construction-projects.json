For the purpose of adjusting the gross square footage of educational buildings under this paragraph, the gross square footage of buildings used for the provision of certified child care, developmental preschool and cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section shall not be excluded. For purposes of this section, per student gross square footage criteria prescribed by the statewide building adequacy standards shall be based upon an average daily membership (ADM) computed as defined under W.S. 21-13-101(a)(i) for the prior school year. For purposes of computations under this section, the allowable capacity in educational building gross square footage for each district including portable buildings but excluding buildings used for the provision of certified child care, developmental preschool and cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section, shall be as follows:\n\n(A) Repealed by Laws 2018, ch. 36, 2.\n\n(B) Repealed by Laws 2018, ch. 36, 2.\n\n(C) For school year 2009-2010 and each school year thereafter, up to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the prescribed per student gross square footage criteria.\n\n(iv) The square footage of any district building or facility which is closed and not operational, is not being replaced under a district's facility plan under W.S. 21-15-116, is not determined surplus by the department and is specified as a closed building within the district's facility plan as a cost efficient means to address future district building needs, shall be segregated from the square footage of other district buildings and facilities and multiplied by the replacement value under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the appropriate building category. The resulting amount shall then be multiplied by an exterior closure factor established by the department based upon the most current edition of the Whitestone Building Maintenance and Repair Cost Reference Index and added to the total amount determined for the district under paragraph (c)(viii) of this section. This paragraph shall not apply to any school year during which the building or facility is reopened and becomes operational for purposes of delivering the required educational program within the district or to any school year during which the building or facility is used to provide certified child care, developmental preschool or cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section;\n\n(v) Multiply the adjusted square footage amount for each district's educational buildings determined under paragraph (c)(iii) of this section and the amount determined under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section for all remaining building categories of that district, times a replacement value cost factor established for each building category by the department computed using data from August 1 of the prior school year based upon the median estimate in the most current edition of a nationally recognized, quarterly published construction cost index that provides cost indices for elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, offices and warehouses by city or town, as modified to reflect current Wyoming construction costs determined by the department of administration and information, division of economic analysis;\n\n(vi) Multiply the amount computed under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the adjusted square footage of the district's educational buildings times two and one-half percent (2.5%) for school year 2001-2002, three percent (3%) for school year 2002-2003, and by two percent (2%) for school year 2003-2004 and each school year thereafter;\n\n(vii) Multiply the sum of the amounts obtained under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the building categories identified under subparagraphs (c)(ii)(A) and (D) of this section times two and one-half percent (2.5%) for school year 2001-2002, three percent (3%) for school year 2002-2003, and by two percent (2%) for school year 2003-2004 and each school year thereafter, adjusted as follows:\n\n(A) Determine the proportion that the sum of the square footage for these building categories within the district bears to the educational building square footage computed under subparagraph (c)(ii)(C) of this section, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(iii) of this section, excluding any square footage included under paragraph (c)(iv) of this section;\n\n(B) If the proportion is ten percent (10%) or less, the district is entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;\n\n(C) If the proportion is greater than ten percent (10%) but less than sixteen percent (16%), the district is entitled to ninety percent (90%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;\n\n(D) If the proportion is sixteen percent (16%) or greater but less than twenty-one percent (21%), the district is entitled to eighty percent (80%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;\n\n(E) If the proportion is twenty-one percent (21%) or greater, the district is entitled to seventy percent (70%) of the amount computed under this paragraph.\n\n(viii) Total the amounts computed under paragraphs (c)(iv), (vi) and (vii) of this section.\n\n(d) Repealed By Laws 2004, Chapter 114, 2.\n\n(e) Amounts distributed under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited by the recipient district into a separate account, the balance of which may accumulate from year-to-year. Except as specified under subsection (f) of this section, expenditures from the separate account, including any interest earnings on the account, shall be restricted to expenses incurred for major building and facility repair and replacement as defined in subsection (a) of this section and shall be in accordance with the district's facility plan under W.S. 21-15-116. Account expenditures may include the expenses of district personnel performing work described under paragraph (a)(iii) of this section if approved by the department and if documented within the district's facility plan. The district's facility plan shall clearly specify proposed major maintenance expenditures for addressing district major building and facility repair and replacement needs on a building-by-building basis, updated for the applicable reporting period, which shall be aligned to the statewide adequacy standards and prioritized based upon the impact of the building or facility on the district's ability to deliver the required educational program. The district shall include plans for maintaining any district building or facility which is under a lease agreement, specifying lease revenues available to the district for maintenance of facilities to the level required by statewide adequacy standards. No expenditures shall be made from the separate account unless the repair or replacement of the building or facility systems for which the expenditure is to be made is clearly specified within the district's facility plan or otherwise approved by the department. In a manner and form required by commission rule and regulation, each district shall annually report to the department on the expenditures made from the separate account during the applicable reporting period, separating account expenditures on a building-by-building basis. The department shall annually review account expenditures and shall report expenditures to the commission and the select committee on school facilities established under W.S. 28-11-301. The department shall compile reported building-by-building expenditure information for each district and the district facility plan and include this information in its annual report to the select committee pursuant to W.S. 21-15-121. If any district expends funds within the separate account for purposes not authorized by this subsection or by rule and regulation of the commission, the payments for that district shall be reduced by the amount of the unauthorized expenditure in the school year following the year in which the expenditure was discovered or the school year in which notification was provided by the department, whichever first occurs.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding subsection (e) of this section, a district may expend up to ten percent (10%) of the amount distributed during any school year under subsection (b) of this section for major building and facility repair and replacement needs of the district which are not specified in the district's facility plan, including expenditures for maintenance of district enhancements. Expenditures shall be made under this subsection only after the district's building and facility repair and replacement needs specified in its facility plan have been addressed in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and the department has approved the district's proposed expenditures under this subsection. Amounts not expended for purposes of this subsection during any school year may be accumulated by a district and earmarked within the separate account established under subsection (e) of this section for expenditure under this subsection in subsequent school years, provided the unexpended amount during any school year to be accumulated does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount distributed to the district under subsection (b) of this section for that school year. Each district shall include expenditures under this subsection and any amounts accumulated from year-to-year under this subsection within the annual report required under subsection (e) of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit or limit the application of subparagraph (c)(i)(D) of this section in computing a district's building and facility gross square footage for purposes of determining payment amounts under this section. If any school district exceeds expenditure limitations prescribed by this subsection or fails to comply with expenditure levels for facility adequacy needs identified within its facility plan, the payments for that district in the immediately succeeding year shall be reduced by the excess expenditure amount including any excess expenditure of amounts accumulated under this subsection.",
