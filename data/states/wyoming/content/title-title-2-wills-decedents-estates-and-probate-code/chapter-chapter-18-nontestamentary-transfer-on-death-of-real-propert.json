      "text": "2-18-103. Transfer on death deed.\n\n(a) A deed that conveys an interest in real property, including any debt secured by a lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the owner transfers the deceased owner's interest to the grantee beneficiary designated by name in the transfer on death deed effective on the death of the owner, subject to all conveyances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the owner was subject during the owner's lifetime. The grantee beneficiary also takes title subject to any interest in the property of which the grantee beneficiary has either actual or constructive notice.\n\n(b) A transfer on death deed may designate multiple grantees who take title as joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants in common, or any other tenancy that is valid under the laws of this state.\n\n(c) A transfer on death deed may designate a successor grantee beneficiary. If the transfer on death deed designates a successor grantee beneficiary, the deed must state the condition on which the interest of the successor grantee beneficiary would vest.\n\n(d) If real property is owned by persons as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, a deed that conveys an interest in the real property to a grantee beneficiary designated by all of the then surviving owners and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the last surviving owner transfers the interest to the designated grantee beneficiary effective on the death of the last surviving owner. If a transfer on death deed is executed by fewer than all of the owners of real property owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the transfer on death deed is valid if the last surviving owner is one of the persons who executes the transfer on death deed. If the last surviving owner did not execute the transfer on death deed, the transfer lapses and the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is not affected by the execution of a transfer on death deed that is executed by fewer than all of the owners of the real property, and the rights of a surviving joint tenant with right of survivorship prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a transfer on death deed.\n\n(e) A transfer on death deed is valid only if the deed is executed and recorded, as provided by law, in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the real property is situated, before the death of the owner or the last surviving owner. A transfer on death deed may be used to transfer an interest in real property to the trustee of a trust even if the trust is revocable.\n\n(f) A transfer on death deed may be revoked at any time by the owner or, if there is more than one (1) owner, by any of the owners who executed the transfer on death deed. To be effective, the revocation must be executed and recorded, as provided by law, in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the real property is situated, before the death of the owner who executes the revocation. If the real property is owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship and if the revocation is not executed by all the owners who executed the transfer on death deed, the revocation is not effective unless executed by the last surviving owner.\n\n(g) If an individual who is a recipient of medical assistance for which it would be permissible for the department of health to file a claim pursuant to W.S. 42-4-206 or to assert a lien pursuant to W.S. 42-4-207 conveys an interest in real property by means of a transfer on death deed, the department of health may assert a lien against the property that is the subject of the transfer on death deed for the amount which would have been recoverable against the owner's estate pursuant to W.S. 42-4-206 and may file a lien against the property pursuant to W.S. 42-4-207.\n\n(h) If an owner executes and records more than one (1) transfer on death deed concerning the same real property, the last transfer on death deed that is recorded before the owner's death is the effective transfer on death deed.\n\n(j) This section does not prohibit other methods of conveying property that are permitted by law and that have the effect of postponing enjoyment of an interest in real property until the death of the owner. This section does not invalidate any deed otherwise effective by law to convey title to the interests and estates provided in the deed that is not recorded until after the death of the owner.\n\n(k) The signature, consent, or agreement of, or notice to, a grantee beneficiary of a transfer on death deed is not required for any purpose during the lifetime of the owner.\n\n(m) A transfer on death deed that is executed, acknowledged, and recorded in accordance with this section is not revoked by the provisions of a will.\n\n(n) Proof of the death of the owner or a grantee beneficiary and transfer of ownership of the property by operation of law shall be established exclusively as follows:\n\n(i) By recording an affidavit as provided under W.S. 34-11-101 and an accompanying certificate of clearance;\n\n(ii) The affidavit and accompanying certificate of clearance shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real property is situated. The affidavit shall identify the transfer on death deed by deed book and page or document number. The certificate of clearance shall be issued by the Wyoming department of health and shall certify that all medical assistance claims have either been satisfied or do not exist.\n\n(o) Title to the interest in real property transferred by a transfer on death deed shall vest in the designated grantee beneficiary only on the death of the owner. Insurance coverage applicable to a property that is in force at the time of the death of the last titled owner shall be transferred and extended to the designated grantee beneficiary in accordance with W.S. 26-23-109 for a period of up to sixty (60) days following the date of the death of the last owner, unless the grantee beneficiary has disclaimed interest in the real property.",
