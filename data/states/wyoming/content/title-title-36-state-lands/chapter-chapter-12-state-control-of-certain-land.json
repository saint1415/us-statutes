Legislative determinations.\n\n(a) The legislature determines:\n\n(i) The intent of the framers of the constitution of the United States was to guarantee to each of the states sovereignty over all matters within its boundaries except for those powers specifically granted to the United States as agent of the states;\n\n(ii) The attempted imposition upon the state of Wyoming by the congress of the United States of a requirement in the Statehood Act that the state of Wyoming and its people \"disclaim all right and title to any lands or other property not granted or confirmed to the state or its political subdivisions by or under the authority of this act, the right or title to which is held by the United States or is subject to disposition by the United States\", as a condition precedent to acceptance of Wyoming into the Union, was an act beyond the power of the congress of the United States and is thus void;\n\n(iii) The purported right of ownership and control of the unappropriated public land in the state of Wyoming by the United States is without foundation and violates the clear intent of the constitution of the United States; and\n\n(iv) The exercise of that dominion and control of the public land in the state of Wyoming by the United States works a severe, continuous and debilitating hardship upon the people of the state of Wyoming.",
