Any hearing on appeal provided for herein in the district court shall be de novo, and the district court shall consider not only the question of procedure but also the merits of the point or points appealed from, including but not limited to eminent domain proceedings. Any appeal from a decision of the district court shall follow the usual rules of civil procedure.\n\n(b) If no appeal is taken within the time prescribed in this section from such order or resolution of the board of directors accepting the report of the appraisers, or after the finding of the court in case an appeal is taken from such order or resolution of the board of directors, then such assessments shall be final and conclusive and shall constitute perpetual liens upon the land so assessed until they are fully paid.",
