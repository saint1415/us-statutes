Packets shall be mailed not sooner than forty-five (45) days and not later than forty (40) days before an election for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122(h) unless the court order provides otherwise;\n\n(ii) The ballot shall contain the following warning:\n\nThe criminal laws regulating the conduct of elections contained in chapter 26 of the Wyoming Election Code of 1973, as amended, apply with equal force to elections by mail.\n\n(iii) Not sooner than twenty-one (21) days and before 7:00 p.m. on election day for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122, mail ballots shall be made available at the election official's office for voters entitled to vote in the election but whose address has changed or who did not receive their ballot in the mail;\n\n(iv) A voter may obtain a replacement ballot if the ballot was destroyed, spoiled, lost or for some other reason not received by the voter. In order to obtain a replacement ballot, the voter shall sign a sworn statement specifying the reason for requesting the replacement ballot. The statement shall be presented to the election official no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day. The election official shall keep a record of each replacement ballot issued in accordance with this paragraph. A replacement ballot may be transmitted directly to the applicant at the election official's office or may be mailed to the voter at the address provided in the application. Replacement ballots may be cast no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;\n\n(v) Upon receipt of a ballot, the voter shall mark the ballot, sign and complete the return-verification envelope and comply with the instructions provided with the ballot. The voter may return the marked ballot to the election official by United States mail or by depositing the ballot at the office of the election official or the designated depository no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;\n\n(vi) Once the ballot is returned, it shall not be returned to the voter. The election official shall first qualify the submitted ballot by examining the verification envelope and comparing the information on the envelope to the poll list to determine whether the ballot was submitted by a voter who has not previously voted in the election. If the ballot so qualifies and is otherwise valid, the official shall place a number next to the voter's name in the poll book. The election official shall then open and separate the ballot from the envelope and place the ballot in a ballot box so as to keep the voter's ballot private;\n\n(vii) All deposited ballots shall be counted as provided in this act and rules promulgated by the secretary of state. A special mail ballot shall be valid and counted only if is returned in the return-verification envelope, the affidavit on the envelope is signed by the voter to whom the ballot was issued and the information on the envelope is verified as provided in paragraph (vi) of this subsection. If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall only count the first ballot received from that voter;\n\n(viii) The election official shall provide a minimum of one (1) polling place on the day of election which may be the election official's office and shall be open between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.\n\n(c) If any special mail ballot packet mailed under paragraph (b)(i) of this section to a physical address, not including a post office box, is returned by the postal service, the county clerk shall investigate the validity of the address. If the county clerk determines that the address is not at a location that a voter could inhabit, the county clerk shall remove the address from the registration records until the county clerk receives proof that the address is habitable by a voter.",
