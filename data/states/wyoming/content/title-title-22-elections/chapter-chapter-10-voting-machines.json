The political party representatives and representatives of independent candidates may be present at the preparation of the voting machine for the election, to see that the machine is tested for accuracy and is properly prepared and that all registering counters are set at zero (00000). The county clerk in the presence of these representatives shall prepare the voting machine for the election and set all registering counters at zero (00000). He shall then test each registering counter for accuracy by casting votes on it until the registering counter is correctly registering each vote cast on it. The county clerk shall then reset each registering counter to zero (00000) and shall immediately lock and seal the voting machine with a numbered metal seal and make a record of the number of the seal on the certificate for the machine. The seal shall be so placed as to prevent operation of the machine or its registering counters without breaking the seal. The county clerk shall then immediately make a record on the certificate for the machine of the reading shown on the protective counter.\n\n(b) Inspection of voting machines may begin two (2) weeks before an election and continue until all machines to be used are sealed. Immediately following testing of a machine, the county clerk shall make a certificate in writing stating the serial number of each machine, whether the machine has all the registering counters set at zero (00000), and whether the machine has been tested by voting on each registering counter to prove that each registering counter is in perfect and accurate condition, the number registered on the protective counter, and the number on the seal with which the machine is sealed against operation. This certificate shall be kept on file in the office of the county clerk.",
