Desertion generally; penalty; public welfare funds; prisoner's earnings; temporary order for support.\n\n(a) Any spouse who, without just cause or lawful excuse, deserts the other spouse or fails or refuses to provide adequately for the support and maintenance of the other spouse and who at the time of leaving, failure or refusal is or thereafter becomes in necessitous circumstances is guilty of a crime, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.\n\n(b) Any person who without just cause or legal excuse intentionally fails, refuses or neglects to provide adequate support which the person knows or reasonably should know the person is legally obligated to provide to a child under eighteen (18) years of age is guilty of:\n\n(i) A misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), or both;\n\n(ii) A misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not less than seven (7) days nor more than one (1) year, a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or both, if:\n\n(A) The defendant has previously been convicted under this subsection; or\n\n(B) The support has been ordered by any court and the defendant has failed to pay the support obligation within sixty (60) days after the date payment was due.\n\n(c) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (a) or (b) of this section that the person was unable to provide adequate support but did provide such support as was within that person's ability and means. A person may not demonstrate inability to provide support if the person is employable but, without reasonable excuse, fails diligently to seek employment, terminates employment or reduces earnings or assets. A person who raises an affirmative defense has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(d) Support of spouse or child by public welfare funds or from any source other than from the other spouse or parent as the case may be, is not just cause or lawful excuse for the spouse or parent to fail to provide support under this section.\n\n(e) Repealed By Laws 2014, Ch. 117, 2.\n\n(f) Proceedings under this section may be instituted upon verified complaint against any person guilty of the offenses.\n\n(g) At any time before trial, upon petition of the complainant and notice to the defendant, the court may enter a temporary order providing for the support of the deserted spouse or children or both, pendente lite, and may punish for violation of the order as for contempt.\n\n(h) This state has jurisdiction over an offense under this section if conduct constituting any element of the offense or a result of that conduct occurs within this state.",

Ordering of payments for support in lieu of penalty; when authorized; term; release of defendant on probation; entering of recognizance; conditions of recognizance; providing for security.\n\n(a) Before trial with the consent of the defendant, or on entry of a plea of guilty or after conviction, instead of the penalty provided by W.S. 20-3-101(b) or in addition thereto, the court having regard to the circumstances and the financial ability or earning capacity of the defendant, may enter an order directing the defendant to pay a certain sum for not exceeding two (2) years, to the parent, the guardian or custodian of the minor child or children or to an organization or individual approved by the court as trustee. The court may release the defendant on probation for the period so fixed, upon a recognizance with or without surety in an amount as the court may order, conditioned that if the defendant appears in court whenever ordered and complies with the terms of the order of support or any modification thereof, the recognizance shall be void.\n\n(b) The court may require the defendant to provide any security of nonexempt property that the court deems satisfactory to secure the obligation to pay child support.\n\n(c) The court, upon petition and following notice and hearing, shall no longer require the order for security if the court determines:\n\n(i) Good cause no longer exists to require security to assure payment upon the obligation to pay child support; and\n\n(ii) There is no overdue support outstanding.\n\n(d) Once the obligor has satisfied the obligation to make child support payments as ordered by the court, the security shall be released.",

Proving marriage, parenthood; spouses as witnesses; disclosure of confidential communications; desertion, neglect or refusal to support.\n\nNo other or greater evidence is required to prove the marriage of a husband and wife or that the defendant is the father or mother of a child or children than is required to prove such facts in a civil action. In a prosecution under this act no statute or rule of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between husband and wife shall apply. Both husband and wife are competent witnesses to testify against each other to any relevant matters including the fact of marriage and the parentage of the child or children but neither shall be compelled to give evidence incriminating himself or herself. Proof of the desertion of the wife, child or children in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or of the neglect or refusal to provide for the support and maintenance of the wife, child or children is prima facie evidence that the desertion, neglect or refusal is willful.",
