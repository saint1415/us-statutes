If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.\n\n(g) If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection (a) of this section for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses.",
