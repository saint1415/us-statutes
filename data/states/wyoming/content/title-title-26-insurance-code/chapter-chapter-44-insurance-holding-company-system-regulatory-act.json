Subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.\n\n(b) In addition to investments in common stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under all other sections of this chapter, a domestic insurer may also:\n\n(i) Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent (10%) of the insurer's assets or fifty percent (50%) of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after the investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of the investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries and health maintenance organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included:\n\n(A) Total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and\n\n(B) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.\n\n(ii) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph (i) of this subsection or in W.S. 26-7-102 through 26-7-116 applicable to the insurer. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"the total investment of the insurer\" shall include:\n\n(A) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and\n\n(B) The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary.\n\n(iii) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries, provided that after the investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.\n\n(c) Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section meets the applicable requirements is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.\n\n(d) If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in the subsidiary made pursuant to this section within three (3) years from the time of the cessation of control or within any further time the commissioner may prescribe, unless the investment meets the requirements for investment under any other section of this title and the insurer so notifies the commissioner.",

The transactions to be considered are:\n\n(i) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees or investments if on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent (25%) of surplus as regards policyholders;\n\n(B) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets.\n\n(ii) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes the loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit if on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent (25%) of surplus as regards policyholders;\n\n(B) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets.\n\n(iii) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including all reinsurance pooling agreements, agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three (3) years, equals or exceeds five percent (5%) of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one (1) or more affiliates of the insurer;\n\n(iv) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and\n\n(v) Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transaction which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\n(d) A domestic insurer shall not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the notification requirement set forth in subsection (b) of this section and thus the review that would otherwise occur. If the commissioner determines that separate transactions were entered into over any twelve (12) month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his authority under W.S. 26-44-113.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall be notified within thirty (30) days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one (1) corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent (10%) of the corporation's voting securities.",

The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in Wyoming. However, the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.

However, the commissioner shall make a determination or acknowledgement under subsection (c) or (d) of this section as to the appropriate group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group if a material change in the internationally active insurance group results in either of the following:\n\n(i) The internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in Wyoming holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets or liabilities;\n\n(ii) Wyoming being the place of domicile of the top tiered insurer in the internationally active insurance group's insurance holding company system.\n\n(f) Pursuant to W.S. 26-44-109, the commissioner may collect from any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104 all information necessary to determine whether the commissioner may act as the group wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the commissioner may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group wide supervisor.

The agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in Wyoming is doing business in Wyoming or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Wyoming;\n\n(vi) Conduct any other group wide supervision activities consistent with this section as deemed necessary by the commissioner.\n\n(j) If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the NAIC is the group wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a supervisory college or otherwise with group wide supervision undertaken by the group wide supervisor, provided that:\n\n(i) The commissioner's cooperation complies with the laws of Wyoming; and\n\n(ii) The regulatory official acknowledged as the group wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities as a group wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups as applicable. Where the recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may refuse recognition and cooperation.\n\n(k) The commissioner may enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104, any affiliate of the insurer or any other state, federal or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group wide supervisor.\n\n(m) A registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in the administration of this section, including the costs to engage attorneys, actuaries or other professionals and all reasonable travel costs.",
