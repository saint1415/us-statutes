This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one (1) ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.\n\n(c) If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section, but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to W.S. 26-51-105 shall be the report applicable to that insurer.\n\n(d) An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure and any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one (1) state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section:\n\n(i) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests and international supervisor requests;\n\n(ii) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report if the insurer has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in W.S. 26-48-103 and 26-48-203, meets one (1) or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in W.S. 26-3-116, or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(f) If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subsection (a) of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one (1) year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this chapter.",
