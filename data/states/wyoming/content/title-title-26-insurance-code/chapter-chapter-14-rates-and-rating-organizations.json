      "text": "26-14-103. Definitions.\n\n(a) As used in this chapter:\n\n(i) \"Advisory organization\" means any person or organization which assists insurers as authorized by W.S. 26-14-110. It does not include joint underwriting organizations, actuarial or legal consultants, a single insurer, any employees of an insurer or insurers under common control or management of their employees or managers;\n\n(ii) \"Competitive market\" means any market except those which are noncompetitive pursuant to this chapter;\n\n(iii) \"Excessive\" means a rate that is likely to produce a long-term profit that is unreasonably high for the insurance provided. In a competitive market rates shall not be considered excessive;\n\n(iv) \"Inadequate\" means a rate which is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the continued use of which endangers the solvency of the insurer using it or will have the effect of substantially lessening competition or creating a monopoly in any market;\n\n(v) \"Joint underwriting\" means an arrangement established to provide insurance coverage for a risk, pursuant to which two (2) or more insurers contract with the insured for a price and policy terms agreed upon between or among the insurers;\n\n(vi) \"Market\" means the statewide interaction between buyers and sellers in the procurement of a line of insurance coverage pursuant to the provisions of this chapter;\n\n(vii) \"Noncompetitive market\" means:\n\n(A) Residual markets;\n\n(C) Credit property insurance, including vendors' single interest physical damage insurance where the buyer pays a separate charge for insurance; or\n\n(D) Any market in which:\n\n(I) There are less than five (5) insurers actually issuing a particular line of insurance as determined by the commissioner;\n\n(II) Three (3) insurers transact more than ninety percent (90%) of the business;\n\n(III) Two (2) insurers transact more than eighty percent (80%) of the business; or\n\n(IV) There is reasonable evidence, as determined by the commissioner, of collusion among insurers in setting prices.\n\n(viii) \"Pool\" means an arrangement pursuant to which two (2) or more insurers participate in the sharing of risks on a predetermined basis. A pool may operate as an association, syndicate or in any other generally recognized manner;\n\n(ix) \"Residual market mechanism\" means an arrangement, either voluntary or mandated by law, involving participation by insurers in the equitable apportionment of risks among insurers for insurance which may be afforded applicants who are unable to obtain insurance through ordinary methods;\n\n(x) \"Supplementary rate information\" means any manual or plan of rates, classification, rating schedule, minimum premium, policy fee, rating rule and any other similar information needed to determine an applicable rate in effect or to be in effect;\n\n(xi) \"Supporting information\" means the experience and judgment of the filer and the experience or data of other insurers or organizations relied upon by the filer, the interpretation of any statistical data relied upon by the filer, a description of methods used in making the rates and other similar information relied upon by the filer;\n\n(xii) \"Unfairly discriminatory\" refers to rates that cannot be actuarially justified. It does not refer to rates that produce differences in premiums for policyholders with like loss exposures but different expenses, or like expenses but different loss exposures, so long as the rate reflects such differences with reasonable accuracy. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory if it averages broadly among persons insured under a group, franchise or blanket policy or a mass marketing plan. No rate in a competitive market shall be considered unfairly discriminatory unless it violates the provisions of W.S. 26-14-105(b) in that they classify in whole or in part on the basis of race, color, creed or national origin.",

In determining whether rates in a noncompetitive market are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, consideration may be given to the following elements:\n\n(i) Basic Rate Factors.-Consideration may be given to past and prospective loss and expense experience within and outside of this state, to catastrophe hazards and contingencies, to events or trends within and outside of this state, to dividends or savings to policyholders, members or subscribers and to all other factors and judgments deemed relevant by the insurer;\n\n(ii) Classification.-Rates may be modified for individual risks in accordance with rating plans or schedules which establish standards for measuring probable variations in hazards or expenses, or both;\n\n(iii) Expenses.-The expense provisions shall reflect the operating methods of the insurer and, so far as credible, its own actual and anticipated expense experience; and\n\n(iv) Contingencies and Profits.-The rates may contain a provision for contingencies and a provision for a reasonable underwriting profit, and shall reflect investment income directly attributable to unearned premium and loss reserves.\n\n(c) Repealed by Laws 2021, ch. 138, 1.",

Rate regulation.\n\n(a) Rates in a noncompetitive market, when regulated, shall be regulated in accordance with W.S. 26-14-105 through 26-14-108 applicable to noncompetitive markets.\n\n(b) The commissioner may regulate rates in an unregulated market if he determines that:\n\n(i) The unregulated market is a noncompetitive market; and\n\n(ii) Regulation will likely reduce rates for consumers in a total amount greater than the cost of regulation without substantially curtailing the availability of insurance in that market.\n\n(c) The commissioner may declare a noncompetitive market competitive if he determines the noncompetitive market no longer meets the conditions of a noncompetitive market as defined in W.S. 26-14-103(a)(vii).\n\n(d) To carry out the purpose of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the commissioner, upon his own motion, may conduct a rate or other investigation. The commissioner shall conduct a rate or other investigation upon request of:\n\n(i) Not less than ten percent (10%) of the insureds in any market;\n\n(ii) Any organization representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the insureds in any market; or\n\n(iii) Insurers selling at least thirty percent (30%) of the insurance in any market.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall not be compelled to conduct an investigation of any line of insurance pursuant to subsection (d) of this section more than once in any three (3) year period for any line of insurance but may do so.\n\n(f) As a part of any investigation under subsection (d) of this section the commissioner:\n\n(i) May require any insurer to submit actuarial and expense data relating to any line of insurance;\n\n(ii) May contract the services of an actuarial consultant and assess the cost thereof against the parties requesting the investigation or against the insurers affected if the investigation is conducted upon the commissioner's motion;\n\n(iii) Shall conduct a hearing upon not less than twenty (20) days written notice to affected parties, provided this requirement may be waived upon written agreement of the affected parties;\n\n(iv) Depending upon the availability of data and the existence of sufficient experience to allow for an actuarially sound determination, may base any regulation of rates for any line of insurance under this section on experience or loss data for that line of insurance in:\n\n(A) Wyoming alone;\n\n(B) Wyoming and selected other states with reasonably similar characteristics; or\n\n(C) The United States as a whole excluding states whose experience is atypical.\n\n(g) For rates regulated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, there shall be a public hearing if within any twelve (12) month period an insurer requests approval of a base premium rate which when added to any other base premium rates pending or approved within that twelve (12) month period is twenty percent (20%) or more above the rate approved for the previous rating period. For health care professional malpractice insurance, a rate increase of more than twenty-five percent (25%) in any specialty shall cause a consolidated hearing on the rate increase. The informational hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days of the request for approval unless the commissioner delays the hearing for good cause. If the hearing is delayed the commissioner shall notify the insurer and any other person requesting notification of the reasons for the delay.\n\n(h) The following shall apply to any market found to be noncompetitive pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section and to any professional liability insurance for any health care provider licensed under title 33 of the Wyoming statutes:\n\n(i) The rate charged any individual insured shall not exceed the base rate approved by the commissioner for the insured's risk class by more than one hundred percent (100%), unless the commissioner has established for the applicable risk class a percentage limit of less than one hundred percent (100%);\n\n(ii) The rate charged an insured for extended reporting coverage following expiration, termination or nonrenewal of the insured's claims-made policy shall be subject to the following:\n\n(A) The rate shall be calculated according to a formula set forth in the insured's policy, which formula shall be subject to approval by the commissioner;\n\n(B) The formula shall be expressed as a percentage of the base rate for the insured's risk class or that insured's underwritten rate;\n\n(C) The percentage may be varied on a uniform basis for each risk class by the length of time during which the events covered by the extended reporting coverage may have arisen; and\n\n(D) If an individual elects to purchase the extended reporting coverage before the renewal date of his policy, the rates charged for the extended reporting coverage shall be computed based on the relevant rates for that insured before the renewal, not the rates that would be in effect upon renewal.",
