The commissioner may consider the factors specified in W.S. 26-3-116(c) and 26-3-132(a) when making this finding.\n\n(b) In addition to or in lieu of suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority pursuant to this section, the applicant or health maintenance organization may be subjected to an administrative penalty of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each cause for suspension or revocation.\n\n(c) Whenever the commissioner finds that the net worth maintained by any health maintenance organization subject to the provisions of this act is less than the minimum net worth required to be maintained by W.S. 26-34-114, he shall give written notice to the health maintenance organization of the amount of the deficiency and require:\n\n(i) Filing with the commissioner a plan for correction of the deficiency acceptable to the commissioner; and\n\n(ii) Correction of the deficiency within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, unless an extension of time, not to exceed sixty (60) additional days, is granted by the commissioner.\n\n(d) A deficiency shall be deemed an impairment, and failure to correct the impairment in the prescribed time shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority or for placing the health maintenance organization in conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation.\n\n(e) Unless allowed by the commissioner, no health maintenance organization or person acting on its behalf may, directly or indirectly, renew, issue or deliver any certificate, agreement or contract of coverage in this state, for which a premium is charged or collected, when the health maintenance organization writing the coverage is impaired, and the impairment is known to the health maintenance organization or to the person. However, the existence of an impairment shall not prevent the issuance or renewal of a certificate, agreement or contract when the enrollee exercises an option granted under the plan to obtain a new, renewed or converted coverage.\n\n(f) A certificate of authority shall be suspended or revoked, or an administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, only after compliance with W.S. 26-34-125.\n\n(g) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization, during the period of suspension, shall not enroll any additional enrollees except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation of any kind.\n\n(h) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, that organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, to wind up its affairs, and shall conduct no further business except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of its affairs. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind. The commissioner, by written order, may permit any further operation of the organization as he finds to be in the best interest of enrollees, to the end that enrollees are afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.",
