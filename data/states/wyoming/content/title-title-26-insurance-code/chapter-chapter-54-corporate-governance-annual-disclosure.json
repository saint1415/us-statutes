Notwithstanding any request from the commissioner made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state and under the guidance of the procedures outlined in the most recent financial analysis handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n(b) The CGAD shall include a signature of the insurer's or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices disclosed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.\n\n(c) An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the commissioner's request.\n\n(d) For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level or the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three (3) criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting.\n\n(e) The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state under the guidance of the procedures contained in the most recent financial analysis handbook referenced in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(f) Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this act in other documents provided to the commissioner, including any statements filed pursuant to W.S. 26-44-104, or other state or federal filings provided to the department, shall not be required to duplicate that information in the CGAD, but shall be required to cross reference and identify where the document may be located by the commissioner.",
