Effects of redomestication.\n\n(a) The certificate of authority, agent appointments and licenses, rates, and other items which the commissioner of insurance allows, in his discretion, which are in existence at the time any insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in this state transfers its corporate domicile to this or any other state by merger, consolidation, continuance, transfer or any other lawful method shall continue in full force and effect upon the transfer if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in this state. All outstanding policies of any transferring insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new name of the company or its new location unless so ordered by the commissioner. Every transferring insurer shall file new policy forms with the commissioner on or before the effective date of the transfer, but may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements if allowed by, and under conditions approved by, the commissioner.\n\n(b) The procedures for filing and approval of articles of domestication by the corporate directors shall be the same as those set forth in W.S. 26-24-104 concerning the filing and approval of articles of incorporation for proposed domestic insurers.\n\n(c) The articles of domestication of any insurer transferring its domicile into this state shall be deemed the articles of incorporation of the insurer. The domestication of an insurer into this state shall have the same effect upon the insurer as in the case of a corporation continuing in Wyoming pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1810.",
