The contract shall be subject to the following requirements:\n\n(i) A domestic controlled insurer shall file the contract with, and obtain the approval of, the commissioner prior to the effective date of the contract and in accordance with W.S. 26-15-110(b) and 26-15-111. In all other cases the insurer shall file the contract, or any amendment to a contract, with the commissioner within fifteen (15) days after it has been signed;\n\n(ii) The contract shall specify the responsibilities of each party and contain the following minimum provisions:\n\n(A) The controlled insurer may terminate the contract for cause upon written notice to the controlling broker. The controlled insurer shall suspend the authority of the controlling broker to write business during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for the termination;\n\n(B) The controlling broker shall render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges and other fees received by, or owing to, the controlling broker;\n\n(C) The controlling broker shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the controlled insurer on at least a monthly basis.
