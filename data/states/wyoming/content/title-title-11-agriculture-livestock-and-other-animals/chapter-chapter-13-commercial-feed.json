In cases not covered by such methods, or in cases where methods are available in which improved applicability has been demonstrated, the director may adopt such appropriate methods from other sources. The director, in determining whether a commercial feed is deficient in any component, shall be guided solely by the official sample analyzed in accordance with the methods so adopted. A deficiency in an official sample of commercial feed resulting from nonuniformity during packaging is deemed to be a deficiency for the purposes of this act. For purposes of this act, the results of official analysis shall be final, unless it is determined by the director that a resample is warranted. If a distributor or registrant requests a resample of a commercial feed based upon the director's findings of a deficiency, all costs associated with the resampling and analysis shall be borne by the distributor or registrant. If the results of the resampling establish the result of the first analysis was invalid, the department shall bear the costs associated with the resampling. Any requests for a resample to the director shall be made in writing.\n\n(c) When the inspection and analysis of an official sample indicates a commercial feed has been adulterated or misbranded, the results of analysis shall be forwarded by the director to the distributor and the purchaser.

All provisions for enforcement of items found to be short weight shall be administered by the department under W.S. 40-10-117 through 40-10-136 of the Wyoming weights and measures law.\n\n(ii) A commercial feed shall be deemed to be adulterated if:\n\n(A) It bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health, but in case the substance is not an added substance, such commercial feeds shall not be considered adulterated under this subsection if the quantity of such substance does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;\n\n(B) It contains an unapproved food and drug administration drug, medication or animal remedy;\n\n(C) Any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom or any less valuable substance substituted therefor;\n\n(D) It contains any prohibited noxious weed seeds or exceeds the tolerance established on restricted noxious weed seeds pursuant to W.S. 11-12-104 or exceeds two percent (2%) of viable common weed seeds by weight.",

This statement is a warning only, to the distributor that if the article is distributed further the director may bring proceedings.
