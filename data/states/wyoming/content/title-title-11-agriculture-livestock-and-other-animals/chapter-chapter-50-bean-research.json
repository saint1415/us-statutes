Interest earned on monies in the account shall be deposited to the credit of the account. All monies in the account including earned interest shall be expended only for the purposes authorized by this act.\n\n(b) Assessments collected by department under this section shall be deposited with the state treasurer to the credit of the account created by subsection (a) of this section. Monies received by the commission under this subsection shall be used to administer this act.\n\n(c) The commission shall at the end of each quarter reimburse the department for collection and administrative costs incurred by the department in collecting the assessment under subsection (b) of this section. The amount reimbursed shall equal one percent (1%) of the assessments collected during the quarter and shall be deposited with the state treasurer.\n\n(d) The amount of the assessment collected under this section shall be as follows:\n\n(i) For growers, thirty-four hundredths percent (0.34%) of the value of the settlement to the grower;\n\n(ii) For handlers, seventeen hundredths percent (0.17%) of the value of the settlement to the grower;\n\n(iii) After July 1, 2017, the commission by rule may change the assessment levied under this section provided that the proportion shall be two-thirds (2/3) on the grower and one-third (1/3) on the handler and the total levy shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the value of the settlement to the grower.\n\n(e) The assessment rate as determined under subsection (d) of this section shall be paid by the respective grower and handler who are primarily liable.
