      "text": "11-48-102. Disposition of feral livestock; penalty.\n\n(a) Before any livestock can be declared feral, a reasonable attempt shall be made by the director or the state veterinarian to locate and identify the owner of the livestock and to notify the owner to take possession of the livestock. If the owner repeatedly refuses to take possession of the livestock, he shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(b) If the state veterinarian or the director are unable to identify and notify the owner of the livestock or the owner refused to take possession for the livestock within five (5) days after receiving notice, the livestock may be declared to be feral livestock.\n\n(c) If the director or the state veterinarian determines that any feral livestock are damaging private or public property, including grass, cultivated crops or stored crops, or determines the feral livestock is on private or public property where the feral livestock are not authorized to be and that capturing the feral livestock is not feasible or is cost prohibitive, the director or the state veterinarian may order the disposal of the feral livestock.\n\n(d) If the state veterinarian determines or suspects any feral livestock are likely to be infected with or able to spread any infectious or contagious disease, the state veterinarian may order the destruction of the feral livestock.\n\n(e) There shall be no right for any future indemnity or payment to the owner for the disposition of any feral livestock disposed of in accordance with this section. Should the owner of any feral livestock disposed of in accordance with this section be subsequently identified, the board may seek reimbursement from the owner for all costs associated with the disposal and removal of the feral livestock.\n\n(f) The Wyoming livestock board shall promulgate rules necessary for the administration of this section.\n\n(g) The owner of feral livestock shall be:\n\n(i) Responsible for all damages caused by the feral livestock; and\n\n(ii) Responsible for the costs of gathering, feeding, veterinary services, transportation and other incidental expenses relating to the feral livestock incurred by the Wyoming livestock board.\n\n(h) Any person failing to comply with this section shall be punished as provided in W.S. 11-1-103.",
