Taking up estrays; generally.\n\n(a) No person shall take up and retain possession of an estray except in the county where he resides and is a freeholder, nor unless the animal is found on lands owned, leased, or controlled by him or his duly authorized agents. When any person takes up an estray he shall immediately notify an inspector who shall inspect or cause to be inspected the estray for brands and other evidence of ownership and make a diligent effort to learn or determine ownership of the animal. The inspector may cause any estray to be held for not more than ten (10) days after the inspection to enable him to complete his investigation of ownership. If the estray is claimed by an owner, the bill for feed and care incurred by the inspector must be paid by the claimant. If the rightful owner cannot be found, or when found, refuses or fails to pay the charges for feed and care of the estray, the inspector shall order the estray be disposed of. Incurred charges for feed and care by the inspector and reasonable shipping and disposal expense shall be paid from the proceeds of the disposal. The net proceeds, if any, received from the disposal of the estray after deduction of authorized expenses, shall be forwarded to the estray fund of the board or its agency. The board or agency shall hold the proceeds in a special fund known as estray fund until paid to the rightful owner of the estray or otherwise disposed of according to law.\n\n(b) If the proceeds of the disposal of any estray are insufficient to pay all legitimate expenses, the deficiency shall be paid by the board or its agency.\n\n(c) The board may enter into agreements with licensed meat processing plants to process meat from livestock disposed of by slaughter. The processed meat shall be sold to:\n\n(i) Wyoming state institutions or to nonprofit organizations for no more than the board's cost for disposal, processing and delivery; or\n\n(ii) For profit entities at market cost for the processed meat.",

No livestock shall be picketed on an interstate or national defense highway as defined in W.S. 31-18-801(a)(xvi).\n\n(b) Any person or corporation violating this section shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and in addition shall pay all damage done by the livestock.

If ownership is not known, the impounding officer shall report his action to an inspector. The inspector shall make a diligent effort to ascertain ownership of the impounded livestock, and for this purpose may hold the livestock not more than ten (10) days. If unable to determine ownership, the inspector shall dispose of the impounded livestock. Reasonable transportation and disposal expenses shall be paid from the proceeds of the disposal, if any.\n\n(d) A removal fee of not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) per head shall be allowed for the expense incurred in removing livestock from any public highway and an impounding fee for expenses incurred for the feed and care of the animal shall be allowed the person responsible for feed and care of the livestock removed. The inspector is responsible for collection and payment to the rightful claimants of removal and impounding fees when impounded livestock is surrendered to the owner.

The board shall hold the proceeds until paid to the rightful owner of the livestock or otherwise disposed of according to law.\n\n(g) A peace officer may remove, destroy or otherwise dispose of an animal injured on a state highway after a reasonable attempt to locate the owner of a salvageable animal or a game warden in the case of a wild animal. If reasonably possible, the peace officer shall contact the brand inspector before removing, destroying or disposing of livestock. The carcass of an animal killed on a state highway shall be disposed of by highway maintenance crews. If the owner desires, he may claim the carcass from the maintenance crew. The crews shall report to the inspector brands, marks, tags or other identification. The inspector shall endeavor to establish ownership of the animal and notify the owner in writing or notify the local game warden as may be appropriate. Notwithstanding W.S. 24-1-112 and as part of their duties, any peace officer, inspector or other person acting under this section may, but is not obligated to, attempt to repair any fencing through which an animal has gained improper access to the area in which the animal is found.",
