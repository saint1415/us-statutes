The lists shall be reviewed at least annually with the county health officer, the manager of the department of family services field office serving the county, the preschool developmental disability program serving the county and the county or municipal human services agency or coordinator, if any.\n\n(h) Any physician providing prenatal care or delivering a baby where the care or delivery is eligible for reimbursement under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act may, unless contraindicated, refer the expectant mother or the infant to the public health nurse serving the county for placement in the program. Physicians may refer other pregnant women, infants or families to the program as medically needed. The referrals shall begin once the program is operational within the county.",
