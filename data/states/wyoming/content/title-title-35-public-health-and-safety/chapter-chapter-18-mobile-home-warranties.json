The mobile home warranty from the manufacturer or dealer to the buyer shall be set forth in a separate written document entitled \"mobile home warranty\", shall be delivered to the buyer by the dealer or manufacturer before the time the contract of sale is signed, and shall contain, but is not limited to, the following terms:\n\n(i) The mobile home meets federal mobile home construction and safety standards and those standards prescribed by law or administrative rule, if any, of the mobile homes council, which are in effect at the time of its manufacture;\n\n(ii) The mobile home is free from defects if it receives reasonable care and maintenance;\n\n(iii) The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall take corrective action for defects for which the mobile home owner has given notice to the manufacturer or dealer not later than one (1) year after the delivery date. The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall make the appropriate adjustments and repairs, within sixty (60) days after notification of the defect, at the site of the mobile home without charge to the mobile home owner, provided, however, that neither manufacturer nor dealer shall be liable for any defect in the mobile home which is the result of improper setup, move, materials furnished or work done by persons other than manufacturer or dealer unless the work was performed by persons under contract or connected by agency with the manufacturer or dealer;\n\n(iv) The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall take corrective action for any defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard under applicable federal mobile home construction and safety standards for which the mobile home owner has given notice to the manufacturer or dealer. The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall bring the mobile home into compliance with applicable standards and correct the defect or have the defect corrected within a reasonable period of time at the site of the mobile home without charge to the owner, but only if:\n\n(A) The defect presents an unreasonable risk of injury or death to occupants of the affected mobile home; or\n\n(B) The defect is related to an error in design or assembly of the mobile home by the manufacturer.\n\n(v) If a repair, replacement, substitution or alteration is made under the warranty and it is discovered, before or after the expiration of the warranty period, that the repair, replacement, substitution or alteration has not restored the mobile home to the condition in which it was warranted except for reasonable wear and tear, such failure shall be deemed a violation of the warranty and the mobile home shall be restored to the condition in which it was warranted to be at the time of the sale except for reasonable wear and tear, at no cost to the purchaser or his assignees, notwithstanding that the additional repair may occur after the expiration of the warranty period;\n\n(vi) The manufacturer and dealer shall be jointly and severally liable to the buyer for the fulfillment of the terms of warranty, and the buyer may give notice to either one (1) or both of the defect. Notice to either the manufacturer or dealer shall be considered notice to both the manufacturer and dealer. The address and the phone number of where to mail or deliver written notices for both the manufacturer and dealer shall be set forth in the warranty; and\n\n(vii) If during any period of time after notification of a defect the mobile home is unhabitable because of the defect, that period of time shall not be considered part of the one (1) year warranty period.\n\n(b) Any transfer of a mobile home from one (1) owner or lessee to another during the effective period of the warranty does not terminate the warranty, and subsequent owners or lessees shall be entitled to the full protection of the warranty for the duration of the warranty period as if the original owner or lessee had not transferred the mobile home.",
