This finding may be reviewed by the supreme court together with any further action of the district court taken on the petition; or\n\n(iii) The petitioner was represented by the same attorney in the trial and appellate courts.\n\n(c) This act does not apply to claims of error or denial of rights in any proceeding:\n\n(i) For the revocation of probation or parole;\n\n(ii) Provided by statute or court rule for new trial, sentence reduction, sentence correction or other post-verdict motion.\n\n(d) No petition under this act shall be allowed if filed more than five (5) years after the judgment of conviction was entered.",
