The election shall be called, conducted and canvassed as provided for bond elections by the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112, on the first date authorized under W.S. 22-21-103 which is not less than sixty (60) days after the board of directors votes to impose any mill levy that requires the approval of the electors under subsection (b) of this section. In no event shall the tax in a district providing emergency medical services exceed in any one (1) year the amount of four (4) mills on each dollar of assessed valuation of property. The mill levy is effective only if the question is approved by a majority of those voting thereon within the district providing emergency medical services. The cost of any special election under this subsection shall be borne by the board of directors.\n\n(d) If the proposition to authorize a mill levy is approved, the tax shall remain in effect until a petition to discontinue the tax, signed by not less than ten percent (10%) of the voters of the district, is received by the board of county commissioners, at which time the proposal to discontinue the tax shall be submitted to the voters of the district at the expense of the county at the next general election.
