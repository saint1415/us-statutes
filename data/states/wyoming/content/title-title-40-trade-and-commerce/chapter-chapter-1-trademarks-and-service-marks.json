Definitions.\n\n(a) The term \"trademark\" as used in this act means any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a person to identify and distinguish the goods of such person, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.\n\n(b) The term \"service mark\" as used in this act means any word, name, symbol or device or any combination thereof used by a person, to identify and distinguish the services of one (1) person, including a unique service, from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services, even if that source is unknown. Titles, character names used by a person and other distinctive features of radio or television programs may be registered as service marks notwithstanding that they, or the programs, may advertise the goods of the sponsor.\n\n(c) The term \"mark\" as used in this act includes any trademark or service mark entitled to registration under this act whether registered or not.\n\n(d) The term \"person\" and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other party entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this act includes a juristic person as well as a natural person.

For the purposes of this act, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in this state:\n\n(i) On goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or other containers on the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and the goods are sold or transported in commerce in this state; and\n\n(ii) On services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in this state.\n\n(h) A mark shall be deemed to be \"abandoned\" under this act when either of the following occurs:\n\n(i) When its use has been discontinued with the intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two (2) consecutive years shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment;\n\n(ii) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as a mark.\n\n(j) The term \"dilution\" as used in this act means the lessening of the capacity of a registrant's mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of:\n\n(i) Competition between the parties; or\n\n(ii) Likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception.\n\n(k) The term \"secretary\" as used in this act means the secretary of state or the designee of the secretary charged with the administration of this act.\n\n(m) \"This act\" means W.S. 40-1-101 through 40-1-116.",
