The failure to deliver the equipment shall not be considered a violation of this chapter if the failure is due to prudent and reasonable restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business decision by the supplier to limit the production volume of the equipment;\n\n(v) To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;\n\n(vi) To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the effect of the discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce or injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of the discrimination. Different prices may be charged if:\n\n(A) The differences are due to differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or repair parts;\n\n(B) The supplier can show that the lower price was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor; or\n\n(C) The differences are related to the volume of equipment purchased by dealers.\n\n(vii) To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer, from changing its capital structure, ownership or the means by or through which the dealer finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior notice to the supplier and provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealer and the supplier and imposed on similarly situated dealers and provided the change by the dealer does not result in a change in the person with actual or effective control of a majority of the voting interests of the dealer;\n\n(viii) To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter;\n\n(ix) Require as a condition of renewal or extension of a dealer agreement that the dealer complete substantial renovation to the dealer's place of business or to acquire new or additional space to serve as the dealer's place of business unless the supplier provides:\n\n(A) At least one (1) year written notice of the condition;\n\n(B) All the grounds supporting the condition; and\n\n(C) A reasonable period of time in which to complete the renovation or acquisition after the one (1) year notice period expires.",

      "text": "40-20-119. Reimbursement for warranty work.\n\n(a) If a dealer submits a warranty claim to a supplier while the dealer agreement is in effect or within sixty (60) days after the termination of the dealer agreement and if the claim is for work performed before the termination or expiration of the dealer agreement, the supplier shall accept or reject the warranty claim by written notice to the dealer within thirty (30) days after the supplier's receipt of the claim. If the supplier does not reject the warranty claim in the time period specified above, the claim shall be deemed accepted. If the supplier accepts the warranty claim, the supplier shall pay or credit to the dealer's account all amounts owed with respect to the claim to the dealer within thirty (30) days after it is accepted. If the supplier rejects a warranty claim, the supplier shall give the dealer written or electronic notice of the grounds for rejection, which reasons shall be consistent with the supplier's reasons for rejecting warranty claims of other dealers, both in their terms and manner of enforcement. If no grounds for rejection are given, the claim shall be deemed accepted.\n\n(b) Any claim which is disapproved by the supplier based upon the dealer's failure to properly follow the procedural or technical requirements for submission of warranty claims may be resubmitted in proper form by the dealer within thirty (30) days of receipt by the dealer of the supplier's notification of the disapproval.\n\n(c) Warranty work performed by the dealer shall be compensated in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete the work, expressed in hours and fractions multiplied by the dealer's established customer hourly retail labor rate, which shall have previously been made known to the supplier. Parts used in warranty repair work shall be reimbursed at the current net price plus fifteen percent (15%).\n\n(d) For purposes of this chapter, any repair work or installation of replacement parts performed with respect to the dealer's equipment in inventory or equipment of the dealer's customers at the request of the supplier, including work performed pursuant to a product improvement program, shall be deemed to create a warranty claim for which the dealer shall be paid pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) A supplier may audit warranty claims submitted by its dealers for a period of up to one (1) year following payment of the claims, and may charge back to its dealers any amounts paid based upon claims shown by the audit to be misrepresented. If a warranty claim is misrepresented, then warranty claims submitted within the three (3) year period ending with the date a claim is shown by the audit to be misrepresented may be audited.\n\n(f) The requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section apply to all warranty claims submitted by a dealer to a supplier in which the dealer has complied with the supplier's reasonable policies and procedures for warranty reimbursement. A supplier's warranty reimbursement policies and procedures shall be deemed unreasonable to the extent they conflict with any of the provisions of this section.\n\n(g) A dealer may choose to accept alternate reimbursement terms and conditions in lieu of the requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section if there is a written dealer agreement between the supplier and the dealer that requires the supplier to compensate the dealer for warranty labor costs either as:\n\n(i) A discount in the pricing of the equipment to the dealer; or\n\n(ii) A lump sum payment to the dealer that is made to the dealer within ninety (90) days of the sale of the supplier's new equipment.\n\n(h) The discount or lump sum described in subsection (g) of this section shall be no less than five percent (5%) of the suggested retail price of the equipment. If the requirements of subsections (g) and (h) of this section are met and alternate terms and conditions are in place, subsections (a) through (c) of this section do not apply and the alternate terms and conditions are enforceable. Nothing contained in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed to effect the supplier's obligation to reimburse the dealer for parts in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.",

The dealer's lien under this subsection shall constitute a perfected security interest for a period of six (6) years without the filing of a financing statement.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect in any way any security interest which the supplier may have in the inventory of the dealer, and any repurchase hereunder shall not be subject to the provisions of the bulk sales law or to the claims of any secured or unsecured creditors of the supplier or any assignee of the supplier until the time the dealer has received full payment or credit, as applicable.",
