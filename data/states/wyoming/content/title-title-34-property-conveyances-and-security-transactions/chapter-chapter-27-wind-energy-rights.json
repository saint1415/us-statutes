A wind energy agreement or a notice or memorandum evidencing a wind energy agreement shall:\n\n(i) Be recorded in the office of the county clerk where the land subject to the agreement is located; and\n\n(ii) Shall include a description of the land subject to the agreement.\n\n(d) After a wind energy agreement has terminated, the surface owner may request the wind energy developer to record a release of the wind energy agreement in the office of the county clerk where the land subject to the wind energy agreement is located. The request shall be in writing and delivered to the wind energy developer by personal service or registered mail at the wind energy developer's last known address. The wind energy developer shall record the release within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request. If the wind energy developer fails to record the release within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the request, the wind energy developer shall be liable to the surface owner for all damages caused by the wind energy developer's failure. A copy of the written request shall have the same force and effect as the original in an action for damages.\n\n(e) Wind energy becomes personalty at the point of conversion into electricity.\n\n(f) Nothing in this act shall alter, amend, diminish or invalidate wind energy agreements or conveyances made or entered into prior to April 1, 2011 provided that a contract, lease, memorandum or other notice evidencing the acquisition, conveyance or reservation of the wind energy rights is recorded in accordance with subsection (c) of this section no later than July 1, 2011.",
