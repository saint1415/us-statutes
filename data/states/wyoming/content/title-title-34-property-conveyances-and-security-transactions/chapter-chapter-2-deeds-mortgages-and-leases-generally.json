Tax deeds; possession and affidavits of possession.\n\n(a) Possession by the grantee for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months at any time after one (1) year and six (6) months have elapsed since the date of recording the tax deed extinguishes forever all the claims, right, title and interest, including the right to possession, of the former owner, and vests in the grantee any title conveyed or purportedly conveyed by the tax deed. Proof of possession by the grantee and the record of the tax deed constitutes conclusive evidence of the legality and effectiveness of the deed and any proceedings upon which the deed is based, and of the title of the grantee. As a means of proving possession and preserving evidence of possession under a tax deed, the then owner or holder of the title conveyed or purportedly conveyed by the tax deed may, at any time after two (2) years from the date of recording of the tax deed, file for record in the office of the county clerk in which the real estate is located an affidavit substantially in the following form:\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF POSSESSION AND CLAIM UNDER TAX DEED\n\nState of .... )\n\n....
