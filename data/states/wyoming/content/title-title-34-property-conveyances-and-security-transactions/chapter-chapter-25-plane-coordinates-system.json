      "text": "34-25-102. Designation of coordinates.\n\nThe plane coordinates of a point on the earth's surface, to be used in expressing the position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist of two (2) distances, expressed in feet and decimals of a foot, or meters and decimals of a meter. One (1) of these distances, to be known as the \"east x-coordinate\" shall give the distance east of the Y axis; the other, to be known as the \"north y-coordinate\" shall give the distance north of the X axis. The Y axis of any zone shall be parallel with the central meridian of that zone. The X axis of any zone shall be at right angles to the central meridian of that zone. One (1) foot shall equal three thousand forty-eight ten-thousandths (0.3048) of one (1) meter and shall be used as the standard unit of measurement for the Wyoming Plane Coordinate System. The official geodetic datums to which geodetic coordinates are referenced within the state of Wyoming including latitude, longitude, ellipsoid height, orthometric height or dynamic height shall be defined by the NSRS. Height is the coordinate value of the vertical elements of the NSRS expressed in feet and identified as ellipsoid height or orthometric height.",
