The summons shall be served either personally, or by regular mail or certified mail, addressed to the prospective juror at that person’s usual residence, business or post office address.\n\n(3) The clerk or the jury commissioner shall mail a qualification questionnaire form, accompanied by instructions, addressed to the prospective jurors at their usual residence, business or post office address. The qualification questionnaire form may be sent together with the summons in a single mailing to a prospective juror. The qualification questionnaire form shall be in a form prescribed by the supreme court. The qualification questionnaire form must be completed and returned to the clerk or the jury commissioner within ten (10) days from the date of mailing.

The qualification questionnaire form shall contain the prospective juror’s declaration that his responses are true to the best of his knowledge and his acknowledgment that a willful misrepresentation of a material fact may be punished as a misdemeanor. Notarization of the completed qualification questionnaire form shall not be required. If the prospective juror is unable to complete the form, another person may do so on his or her behalf and shall indicate that such person has done so and the reason therefor. If it appears there is an omission, ambiguity, or error in a returned form, the clerk or the jury commissioner shall again send the form with instructions to the prospective juror to make the necessary addition, clarification, or correction and to return the form to the jury commission within ten (10) days after its second mailing.\n\n(4) Any prospective juror who fails to return a completed qualification questionnaire form as instructed shall be directed by the jury commission to appear forthwith before the clerk or the jury commissioner to complete the qualification questionnaire form. At the time of his appearance for jury service, or at the time of interview before the court, clerk, or the jury commissioner, any prospective juror may be required to complete another qualification questionnaire form in the presence of the court, clerk, or the jury commissioner, at which time the prospective juror may be questioned, but only with regard to his responses to questions contained on the form and grounds for his excuse or disqualification. Any information thus acquired by the court, clerk, or the jury commissioner shall be noted on the qualification questionnaire form.\n\n(5) A prospective juror who fails to appear as directed by the commission, pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, shall be ordered by the court to appear and show cause for his failure to appear as directed. A prospective juror who fails to appear pursuant to the court’s order may be subject to contempt proceedings under chapter 6, title 7, Idaho Code, and applicable rules of the supreme court, and the prospective juror’s service may be postponed to a new prospective jury panel as set by the presiding judge.\n\n(6) Any person who willfully misrepresents a material fact on a qualification questionnaire form for the purpose of avoiding or securing service as a juror is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(7) The contents of the juror qualification questionnaire form shall be confidential to the extent provided by rules of the Idaho supreme court.\n\n(8) The clerk or the jury commissioner may provide an opportunity to a prospective juror to complete and return the qualification questionnaire form through electronic mail, facsimile transmission, or other reliable means of communication prior to mailing the qualification questionnaire form to the prospective juror.
