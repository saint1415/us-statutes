Failure to include this provision does not affect the validity of the support order. The court shall require that the social security numbers of both the obligor and obligee be included in the order or decree.\n\n(4) In a proceeding for the support of a child or a minor parent, the court may order the parent(s) of each minor parent to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for the support and education of the child born to the minor parent(s) until the minor parent is eighteen (18) years of age, after considering all relevant factors which may include:\n\n(a) The financial resources of the child;\n\n(b) The financial resources of the minor parent;\n\n(c) The financial resources, needs and obligations of the parent of the minor parent;\n\n(d) The physical and emotional condition and needs of the child and his or her educational needs; and\n\n(e) The availability of medical coverage for the child at reasonable cost as defined in section 32-1214B, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) The legislature hereby authorizes and encourages the supreme court of the state of Idaho to adopt and to periodically review for modification guidelines that utilize and implement the factors set forth in subsections (1) through (4) of this section to create a uniform procedure for reaching fair and adequate child support awards. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines is the amount of child support to be awarded, unless evidence is presented in a particular case that indicates that an application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. If the court determines that circumstances exist to permit a departure from the guidelines, the judge making the determination shall make a written or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case before the court. When adopting guidelines, the supreme court shall provide that in a proceeding to modify an existing award, children of the party requesting the modification who are born or adopted after the entry of the existing order shall not be considered.\n\n(6) If the court awards one (1) parent the right to claim tax benefits associated with his child or children, the court order need not list every applicable tax benefit. The parent who was awarded the tax benefits for the child or children shall attach a copy of the court order to his income tax return. The state tax commission shall recognize the award of tax benefits with respect to the child or children as applying to the child tax credit under section 63-3029L, Idaho Code, the food tax credit under section 63-3024A, Idaho Code, and any and all other state and federal tax deductions, exemptions, and credits for which the parent qualifies, unless the court order specifies otherwise.\n\n[32-706, added 1980, ch. 378, sec. 5, p. 963; am. 1986, ch. 222, sec. 4, p. 604; am. 1989, ch. 411, sec. 1, p. 1003; am. 1990, ch. 410, sec. 1, p. 1137; am. 1996, ch. 430, sec. 1, p. 1463; am. 1998, ch. 292, sec. 5, p. 932; am. 2000, ch. 107, sec. 1, p. 236; am. 2000, ch. 412, sec. 1, p. 1305; am. 2008, ch. 328, sec. 1, p. 899; am. 2020, ch. 271, sec. 1, p. 792.]",

The court shall consider all relevant factors which may include:\n\n(a) The wishes of the child’s parent or parents as to his or her custody;\n\n(b) The wishes of the child as to his or her custodian;\n\n(c) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parent or parents, and his or her siblings;\n\n(d) The child’s adjustment to his or her home, school, and community;\n\n(e) The character and circumstances of all individuals involved;\n\n(f) The need to promote continuity and stability in the life of the child; and\n\n(g) Domestic violence as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho Code, whether or not in the presence of the child.\n\n(2) If the parent has a disability as defined in this section, the parent shall have the right to provide evidence and information regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child.

Disability shall not include transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, other sexual behavior disorders, substance use disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania or pyromania. Sexual preference or orientation is not considered an impairment or disability. Whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be determined without consideration of the effect of corrective or mitigating measures used to reduce the effects of the impairment.\n\n(c) \"Supportive services\" means services which assist a parent with a disability to compensate for those aspects of their disability which affect their ability to care for their child and which will enable them to discharge their parental responsibilities. The term includes specialized or adapted training, evaluations, or assistance with effective use of adaptive equipment, and accommodations which allow a parent with a disability to benefit from other services, such as braille texts or sign language interpreters.\n\n(5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination on the basis of disability.
