When determining a \"lack of demonstrated consistent participation,\" the court may consider parent involvement in providing the child necessary food, clothing, shelter, health care and education and in creating a nurturing and consistent relationship for the child’s physical, mental or emotional health and development.\n\n(2) In determining if a petitioner or intervenor is a de facto custodian for the child, the court shall also take into consideration whether the child is currently residing with the petitioner or intervenor and, if not, the length of time since the child resided with the petitioner or intervenor.\n\n(3) Any period of time after the filing of a petition pursuant to this chapter shall not be included in determining whether the child has resided with the individual for the time period as provided in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(4) An individual shall not be deemed a de facto custodian if a child has resided with the individual because:\n\n(a) The child was placed in the individual’s care through a court order or voluntary placement agreement under title 16, Idaho Code; or\n\n(b) The individual is or was cohabiting with, or is or was married to, a parent of the child.\n\n[32-1703, added 2010, ch. 236, sec. 1, p. 609.]",
