The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) The purpose of this chapter is to address the concerns about the increasing threat of invasive species by providing policy direction, planning and authority to combat invasive species infestations throughout the state and to prevent the introduction of new species that may be harmful;\n\n(2) The land, water and other resources of Idaho are being severely affected by invasions of an increasing number of harmful, invasive species;\n\n(3) These invasions are damaging Idaho’s environment and causing economic hardships;\n\n(4) Idaho is a national leader in the control of invasive species, particularly noxious weeds and agricultural pests, and has a strong network of local, state, federal, tribal and private entities actively and cooperatively combating the threat;\n\n(5) Prevention, early detection, rapid response and eradication are the most effective and least costly strategies against invasive species because they combat new invasions before they expand beyond feasible control;\n\n(6) Implementing these strategies requires the state of Idaho to enhance its capacity to prioritize risks, prevent new invasions, employ early detection and rapid response techniques, apply state of the art control and management strategies, coordinate multiple public and private efforts and involve the public;\n\n(7) An effective invasive species program must foster and support local initiatives; and\n\n(8) The multitude of public and private entities with an interest in controlling and preventing the spread of harmful invasive species in Idaho need a mechanism for cooperation and collaboration to meet the threat of invasive species.\n\n[22-1902, added 2008, ch. 387, sec. 1, p. 1062.]",
