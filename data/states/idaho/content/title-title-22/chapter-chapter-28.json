If the levy of the tax is changed, the levy of the tax will continue annually at the changed rate until again changed by another referendum. Any resident of Idaho who is a registered Idaho beekeeper with the department of agriculture, and is not exempt from taxation as provided in subsection (1) of this section, may vote at such referendum.
