The department may also, upon presentation of proper identification, enter any distributor’s premises, including any vehicle of transport, at all reasonable times in order to have access to fertilizers for sampling and to examine and make copies of records relating to their distribution.\n\n(2) The methods of sampling and analysis shall be those adopted by the department from officially recognized sources including, but not limited to, the association of American plant food control officials (AAPFCO) and the association of official analytical chemists, international (AOAC).\n\n(3) The department, in determining for administrative purposes whether a fertilizer is deficient in any component or total nutrients, shall be guided solely by the official sample as defined in section 22-603(21), Idaho Code, and obtained and analyzed as provided for in this section.\n\n(4) When the inspection and analysis of an official sample has been made, the department shall forward the results of the analysis to the distributor and manufacturer, and to the purchaser upon request. Upon written request and within thirty (30) days of the results of analysis, the department shall furnish to the distributor and/or manufacturer a portion of the sample concerned.\n\n(5) If analyses of samples made by the department indicate deficiencies in the fertilizer examined, below guaranteed analysis, and in excess of the tolerances specified by rules promulgated under this chapter, the department shall immediately notify the manufacturer and/or distributor of the fertilizer of the results of the analyses. The manufacturer or seller of the fertilizer may, upon written request, obtain from the department a portion of the sample(s) in question. If he fails to agree with the analyses of the department, he may request an umpire who shall be one (1) of a list of not less than three (3) public analysts of recognized ability in fertilizer analyses, who shall be named by the department. The umpire analyses shall be made at the expense of the manufacturer or seller requesting the same.

In all prosecutions under this chapter involving the composition of a lot of commercial fertilizer, a certified copy of the official analysis signed by the director or his duly authorized agent shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the composition.\n\n(2) Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter or any rules promulgated thereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the department or its duly authorized agent of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each offense and shall be liable for reasonable attorney’s fees. Assessment of a civil penalty may be made in conjunction with any other department administrative action. No civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If the director is unable to collect the penalty or if any person fails to pay all or a set portion of the civil penalty as determined by the department, it may recover such amount by action in the appropriate district court. Any person against whom the director has assessed a civil penalty under the provisions of this section may, within thirty (30) days of the final action by the agency making the assessment, appeal the assessment to the district court of the county in which the violation is alleged by the department to have occurred.\n\n(3) Nothing in this chapter requires the director or a duly authorized representative to report minor violations of the chapter for prosecution, or for the institution of seizure proceedings, when the director believes that the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in writing.\n\n(4) Each prosecuting attorney to whom any violation is reported shall cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction without delay. Before the director reports a violation for such prosecution, an opportunity shall be given the distributor to present his view to the director.\n\n(5) The director may apply for and the court is authorized to grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule promulgated under the chapter notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law. Said injunction shall be issued without bond.\n\n[22-619, added 2000, ch. 295, sec. 2, p. 1021; am. 2001, ch. 147, sec. 8, p. 523.]",
