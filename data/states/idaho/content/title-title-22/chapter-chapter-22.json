(1) The department shall inspect, sample, analyze and test soil amendments or plant amendments distributed within this state at a time and place and to an extent as it deems necessary to determine whether the soil amendments or plant amendments comply with this chapter. The department may stop any commercial vehicle transporting soil amendments or plant amendments on the public highways and direct it to the nearest scales approved by the department to check weights of soil amendments or plant amendments being delivered or to take samples of the product being transported. Also, the department may, upon presentation of proper identification, enter any distributor’s premises, including any vehicle of transport, at all reasonable times in order to have access to soil amendments or plant amendments and to records relating to their distribution.\n\n(2) The methods of sampling and analysis shall be those adopted by the department from officially recognized sources, such as, but not limited to, the association of American plant food control officials (AAPFCO) and the association of official analytical chemists, international (AOAC).\n\n(3) In determining for administrative purposes whether a soil amendment or plant amendment is deficient in any component, the department shall be guided solely by the official sample as defined in section 22-2203(24), Idaho Code, and obtained and analyzed as provided for in this section.\n\n(4) When the inspection and analysis of an official sample has been made, the department shall forward the results of the analysis to the distributor and manufacturer, and to the purchaser upon written request. Upon written request and within thirty (30) days of the results of analysis, the department shall furnish to the distributor and/or manufacturer a portion of the sample concerned.\n\n(5) If the analyses of samples made by the department indicate deficiencies in the soil amendments or plant amendments examined, below guaranteed analysis and in excess of the tolerances specified in rules adopted under this chapter, the department shall immediately notify the manufacturer and/or distributor of the soil amendments or plant amendments of the results of the analyses. The manufacturer or distributor of the soil amendments or plant amendments may, upon written request, obtain from the department a portion of the sample(s) in question. If the manufacturer or distributor does not agree with the analyses of the department, he may request an umpire who shall be one (1) of a list of not less than three (3) public analysts recognized by the department to have the requisite ability in soil amendments, plant amendments or fertilizer analyses, who shall be named by the department. The umpire analyses shall be made at the expense of the manufacturer or distributor requesting the umpire analyses. If the umpire agrees more closely with the department, the figures of the department shall be considered correct. If the umpire agrees more closely with the figures of the manufacturer or distributor, then the figures of the manufacturer or distributor shall be considered correct.\n\n(6) Analysis of an official sample by the department shall be accepted as prima facie evidence by any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n[22-2210, added 2001, ch. 250, sec. 3, p. 910.]",

In all prosecutions under this chapter involving the composition of a lot of a commercial soil and plant amendment product, a certified copy of the official analysis signed by the director or his duly authorized agent shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the composition.\n\n(2) A person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter or any rules adopted under this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the department or its duly authorized agent of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each offense and shall be liable to the department for reasonable attorney’s fees. The department may assess a civil penalty in conjunction with any other department administrative action. No civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing under the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If the director is unable to collect the penalty or if a person fails to pay all or a set portion of the civil penalty as determined by the department, the department may recover the amount in an action in the appropriate district court. A person against whom the director has assessed a civil penalty under this section may, within thirty (30) days of the final action by the agency making the assessment, appeal the assessment to the district court of the county in which the violation is alleged by the department to have occurred.\n\n(3) Nothing in this chapter requires the director or a duly authorized representative to report minor violations of this chapter for prosecution, or for the institution of seizure proceedings, when the director believes that the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in writing.\n\n(4) A prosecuting attorney to whom any violation is reported shall, without delay, cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction. Before the director reports a violation for prosecution by a prosecuting attorney, the director shall give the person charged with the violation an opportunity to present his view to the director.\n\n(5) The director may apply for and the court is authorized to grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule adopter under this chapter notwithstanding the existence of other remedies of law. An injunction shall be issued without bond.\n\n[22-2219, added 2001, ch. 250, sec. 3, p. 913.]",
