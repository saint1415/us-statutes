It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that it is to the best interests of all the people of the state of Idaho that the abundant and natural resources of Idaho be protected, fully developed and uniformly distributed; that economic waste threatens the alfalfa seed and clover seed industries in the state of Idaho by the lack of facilities and funds for research to develop and improve control measures for diseases and pests which attack alfalfa seed and clover seed pollinators, to improve alfalfa seed and clover seed growing culture and to disseminate information to the growers, and by lack of proper advertising and dissemination of information necessary for the development and promotion of alfalfa seed and clover seed grown in the state of Idaho; and that it is in the interests of the people, welfare and general prosperity of the state of Idaho that this avoidable economic waste be eliminated by the growers having at their disposal all available information on the best and most advanced methods of culture, growing, harvesting and marketing of alfalfa seed and clover seed.
