It is in the best interests of the state of Idaho that its abundant natural resources be efficiently used and effectively managed for the benefit of its citizens. The oilseed industry is rapidly developing and significantly contributing to the economic welfare of Idaho. The products provided are an important and nutritious part of the human diet. Domestic demand exceeds what is produced in the United States. Moreover, the world market for oilseeds continues to expand. Idaho farmers are in an excellent position to take advantage of this demand. The university of Idaho leads the nation in research on canola and rapeseed. The research effort is critical to the competitiveness of Idaho growers and must be expanded and enhanced. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of the state by implementing a program of research, promotion, and consumer and industry information designed to strengthen the position in the marketplace of the Idaho oilseed industry, to expand existing markets, and to develop new markets for oilseed and their products.\n\n[22-4702, added 1996, ch. 216, sec. 1, p. 704; am. 2007, ch. 60, sec. 3, p. 143.]",
