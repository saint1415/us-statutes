The purpose of this chapter is to prevent the introduction and subsequent dissemination of plant pests into Idaho through the movement of nursery stock and other plants and plant products. This chapter provides for the regulation of plant material and plant pests moving into Idaho and establishes provisions under which such plant material and products may legally enter the state. This chapter also establishes provisions for the establishment of interstate and intrastate quarantines to restrict the movement of nursery stock, plant pests and plant products.\n\n[22-2003, added 2002, ch. 89, sec. 2, p. 211.]",

The director may promulgate quarantine rules, whereby the production, movement or existence of plants, or any other article or material, or the normal activity of persons, is brought under rules, in order that the introduction or spread of a plant pest may be prevented or limited, or in order that a plant pest already introduced may be officially controlled, thereby reducing or avoiding an economic impact that would otherwise occur through damage done by the pest or through continuing cost of control measures.\n\n(1) Federal quarantine. The department may enter into cooperative agreements with the U.S. department of agriculture, and other federal, state, city or county agencies to assist in the enforcement of federal quarantines. The department may establish a quarantine and promulgate a rule against a plant pest or an area not covered by a federal quarantine. The department may seize, destroy or require treatment of products moved from a federally regulated area if they were not moved in accordance with the federal quarantine rules or, if certified, they were found to be infested with the plant pest.\n\n(2) State plant quarantines:\n\n(a) State interior quarantine. The department may establish a quarantine against a plant pest that is not of quarantine significance to other states, to prevent the spread of the plant pest within its borders; or establish a quarantine against a plant pest of regional or national significance when no federal quarantine has been established.\n\n(b) Parallel state interior quarantine. The department may establish a parallel state interior quarantine against a plant pest which is of limited distribution in the state and is the subject of a federal quarantine. The quarantine regulates intrastate movement between quarantined and nonquarantined areas of the state. This quarantine action is required if the federal quarantine is to apply only to the infested portion of the state.\n\n(c) Uniform state quarantine. The department may establish a uniform state quarantine with other infested states which are parallel with respect to their basic quarantine requirements. The regulated area in the uniform state quarantine shall describe the area to be regulated. The quarantine shall include a reference to regulated areas of all the infested states under the uniform state quarantine. When a plant pest of regional or national significance occurs only in limited areas of the state and no federal quarantine is established, a state interior quarantine shall be established.\n\n(d) Standard state exterior quarantine. The department may establish a standard state exterior quarantine if the plant pest is not established in the state but is established in other states and no federal quarantine has been established. The department may require controls at origin or destination as are necessary to provide protection for Idaho industries, the public and the environment.\n\n(3) Regulated areas. The regulated area to be described in quarantine rules may involve the entire state, portion of the state (areas) or a list of locations of infested properties:\n\n(a) Regulated areas may be subdivided into suppressive and generally infested areas where it is desirable to augment control measures being applied in certain areas, and it is believed necessary to control movement into such areas from generally infested areas.\n\n(b) Provisions in the quarantine rules may be made for adding to the regulated area any other area known to be infested, or which is found to be infested after establishment of the quarantine, when so declared by the director.\n\n(c) When an infestation in a certain regulated area has been eliminated through the application of treatments, to the extent that movements of the regulated articles therefrom would no longer present a pest risk, the quarantine may be lifted. Provided, a hold order shall be issued to each owner of any remaining infested property in the aforementioned regulated area.\n\n(4) Movement of regulated articles:\n\n(a) Interstate shipments:\n\n(i) Any regulated article that is prohibited interstate movement or is required to be certified, if moved interstate from an area regulated by a state or federal quarantine, shall be refused entry into the state.\n\n(ii) The owner or carrier of regulated articles that are reportedly originating in nonregulated areas of a quarantined state must provide proof of origin of the regulated articles through an invoice, waybill or other shipping document.\n\n(iii) If only a portion of a state is under a state or federal quarantine, the shipment will not be refused nor a certificate required if the article originates from a nonregulated area of the shipping state, unless the article is found to be infested or prohibited.\n\n(b) Intrastate shipments:\n\n(i) Certificates or permits are required for the movement of nonexempted regulated articles when:\n\n1. Moving from a regulated area to any point outside thereof.\n\n2. Moving from a generally infested area into a suppressive area.\n\n3. Moving within a suppressive area where such control over this movement is desirable.\n\n(ii) Certificates or permits should not be required for any regulated article originating outside of a regulated area moving to another nonregulated area, or moving through or reshipped from a regulated area when the point of origin of the article is clearly indicated on a waybill, bill of lading, shipper’s invoice or other similar document accompanying the shipment, provided that shipments moving through or being reshipped from a regulated area must be safeguarded against infestation while within the regulated area in a manner satisfactory to an investigator.\n\n(iii) Certificates should not be issued unless provisions of other applicable quarantines have been met and the regulated articles:\n\n1. Originate in a noninfested portion of the regulated area and have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated area; or\n\n2.

Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored or handled in such a manner that, in the judgment of the investigator, no infestation would be transmitted thereby.\n\n(iv) Limited permits may be issued to allow the movement of regulated articles to a specified destination for limited handling, utilization, or processing, provided the investigator has determined that such movement will not result in the spread of the pest and requirements of other quarantines have been met.\n\n(v) Control over the movement of regulated articles from infested areas to noninfested areas within a regulated area may be provided for when such control over movement within a regulated area is desired to prevent the spread of plant pests. This provision usually will be applicable only when officially controlled treatments are being applied and would be handled through a direct written notice to the property owner concerned.\n\n(vi) Compliance agreements should be required as a basis for the issuance of certificates or permits in bulk to industry for their issuance, and they are desirable to explain the main provisions of the quarantine for that particular concern.\n\n(5) Temporary rules. The department may promulgate temporary rules pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, in order to take immediate regulatory action to prevent the introduction or establishment of a plant pest.\n\n[22-2013, added 2002, ch. 89, sec. 2, p. 218.]",

      "text": "22-2017. CROP MANAGEMENT AREAS. The legislature recognizes the fact that in order to produce crops that are free from plant pests, and to control such plant pests, it is frequently necessary to apply certain crop management practices over an area which may include several farms, orchards, nurseries or other crop producing entities. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, use of clean seed, destruction of infested or undesirable plants, use of chemicals and prohibiting introduction of host materials. The legislature further recognizes that it is in the public interest that the director be authorized to designate certain areas as crop management areas and to stipulate those practices which shall be followed in the management area insofar as they affect the particular crop.\n\n(1) The director may provide for establishment of a crop management area after presentation of a petition signed by not less than twenty-five (25) registered electors residing within the confines of the proposed crop management area. The petitioners shall give the petition to the county clerk of the county or counties who shall examine the signatures and certify the number of valid signatures of electors residing within the confines of the proposed crop management area and transmit the petition to the director. The director may establish a crop management area within the boundaries specified in the petition.\n\n(2) In instances where there are less than twenty-five (25) registered electors residing within the confines of the proposed crop management area, a majority of those registered electors must sign the petition in order for the petition to be considered by the director. The petitioner(s) of the proposed crop management area shall present the petition to the county clerk of the county of the proposed crop management area. The county clerk of the county shall examine the signatures presented by the petitioner(s) and shall certify that the number of valid signatures constitutes a majority of electors residing within the confines of the proposed crop management area. The county clerk of the county shall then transmit the petition to the director. The director may establish a crop management area within the boundaries specified in the petition.\n\n(3) In instances where there are no registered electors residing within the confines of the proposed crop management area, the petitioner(s) of the proposed crop management area shall present the petition to the county clerk of the county of the proposed crop management area. The county clerk of the county shall notify the director in writing certifying that there are no registered electors residing in the proposed crop management area. The county clerk of the county shall then transmit the petition to the director. The director may establish a crop management area within the boundaries specified in the petition.\n\n(4) The director may make and enforce rules to maintain the management area. Rules may include, but shall not be limited to:\n\n(a) Specification of the kind and quality of seed or other propagative material which may be planted in the area;\n\n(b) Specification of treatments, chemical or otherwise, which shall be used to control pests or undesirable plants in the area;\n\n(c) Transportation of vegetative material into, within or out of the area;\n\n(d) Disposition of infested crops, undesirable plants or other material which may include destruction of the crops, plants or other material;\n\n(e) Disposition of vegetative material planted in violation of the rules.\n\n(5) Disposition of infested or violative material in a crop management area shall be at the expense of the owner thereof.\n\n[22-2017, added 2002, ch. 89, sec. 2, p. 222; am. 2004, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 577.]",

Provided however, that whenever the cost of control and eradication exceeds the funds appropriated or otherwise available for that purpose, the state board of examiners may authorize the issuance of deficiency warrants against the general fund for up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one (1) year for such control and eradication. Control and eradication costs may include, but are not limited to, costs for survey, detection, inspection, diagnosis, treatment, and disposal of infected or infested plants and plant materials, cleaning and disinfecting of infected premises and indemnity paid to owners for infected or infested plants and plant materials destroyed by order of the director.
