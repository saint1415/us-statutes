Idaho beans are equal, if not superior, to beans grown elsewhere in the United States. However, because the bean industry in this state has failed to adequately advertise, develop and improve the superior quality of Idaho beans on a nationwide scale, this state does not enjoy its fair share of the national bean market. In the interests of the welfare and general prosperity of the people of this state, to avoid further unnecessary losses in the national bean market, and to carry on research into the growth, production and marketing of beans in Idaho, in order that the health-giving qualities and food value of our beans may become well-known throughout the United States, it is the purpose of this act to provide for and promote national advertising of Idaho beans, and to further provide for comprehensive studies and research analyses into the future production, growing, and marketing of Idaho beans.\n\n[22-2911, added 1957, ch. 94, sec. 1, p. 158.]",
