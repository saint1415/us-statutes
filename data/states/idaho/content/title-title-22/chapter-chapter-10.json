      "text": "22-1001. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that urban agriculture is the production of food and other agricultural products in urban areas of city impact settings. This includes in-ground and raised-bed production as well as aquaponic and hydroponic production systems. Additionally, urban agriculture also includes the rearing of honeybees, fish, and livestock where allowed by local government. There are four (4) broad categories of urban agriculture: Market gardening, urban farming, community gardening, and victory gardening. Urban agriculture can be a profession, supplemental or livelihood, a form of therapeutic work, a form of recreation, a mode of education, a practice of community development, an effort to increase food security and community nutrition, and a way to regenerate and beautify neighborhoods.\n\n[22-1001, added 2024, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 662.]",

      "text": "22-1002. DEFINITIONS. (1) \"Community gardening\" means a single plot of land that is gardened collectively by a group of people. Community gardens can be further divided into single plots or maintained as one (1) large plot. Entities, including but not limited to schools, food pantries, and faith-based organizations, often host community gardens. City or county land bank properties as well as privately owned plots are used for community gardens.\n\n(2) \"Market gardening\" means small scale production of agricultural products grown to sell through marketing channels such as farmers markets and community supported agriculture shares.\n\n(3) \"Urban farming\" means farming that produces food crops for sale to others and can be larger in scale than market gardening. Urban farms may be organized as for-profit businesses operated by individuals or as nonprofit social enterprises designed to provide food to address food insecurity, provide vocational training, or address another community issue, typically at the neighborhood level. Urban farms operated as social enterprises are typically managed by nongovernmental organizations. Urban farming includes indoor controlled-environment production, including hydroponic and aquaponic systems.\n\n(4) \"Victory gardening\" means producing food at one’s residence primarily for household consumption or donation.\n\n[22-1002, added 2024, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 662.]",
