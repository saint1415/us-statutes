Among the agricultural industries of the state of Idaho that contribute to the economic welfare of the state is the barley industry. Because of a surplus of barley grown in this state, and because a surplus during recurrent years has become excessive and difficult to market in the available markets, it is necessary, in order to provide a profitable enterprise for the barley growers of the state and to promote employment of labor and to assist the barley growers and those in the various industries dependent upon the barley growers, that additional markets be found and developed. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of our state by providing means for the protection, promotion, study, research, analysis and development of markets concerning the growing and marketing of Idaho barley.\n\n[22-4001, added 1988, ch. 194, sec. 1, p. 351.]",

Refunds shall cease to be available beginning on the first July 1 following completion of a referendum for the continuation or discontinuation of refunds as described in section 22-4019, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) A sale shall be exempt from the tax if a substantially similar tax is imposed by and paid to another state or foreign country and used for similar purposes with respect to the same barley.
