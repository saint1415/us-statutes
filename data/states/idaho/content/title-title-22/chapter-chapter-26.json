A majority vote of the members or stockholders, or their written assent, is necessary to adopt such bylaws. Each association under its bylaws may, also, provide for any or all of the following matters:\n\na. The time, place and manner of calling and conducting its meetings.\n\nb. The number of stockholders or members constituting a quorum.\n\nc. The right of members or stockholders to vote by proxy or by mail or by both, and the conditions, manner, form, and effects of such votes.\n\nd.
