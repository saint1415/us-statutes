In such a case, due notice shall be given in the area which may comprise the new district.\n\n(11) If a new district is formed under the procedure prescribed in subsection (10) of this section, part of the area which is composed of an old district, the state soil and water conservation commission shall cause to be filed with the secretary of state a sworn statement of a member of the commission stating:\n\n(a) The name of the district or districts deleted from; and\n\n(b) A description of the boundaries of the territory remaining in the district or districts deleted from.\n\nFrom and after the time of filing of such statement with the secretary of state, the change in the boundaries of the existing districts shall be effective.\n\n[22-2720, added 1957, ch. 218, sec. 6, p. 476; am. 2010, ch. 279, sec. 5, p. 729.]",

The county clerk or county clerks of the county or counties in which the district is located shall conduct the election for the soil conservation district, and the county clerk must provide a ballot for the district election and must provide a process that allows only qualified electors of the district to vote in that district’s election.\n\n(4) In any election for supervisor, if, after the deadline for filing a declaration of intent as a write-in candidate, it appears that the number of qualified candidates who have been nominated is equal to the number of supervisors to be elected, it shall not be necessary for the candidates to stand for election. The board of supervisors shall declare such candidates elected as supervisors, and the soil and water conservation district shall immediately make and deliver to such persons certificates of election.\n\n(5) The supervisors shall designate a chairman and may, from time to time, change such designation.

The supervisors may delegate to their chairman, to one (1) or more supervisors, or to one (1) or more agents or employees such powers and duties as they may deem proper. The supervisors shall furnish to the state soil and water conservation commission, upon request, copies of such ordinances, rules, orders, contracts, forms and other documents as they shall adopt or employ and such other information concerning the supervisors’ activities as the commission may require in the performance of the commission’s duties under this chapter.\n\n(9) The supervisors shall provide for the execution of surety bonds for all employees and officers entrusted with funds or property; shall provide for the keeping of a full and accurate record of all proceedings and of all resolutions and orders issued or adopted; and shall provide for independent financial audits in accordance with the provisions of section 67-450B, Idaho Code.

The commission may conduct such public meetings and public hearings upon such petition as may be necessary to assist it in the consideration thereof. Within sixty (60) days after such petition has been received by the commission, it shall give due notice to the county clerk of the holding of an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the county clerk shall supervise the election, and issue appropriate regulations governing such election as are consistent with chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code, the question to be submitted by ballots upon which the words \"For terminating the existence of the …. (name of the soil conservation district to be here inserted)\" shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to mark the ballot as the voter may favor or oppose discontinuance of such district.
