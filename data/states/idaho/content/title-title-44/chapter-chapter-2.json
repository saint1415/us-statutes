No employer shall be held liable in any degree on the basis of any communication between a participant and a provider unless the employer actually knew, or should have known, of the information communicated before the alleged breach of duty or harm occurred. The nature of the employment or business relationship between the employer and the provider shall not be a consideration in determining whether an employer actually knew of the information communicated between a participant and a provider.\n\n(3) No participant shall be required to waive the confidential or privileged nature of any communication as a condition of participating in an employee assistance program, but this subsection shall not apply to an employer’s referral of an employee to a provider which is a condition of the employee’s continued employment.\n\n[44-202, added 1999, ch. 366, sec. 2, p. 967.]",
