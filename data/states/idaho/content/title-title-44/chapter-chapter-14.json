When the injury was caused by reason of any defect in the condition of the ways, works or machinery connected with or used in the business of the employer which arose from or had not been discovered or remedied owing to the negligence of the employer or of any person in the service of the employer and entrusted by him with the duty of seeing that the ways, works or machinery were in proper condition.\n\n2. When the injury was caused by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer entrusted with and exercising superintendence whose sole or principal duty is that of superintendence, or in the absence of such superintendent, of any person acting as superintendent with the authority and consent of such employer.\n\n3. When such injury was caused by reason of the act or omission of any person in the service or employment of the master or employer, done or made in obedience to the rules and regulations or by-laws of the master or employer, or in obedience to particular instructions given by any person delegated with the authority of the master or employer so to instruct.\n\n4. When such injury was caused by the negligence of any person in the service or employment of the master or employer who has charge of any signal or telegraph office directing the movement of any locomotive engine, train or car upon a railroad, or any part thereof, at the time such person was injured.\n\n5. That any action brought against any employer or master under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this chapter to recover damages for injuries to or death of any of its employees, such employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where a violation by such employer or master of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.\n\n6. An employee, by entering upon or continuing in the service of the employer, shall be presumed to have assented to the necessary risks of the occupation or employment, and no others. The necessary risks of the occupation or employment shall, in all cases arising after this chapter takes effect, be considered as including those risks, and those only, inherent in the nature of the business, which remain after the employer has exercised due care in providing for the safety of his employees, and has complied with the laws affecting or regulating such business or occupation for the greater safety of such employees.\n\n[(44-1401) 1909, p. 34, 1st par. of sec. 1; I.C.A., sec. 43-2001.]",

No action for the recovery of compensation for injuries or death under this chapter shall be maintained unless notice of the time, place and cause of the injury is given to the employer within one hundred and fifty (150) days, and the action is commenced within one (1) year after the occurrence of the accident causing the injury or death. The notice required by this section shall be in writing, and shall be signed by the person injured or by some one in his behalf, but if from physical or mental incapacity it is impossible for the person injured to give notice within the time provided in this section, he may give the same within ten (10) days after such incapacity is removed. In case of his death without having given such notice, his executor or administrator or widow or next of kin may give such notice within sixty (60) days after such death, but no notice under the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be invalid or insufficient solely by reason of any inaccuracy in stating the time, place or cause of the injury, if it be shown that there was no intention to mislead and the party entitled to notice was not in fact misled thereby.
