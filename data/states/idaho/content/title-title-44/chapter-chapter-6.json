(1) Every such person, association or union, that has heretofore adopted or used, or shall hereafter adopt or use, a label, term, design, device or form of advertisement, other than a trademark or a service mark, as provided in section 44-601, Idaho Code, may file the same for record in the office of the secretary of state, by leaving two (2) copies, counterparts or facsimiles thereof with said secretary, and by filing therewith a sworn application specifying the name or names of the person, association or union on whose behalf such label, term, design, device or form of advertisement shall be filed; the class of merchandise and a description of the goods to which it has been or is intended to be appropriated, stating that the party so filing or on whose behalf such label, term, design, device, or form of advertisement shall be filed, has the right to use of the same; that no other person, firm, association, union or corporation has a right to such use, either in the identical form or in any such near resemblance thereto as may be calculated to deceive, and that the facsimile or counterparts filed therewith are true and correct. There shall be paid for such filing and recording a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). Said secretary shall deliver to such person, association, or union, so filing or causing to be filed any such label, term, design, device or form of advertisement, so many duly attested certificates of the recording of the same as such person, association, or union may apply for, for each of which certificates said secretary shall receive a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). Any such certificate of record shall, in all suits and prosecutions under this chapter, be sufficient proof of the adoption of such label, term, design, device or form of advertisement. Said secretary of state shall not record for any person, union, or association, any label, term, design, device or form of advertisement that would probably be mistaken for any label, term, design, device or form of advertisement theretofore filed by or on behalf of any other person, union or association.\n\n(2) Registration of a label, term, design, device, or form of advertisement hereunder shall be effective for a term of ten (10) years from the date of registration and, upon application filed within six (6) months prior to the expiration of such term, on a form to be furnished by the secretary of state, the registered label, term, design, device or form of advertisement may be renewed for a like term. A renewal fee of twenty dollars ($20.00), payable to the secretary of state, shall accompany the application for renewal of the registration. A label, term, design, device or form of advertisement registration may be renewed for successive periods of ten (10) years in like manner. The secretary of state shall notify registrants of labels, terms, designs, devices or forms of advertisements hereunder of the necessity of renewal within the year next preceding the expiration of the ten (10) years from the date of registration by writing to the last known address of the registrants.\n\nAny registration in force on the date on which this act shall become effective shall expire ten (10) years from the date of the registration or of the last renewal thereof or one (1) year after the effective date of this act, whichever is later, and may be renewed by filing an application with the secretary of state on a form furnished by him and paying the aforementioned renewal fee therefor within six (6) months prior to the expiration of the registration.\n\nAll applications for renewals under this act, whether of registrations made under this act or of registrations effected under any prior act, shall include a statement that the mark is still in use in this state. The secretary of state shall within six (6) months after the effective date of this act notify all registrants of a label, term, design, device or form of advertisement, under previous acts of the date of expiration of such registration unless renewed in accordance with the provisions of this act, by writing to the last known address of the registrants.\n\n[(44-603) 1897, p. 123, sec. 3; reen. 1899, p. 316, sec. 3; reen.
