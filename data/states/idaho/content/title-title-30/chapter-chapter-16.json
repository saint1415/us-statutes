A person’s beneficial ownership of ten per cent (10%) or more of the voting power of a corporation’s outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors creates a presumption that the person has control of the corporation. A person is not considered to have control of a corporation if the person holds voting power, in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this chapter, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one (1) or more beneficial owners who do not individually or as a group have control of the corporation.\n\n(8) \"Control share acquisition\" means an acquisition, directly or indirectly, by an acquiring person of beneficial ownership of shares of an issuing public corporation that, except for the provisions of this chapter, would, when added to all other shares of the issuing public corporation, beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person, immediately after the acquisition, to exercise or direct the exercise of a new range of voting power within any of the ranges specified in section 30-1604(1)(d), Idaho Code, but does not include any of the following:\n\n(a) An acquisition by a donee pursuant to an inter vivos gift not made to avoid the provisions of this chapter or by a distributee as defined in section 15-1-201, Idaho Code;\n\n(b) An acquisition pursuant to a security agreement not created to avoid the provisions of this chapter;\n\n(c) An acquisition from the issuing public corporation; and\n\n(d) An acquisition for the benefit of others by a person acting in good faith and not made to avoid the provisions of this chapter to the extent that the person may not exercise or direct the exercise of voting power or disposition of the shares except on the instruction of others.\n\nAll shares, the beneficial ownership of which is acquired within a one hundred twenty (120) day period, and all shares, the beneficial ownership of which is acquired pursuant to a plan to make a control share acquisition, are deemed to have been acquired in the same acquisition.\n\n(9) \"Day\" means a calendar day and shall consist of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, Idaho time.\n\n(10) \"Interested shareholder,\" when used in reference to any issuing public corporation, means any person, other than the issuing public corporation or any subsidiary of the issuing public corporation, that is either:\n\n(a) The beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten per cent (10%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote of the issuing public corporation; or\n\n(b) An affiliate or associate of the issuing public corporation.\n\n(11) \"Interested shares\" mean the shares of an issuing public corporation with respect to which any of the following persons may exercise or direct the exercise of voting power in the election of directors of the issuing public corporation:\n\n(a) An acquiring person;\n\n(b) Any officer of the issuing public corporation; or\n\n(c) Any director of the issuing public corporation.\n\n(12) \"Issuing public corporation\" means a publicly held corporation which has at least fifty (50) shareholders and which either:\n\n(a) Is incorporated under the laws of this state; or\n\n(b) (i) Has a place of business or its principal executive office located in this state, (ii) owns or controls assets located within this state that have a fair market value of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), (iii) has more than two hundred fifty (250) employees residing in this state, and (iv) has either (X) more than ten per cent (10%) of its shareholders resident in this state, or (Y) more than ten per cent (10%) of its shares owned of record by state residents. For purposes of this subsection, the number of employees shall be computed by including all employees of subsidiaries or affiliates of the publicly held corporation. For purposes of this subsection, the record date for determining the percentages and number of shareholders and shares shall be the last shareholder record date before the event requiring that the determination be made, except that if a shareholder record date has not been fixed by the board of directors of the issuing public corporation within the preceding four (4) months, the determination shall be made as of the end of the issuing public corporation’s most recent fiscal quarter. The residence of a shareholder is presumed to be the address appearing in the records of the issuing public corporation. Shares held of record by banks (except as trustee or guardian), brokers, or nominees shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating percentages and numbers described in this subsection. Shares of an issuing public corporation allocated to the account of an employee or former employee or beneficiaries of employees or former employees of an issuing public corporation held in a plan that is qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and is a defined contribution plan within the meaning of section 414(i) of the code, shall be deemed for purposes of this subsection, to be held of record by the employee to whose account such shares are allocated.\n\n(13) \"Market value,\" when used in reference to shares or property of any issuing public corporation or any of its subsidiaries, means:\n\n(a) In the case of shares, the highest closing sale price during the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the date in question of a share of the composite tape for New York Stock Exchange listed shares or, if the shares are not quoted on the composite tape or not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal United States securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on which the shares are listed or, if the shares are not listed on any such exchange, on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations National Market System or, if the shares are not quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations National Market System, the highest closing bid quotation during the thirty (30) day period preceding the date in question of a share on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System or any system then in use or, if no such quotation is available, the fair market value on the date in question of a share as determined in good faith by the board of the issuing public corporation; and\n\n(b) In the case of property other than cash or shares, the fair market value of the property on the date in question as determined in good faith by the board of the issuing public corporation.\n\n(14) \"Publicly held corporation\" means a corporation that has a class of equity securities registered pursuant to section 12 or is subject to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n[30-1601, added 1988, ch. 84, sec. 2, p. 148; am. 1989, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 320.]",
