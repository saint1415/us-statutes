The value of the property sought to be condemned, and all improvements thereon pertaining to the realty, and of each and every separate estate or interest therein; if it consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and each estate or interest therein shall be separately assessed. For purposes of ascertaining the value of the property, the minimum amount for damages shall be the greater of the assessed value for property tax purposes unless the court, jury or referee finds the property has been altered substantially, or the plaintiff’s highest prelitigation appraisal.\n\n2. If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel: (a) the damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned, by reason of its severance from the portion sought to be condemned, and the construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff; and (b) the damages to any business qualifying under this subsection having more than five (5) years’ standing which the taking of a portion of the property and the construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff may reasonably cause. The business must be owned by the party whose lands are being condemned or be located upon adjoining lands owned or held by such party. Business damages under this subsection shall not be awarded if the loss can reasonably be prevented by a relocation of the business or by taking steps that a reasonably prudent person would take, or for damages caused by temporary business interruption due to construction; and provided further that compensation for business damages shall not be duplicated in the compensation otherwise awarded to the property owner for damages pursuant to subsections (1) and (2)(a) of this section 7-711, Idaho Code.\n\n(i) If the business owner intends to claim business damages under this subsection, the owner, as defendant, must submit a written business damage claim to the plaintiff within ninety (90) days after service of the summons and complaint for condemnation. The plaintiff’s initial offer letter or accompanying information must expressly inform the defendant of its rights under this subsection, and must further inform the defendant of its right to consult with an attorney.\n\n(ii) The defendant’s written claim must be sent to the plaintiff by certified mail, return receipt requested. Absent a showing of a good faith justification for the failure to submit a business damage claim within ninety (90) days, or an agreed extension by the parties, the court shall strike the defendant’s claim for business damages in any condemnation proceeding.\n\n(iii) The business damage claim must include an explanation of the nature, extent, and monetary amount of such claimed damages and must be prepared by the owner, a certified public accountant, or a business damage expert familiar with the nature of the operations of the defendant’s business. The defendant shall also provide the plaintiff with copies of the defendant’s business records that substantiate the good faith offer to settle the business damage claim. The business damage claim must be clearly segregated from the claim for property damages pursuant to subsections (1) and (2)(a) of this section 7-711, Idaho Code.\n\n(iv) As used in this subsection, the term \"business records\" includes, but is not limited to, copies of federal and state income tax returns, state sales tax returns, balance sheets, and profit and loss statements for the five (5) years preceding which are attributable to the business operation on the property to be acquired, and other records relied upon by the business owner that substantiate the business damage claim.\n\n(v) The plaintiff’s good faith in failing to offer compensation for business damages shall not be contested at a possession hearing held pursuant to section 7-721, Idaho Code, if the defendant has not given notice of its intent to claim business damages prior to the date of filing of the motion that initiates the proceeding under that section.\n\n3. Separately, how much the portion not sought to be condemned, and each estate or interest therein, will be specially and directly benefited, if at all, by the construction of the improvement proposed by the plaintiff; and if the benefit shall be equal to the damages assessed, under subsection 2. of this section, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no compensation except the value of the portion taken; but if the benefit shall be less than the damages so assessed, the former shall be deducted from the latter, and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to the value.\n\n4. If the property sought to be condemned be for a railroad, the cost of good and sufficient fences along the line of such railroad, and the cost of cattle guards where fences may cross the line of such railroad.\n\n5. As far as practicable, compensation must be assessed for each source of damages separately.\n\n6. If the property sought to be condemned is private real property actively devoted to agriculture, the damages which will accrue because of the costs, if any, of farming around electrical transmission line structure(s) for a transmission line with a capacity in excess of two hundred thirty (230) kilovolts. If the property sought to be condemned has been the subject of a previous condemnation proceeding or proceedings for electrical transmission line structure(s) and at the time of condemnation the field holds other electrical transmission line structure(s), such evidence of costs referred to above may also include the cumulative effects, if any, of conducting farming operations around other electrical transmission line structure(s) in the same field, whether such structure(s) are of the condemner or not.\n\n[(7-711) C.C.P. 1881, sec. 861; R.S., R.C., & C.L., sec. 5220; C.S., sec. 7414; I.C.A., sec. 13-711; am. 1983, ch. 115, sec. 2, p. 247; am. 1998, ch. 427, sec. 1, p. 1345; am. 2000, ch. 346, sec. 1, p. 1170; am. 2006, ch. 452, sec. 1, p. 1343.]",

      "text": "7-711A. ADVICE OF RIGHTS FORM — RIGHTS WHEN CONDEMNING AUTHORITY ACQUIRES PROPERTY. Whenever a state or local unit of government or a public utility is beginning negotiations to acquire a parcel of real property in fee simple, the condemning authority shall provide the owner of the property a form containing a summary of the rights of an owner of property to be acquired under this chapter. If the condemning authority does not supply the owner of the real property with this form, there will be a presumption that any sale or contract entered into between the condemning authority and the owner was not voluntary and the condemning authority may be held responsible for such relief, if any, as the court may determine to be appropriate considering all of the facts and circumstances. The form shall contain substantially the following:\n\n(1) The (name of entity allowed to use eminent domain proceedings pursuant to chapter 7, title 7, Idaho Code) has the power under the constitution and the laws of the state of Idaho and the United States to take private property for public use. This power is generally referred to as the power of \"eminent domain\" or condemnation. The power can only be exercised when:\n\n(a) The property is needed for a public use authorized by Idaho law;\n\n(b) The taking of the property is necessary to such use;\n\n(c) The taking must be located in the manner which will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.\n\n(2) The condemning authority must negotiate with the property owner in good faith to purchase the property sought to be taken and/or to settle with the owner for any other damages which might result to the remainder of the owner’s property.\n\n(3) The owner of private property to be acquired by the condemning authority is entitled to be paid for any diminution in the value of the owner’s remaining property which is caused by the taking and the use of the property taken proposed by the condemning authority. This compensation, called \"severance damages,\" is generally measured by comparing the value of the property before the taking and the value of the property after the taking. Damages are assessed according to Idaho Code.\n\n(4) The value of the property to be taken is to be determined based upon the highest and best use of the property.\n\n(5) If the negotiations to purchase the property and settle damages are unsuccessful, the property owner is entitled to assessment of damages from a court, jury or referee as provided by Idaho law.\n\n(6) The owner has the right to consult with an appraiser of the owner’s choosing at any time during the acquisition process at the owner’s cost and expense.\n\n(7) The condemning authority shall deliver to the owner, upon request, a copy of all appraisal reports concerning the owner’s property prepared by the condemning authority. Once a complaint for condemnation is filed, the Idaho rules of civil procedure control the disclosure of appraisals.\n\n(8) The owner has the right to consult with an attorney at any time during the acquisition process. In cases in which the condemning authority condemns property and the owner is able to establish that just compensation exceeds the last amount timely offered by the condemning authority by ten percent (10%) or more, the condemning authority may be required to pay the owner’s reasonable costs and attorney’s fees. The court will make the determination whether costs and fees will be awarded.\n\n(9) The form contemplated by this section shall be deemed delivered by United States certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the person or persons shown in the official records of the county assessor as the owner of the property or if hand delivered to such person who acknowledges receipt of the form in writing on the form. A second copy will be attached to the appraisal at the time it is delivered to the owner.\n\n(10) If a condemning authority desires to acquire property pursuant to this chapter, the condemning authority or any of its agents or employees shall not give the owner any timing deadline as to when the owner must respond to the initial offer which is less than thirty (30) days. A violation of the provisions of this subsection shall render any action pursuant to this chapter null and void.\n\n(11) Nothing in this section changes the assessment of damages set forth in section 7-711, Idaho Code.\n\n[7-711A, added 2000, ch. 354, sec. 1, p. 1188; am. 2014, ch. 268, sec. 1, p. 671.]",

In any proceeding under the provisions of this chapter for the acquisition of real property, the plaintiff may take possession of and use such property at any time after just compensation has been judicially determined and payment thereof made into court. Judicial determination shall be satisfied by the following requirements:\n\n(1) At any time after an action for condemnation has been commenced under the provisions of this chapter and after the defendant has made an appearance, the plaintiff may file a motion asking that said plaintiff be placed in lawful possession of and have the use of said property and the court shall fix a date, not less than ten (10) or more than twenty (20) days after the filing of such motion, for the hearing thereon and shall require due notice to be given to each party to the proceedings whose interest would be affected by the requested taking. Notice herein shall be given as provided in rule 5(a) or 5(b), as the case may be, of the Idaho rules of civil procedure.\n\nIf the defendant has not appeared, but is not in default, plaintiff may proceed as herein provided twenty (20) days after the action shall have been commenced by serving the motion and notice of the hearing in the same manner as required for service of summons.\n\n(2) At the hearing the court shall first determine whether or not plaintiff (a) has the right of eminent domain, (b) whether or not the use to which the property is to be applied is a use authorized by law, (c) whether or not the taking is necessary to such use, and (d) whether or not plaintiff has sought, in good faith, to purchase the lands sought to be taken and the court shall enter an order thereon which shall be a final order as to these issues and an appeal may be taken therefrom; provided, however, no appeal therefrom shall stay further proceedings.\n\n(3) If the matters in the preceding subsection are determined in favor of the plaintiff the court shall hear the issues raised by the plaintiff’s motion for taking and shall receive such evidence as it may consider necessary and proper for a finding of just compensation, but the court may limit the number of witnesses presented by any party to the action, and, in its discretion, may appoint a disinterested appraiser as an agent of the court to evaluate the property to which the motion relates and to report his conclusions to the court within ten (10) days from the date of his appointment; and the court shall fix his fee which shall be paid by the plaintiff. The court shall within five (5) days after the hearing, or if it shall appoint an appraiser, within five (5) days after receiving his report, make an order of determination of just compensation.\n\n(4) Neither the order of the court determining just compensation, nor the amount of the deposit, nor the report of the appraiser appointed by the court shall be admissible in evidence in further proceedings under this section.\n\n(5) After the court has entered its order of determination of the amount of just compensation, the plaintiff may deposit such amount with the court and the court shall thereupon enter an order fixing a date from which the plaintiff shall be entitled to take possession of and use the property. After such deposit and order have been made the cause shall proceed to trial in the regular manner.\n\n(6) Any party defendant may file with the court an application to withdraw his share of the amount deposited by the plaintiff. Such application may be filed at any time after the court has entered its order placing plaintiff in possession and use of the property. If there be only one (1) defendant in the action, the court shall authorize the requested withdrawal of funds, but if there shall be more than one (1) defendant the court shall fix a date for hearing on the application to withdraw funds and shall require notice to be given to each party whose interest would be affected by such withdrawal. After hearing the court shall determine the share of the funds deposited to which the defendants or any of them are lawfully entitled and shall authorize the withdrawal requested or such part thereof as shall be proper.\n\n(7) If more than eighty percent (80%) of the amount deposited is withdrawn, the defendant or defendants making the withdrawal shall be required to make a written undertaking, executed by two (2) or more sufficient sureties, approved by the court, to the effect that they are bound to the plaintiff for the payment to it of such sum by which the amount withdrawn shall exceed the amount of the award finally determined upon trial of the cause.\n\n(8) Upon trial of the cause the court shall enter judgment against the plaintiff for the amount of the award, and the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant or defendants the amount, if any, by which such judgment exceeds the amount previously deposited; provided that if the award and judgment shall be less than the amount withdrawn under subsection (6) of this section, the defendant or defendants shall refund the difference to the clerk of the court and if such refund is not made within thirty (30) days the court shall enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against such defendant or defendants for the amount of the difference.\n\n(9) After plaintiff has deposited with the court the amount determined by the court to be just compensation, no interest shall accrue on the amount so deposited.\n\n[7-721, as added by 1969, ch. 234, sec. 1, p. 745; am. 1972, ch. 119, sec. 1, p. 236; am. 1975, ch. 141, sec. 1, p. 321; am. 2006, ch. 451, sec. 1, p. 1341.]",
