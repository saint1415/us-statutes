      "text": "7-1201. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that a significant number of people who are owed child support are not paid in accordance with the terms of their child support orders; that this causes a severe financial hardship upon custodial parents and constitutes a significant detriment to the rearing and support of minor children whom the orders intended to support. Further, P.L. 98-378 requires each state to implement statutorily prescribed procedures to improve the effectiveness of child support enforcement. Although the department of health and welfare does not have the authority to establish support orders administratively, the act as amended in 1988 enables the department to give full faith and credit to all legally enforceable support orders issued by other states. The collection remedies required by federal law are enacted in section 7-1203, Idaho Code.\n\n[7-1201, added 1985, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 418; am. 1988, ch. 294, sec. 3, p. 935.]",

(1) Upon a delinquency under a child support order for which the department is or has been providing child support enforcement services, a lien arises upon and attaches to the real and personal property of an obligor. When the amount of the lien is equal to or greater than the total support owing for at least ninety (90) days, or two thousand dollars ($2,000), whichever is less, the lien may be perfected by a filing with the office of the secretary of state. A perfected lien shall include all subsequently arising delinquencies. When a lien has been perfected pursuant to this section and the underlying delinquency reaches a zero balance or is otherwise satisfied, the lien is automatically released. Any support order or decree issued or modified after the effective date of this act shall include a provision notifying the obligor that a lien will arise automatically upon a delinquency. A notice of release of lien shall be filed pursuant to section 45-1908, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) A lien arising out of a child support order or delinquency under the laws of another state shall be given full faith and credit as if the lien arose out of a child support order or delinquency under Idaho law.\n\n(3) The department shall notify each obligor by certified mail of the filing of the lien at the same time the notice is delivered to the secretary of state. No such lien may be enforced until ten (10) days after notice of the filing of the lien has been given to the obligor.\n\n(4) The department shall notify consumer reporting agencies of any non-custodial parent who owes overdue support exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000) and is at least three (3) months in arrears after the court order is finalized. Notice shall be provided to the non-custodial parent prior to the report being made, including the methods available for contesting the accuracy of the information.\n\n[7-1206, added 1998, ch. 207, sec. 4, p. 735; am. 2025, ch. 201, sec. 2, p. 913.]",
