If the minor has not attained the age of fourteen (14) years, or fails to act with sixty (60) days after the ineligibility, death, or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor’s family, or any other interested person, may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.\n\n(5) A custodian who declines to serve under subsection (1) of this section or resigns under subsection (3) of this section, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian, by action, may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.\n\n(6) A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor’s family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor, or the minor, if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) years, may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under section 68-804, Idaho Code, or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.\n\n[68-818, added 1984, ch. 152, sec. 2, p. 364.]",
