(1) There shall be held on the first Monday in March in each year, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a meeting of persons owning or having the use of a water right in the waters of the stream or water supply comprising such district that is assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of water resources.\n\n(2) Such meeting shall be held at some place within the water district, or at some nearby location convenient to a majority of those entitled to vote thereat. The director of the department of water resources shall, at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting date, send notification by regular mail to all persons, companies, corporations or other entities known by the director to hold rights that are assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of water resources, of the time, date, location and purpose of the annual meeting. At any annual meeting, the water users may vote to waive the requirement for notice by mail and provide for notice to be given for future meetings by publication of the time, date, location and purpose of the meeting in a newspaper or newspapers in general circulation in the district or on the department of water resources website.

Notwithstanding any personnel classification assigned to the watermaster and assistants pursuant to the provisions of chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code, the water users shall, prior to the election of such watermaster and approval of the employment of assistants, fix the compensation to be paid them during the time actually engaged in the performance of their duties.\n\n(4) Voting shall be by majority vote of the water users present at the meeting unless one (1) or more water users requests voting using the procedure which follows in this subsection. In such case, the meeting chairman shall appoint a credentials committee to determine the number of votes each water user present is authorized to cast. If requested, each person present who owns or has the use for the ensuing season of any water right in the stream or water supply comprising such water district that is assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of water resources, shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the average annual dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed for that person’s qualifying water right for the previous five (5) years, or such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed. If a right has not previously been assessed, a person present who owns or has the use of the right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the dollar amount and any fraction thereof that the right would have been assessed had it existed and been reasonably used when water was available under the priority of the right during the previous season. Absentee voting and voting by proxy are prohibited.\n\n(5) At such meeting, the water users shall choose a meeting chairman and meeting secretary.

The advisory committee may be authorized to carry out policies as set forth in resolutions duly adopted by the water users at the annual meeting or at a special meeting. The advisory committee may also serve as the local committee to facilitate the rental of stored water if appointed by the water resource board for such purpose under the provisions of section 42-1765, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) A corporation or a water delivery organization, including but not limited to a water company, an irrigation district, an irrigation company or a canal company, shall be considered a person for the purpose of this section and shall designate someone to cast its vote.\n\n(8) Should said meeting not be held, or should said watermaster not be elected or the watermaster’s compensation not be fixed as above provided, then the director is authorized to appoint a watermaster and fix the watermaster’s compensation.\n\n(9) The director may remove any watermaster whenever such watermaster fails to perform the watermaster’s duty, upon complaint made to the director in writing, by one (1) person owning or having the right to the use of a water right that is assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of water resources, provided, that upon investigation the director, after a hearing with the other water users of said district, which shall be held in the district or at some location convenient to the water users of the district, finds such charge to be true, and the director may appoint a successor for the unexpired term.\n\n(10) Before entering upon the duties of the watermaster’s office, said watermaster shall take and subscribe to an oath before some officer authorized by the laws of the state to administer oaths, to faithfully perform the duties of the watermaster’s office, as provided in section 42-607, Idaho Code, and shall file that oath with the department of water resources. Upon appointment by the director, the actions taken by a watermaster in fulfillment of the duties of the office are covered by the state group surety bond as provided by sections 59-801 through 59-804, Idaho Code. A duly appointed watermaster that is reelected in consecutive years shall not be required to take and file additional oaths with the department of water resources for each consecutive year the watermaster is reelected. If a duly elected or appointed watermaster resigns, dies or is physically unable to perform the duties of the office during the remainder of the elected or appointed watermaster term of service, then the director is authorized to appoint a successor for the unexpired term as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.\n\n(a) If a water district advisory committee has been chosen as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the water district advisory committee shall meet to either nominate a successor watermaster or request a special meeting as provided in subsection (11) of this section to elect a new watermaster. Upon receipt of a nomination from a majority of the members of the water district advisory committee, the director is authorized to appoint the nominated successor watermaster for the unexpired term.\n\n(b) If a water district advisory committee has not been chosen, the director of the department of water resources is authorized to appoint a temporary successor watermaster. The temporary appointment extends through the unexpired term unless a special meeting is requested as provided in subsection (11) of this section and water users elect a new watermaster.\n\n(11) The director shall call a special meeting of the water district upon receipt of a written request for such meeting from a majority of the members of the advisory committee for a district, a written request from water users representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the votes cast at the last regular annual meeting, a written request from the watermaster, or on the director’s own motion if the director determines a meeting is necessary to address matters that cannot be delayed until the next regular annual meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the special meeting shall be given by the director in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this section, provided however, that a special meeting notice shall be sent at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting date.\n\n(12) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to acquire, hold and dispose of such real and personal property, equipment and facilities in the name of the water district as necessary for the proper distribution of water, administration of the water district and enhancement of water supplies and shall provide that all such real and personal property shall remain in the custody of the watermaster and the watermaster’s successor.\n\n(13) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to develop, coordinate or provide, through contract or by other means, for weather modification projects involving cloud seeding that are designed to increase the water supplies of the water district by enhancing natural precipitation and which conform to state water planning objectives.\n\n[(42-605) 1903, sec. 24, p. 223; reen.

(1) Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the setting of annual water district assessments and the voting of permitted, licensed and decreed water rights administered by the watermaster solely for nonconsumptive purposes shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. For purposes of this chapter, a water right is nonconsumptive if so designated by provisions of the permit or license issued by the department of water resources, or otherwise so designated by the director, or by decree of the court allowing use of the right to continue when the diversion of earlier priority water rights from the same source has been reduced or stopped by action of the watermaster.\n\n(2) A nonconsumptive water right is subject to the provisions of this section if water is taken into man-made facilities for beneficial use whether or not the water leaves the river or stream channel. Instream flow water rights held in the name of governmental entities or agencies for the protection of fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, transportation and navigation values, and water quality shall be exempt from the payment of assessments and the rights shall not be voted. The procedure for collection and payment of the assessments shall be the same as used for consumptive water rights under this chapter.\n\n(3) In preparing the next year’s budget, the watermaster shall determine an assessment for the ensuing year for each water right used solely for nonconsumptive purposes. The assessment shall be sufficient to pay the additional costs and expenses for watermaster services for data collection, water measurement, delivery of water, and record keeping directly attributable to delivery of the water right.\n\n(4) The assessment shall not become final until adopted as part of the water district budget at the annual meeting of water users in accordance with section 42-612, Idaho Code. The assessment shall not exceed an amount necessary to pay for watermaster services associated with the nonconsumptive right. Nothing in this section shall affect the right, under section 42-612, Idaho Code, of the water users at the annual meeting to provide by resolution for a minimum charge for watermaster services, except as to those instream flow rights exempt from the payment of assessments under this section.\n\n(5) The holder of a water right assessed under the provisions of this section who desires to contest the amount of an assessment for a nonconsumptive water right shall file a written petition with the director of the department of water resources stating the grounds for contesting the assessment and requesting a hearing. The petition must be filed with the director within thirty (30) days after the billing is mailed to the holder of the water right as provided in section 42-613, Idaho Code. The hearing before the director and any judicial review thereof shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1701A, Idaho Code. The filing of a petition under this section shall not relieve the holder of a nonconsumptive water right from the obligation to pay the assessment when due and payable. The amount of any excessive or deficient assessment determined by a final order of the director shall be credited or collected in the succeeding year in the manner provided under section 42-606, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) At water district meetings, each person present holding a water right used solely for nonconsumptive purposes shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the average dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed in accordance with subsection (3) of this section for that person’s qualifying nonconsumptive water right for the previous five (5) years, or such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. If a nonconsumptive right has not been assessed in previous years using subsection (3) of this section, a person present owning or having the use of the right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the dollar amount and any fraction thereof which the right is assessed under subsection (3) of this section for the ensuing season.\n\n[42-605A, added 1991, ch. 101, sec. 2, p. 227; am. 1992, ch. 339, sec. 7, p. 1019; am. 2020, ch. 52, sec. 2, p. 126.]",

(1) Each watermaster shall, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the annual meeting of the water users of the water district, prepare a proposed budget for the succeeding year, together with a distribution of the pro rata amounts of the budget assessed to the respective water users or water delivery organizations using the actual volume of water delivered for the past season or seasons. The proposed budget and distribution of pro rata assessments shall be presented to the water users for consideration and approval at the next annual meeting.\n\n(2) At any annual meeting, the water users must adopt a budget covering the estimated expenses of delivering the water of the district for the ensuing year and by resolution determine that the budget shall be collected. The compensation of the watermaster and the watermaster’s assistants and any other expenses of delivering the water of the district to the users thereof, including the costs of the advisory committee in implementing resolutions adopted by the water users of the district for activities other than the payment of the salary and operating expenses of the watermaster and assistants, shall be paid in the manner hereinafter, in this section, provided.\n\n(3) To the extent possible, funding for advisory committee expenses associated with implementing resolutions adopted by the water users for other than the payment of the salary and operating expenses of the watermaster and assistants shall come from funds available pursuant to section 42-613A, Idaho Code. If funds available pursuant to section 42-613A, Idaho Code, are not sufficient to cover expenses incurred in implementing resolutions adopted by the water users, then such expenses shall come from assessments.\n\n(4) The budget shall show the aggregate amount to be collected from all the water users in the district and the amount to be paid by each water delivery organization or other water user. For the purpose of computing the respective amounts to be paid by each water user, the actual volume of water delivered to each water delivery organization or other water user during the past season or seasons, not exceeding five (5) seasons, shall be used as a basis. If a right has not previously been assessed or if past season delivery records are not available, the watermaster may, by resolution of the water users, estimate the volume of water delivered or reasonably used when water was available under the priority of the right during the past season or seasons. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, if a water delivery organization or water user diverts water pursuant to a valid water right from a natural waterway that is regulated and assessed by one water district, and that water is then conveyed through and rediverted from a different natural waterway pursuant to section 42-105(1), Idaho Code, that is regulated by a second water district, the second water district may, by resolution of the water users, charge a fee instead of an assessment for the water that is rediverted sufficient to pay the costs and expenses for watermaster services for data collection, water measurement, conveyance of water, and record keeping directly attributable to the conveyance of the water that is rediverted. A fee charged pursuant to this subsection is not an assessment. A water delivery organization or a water user that is charged a fee is not eligible to vote at an annual water district meeting as set forth in section 42-605, Idaho Code, unless the water delivery organization or water user holds other water rights that are assessed by the water district and voting is based upon those assessed water rights.\n\n(5) Upon the adoption of the budget, the amount payable by each water delivery organization or other water user, as shown by the budget, shall become the debt of each respectively and shall become due and payable as hereinafter provided. Other provisions of chapter 6, title 42, Idaho Code, notwithstanding, water users may at the annual meeting by resolution provide for an annual minimum charge not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per water user for watermaster services. The minimum charge is applicable whenever the prorated charge against any water delivery organization or other water user is less than the minimum charge.\n\n(6) Other provisions of chapter 6, title 42, Idaho Code, notwithstanding, water users at the annual meeting may provide, by resolution, that the respective amounts owed by each water user as shown in the adopted budget shall constitute a final determination of the amount due for that year without the need to carry forward any water user debits or credits to the following year.\n\n[(42-612) C.S., sec. 5615-A, 1st par., added 1927, ch. 39, sec. 1, p. 51; I.C.A., sec. 41-512; am. 1933, ch. 217, sec. 1, p. 462; am. 1980, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 305; am. 1992, ch. 339, sec. 13, p. 1024; am. 1998, ch. 179, sec. 1, p. 665; am. 2000, ch. 83, sec. 1, p. 174; am. 2014, ch. 65, sec. 1, p. 168; am. 2015, ch. 82, sec. 2, p. 207; am. 2020, ch. 52, sec. 6, p. 129; am. 2021, ch. 107, sec. 1, p. 348.]",
