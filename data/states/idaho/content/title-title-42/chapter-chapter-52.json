If the noncompliance constitutes excess water use, the board may alternatively levy a special assessment of up to three hundred dollars ($300) per acre-foot of excess water use.\n\n(7) Any ground water user who becomes a member of a district for mitigation purposes shall be subject to no assessment beyond his proportional share of the costs, including administrative costs and other reasonable expenses, of any mitigation plan or actions or activities in furtherance of the district’s mitigation plans or purposes.\n\n(8) No assessment made pursuant to this chapter shall be a lien against any municipal property.\n\n(9) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each member shall pay a proportionate share of the total of all amounts to be assessed for the purposes aforementioned, which share shall be based on (a) the ratio that the quantity of water the member is authorized to divert under the member’s ground water right(s) bears to the total quantity of water authorized for diversion under the ground water rights of all members of the district, or (b) the ratio that the number of acres the member is authorized to irrigate under the member’s ground water right bears to the total number of acres authorized for irrigation under the ground water rights of all members of the district; provided, that the board shall be entitled to levy assessments that adjust a member’s proportionate share to take into consideration priority dates, consumptive use under the members’ respective ground water rights, other attributes of the ground water rights appurtenant to the assessed lands, and/or the benefits the member derives from a mitigation plan or other activity of the district. Any nonirrigator who is a member of a ground water district, or whose ground water rights are appurtenant to property located within a ground water district, and who has adopted and implemented a mitigation plan that has been approved by the director and that is not inconsistent with such a plan approved by the director and adopted and implemented by the ground water district, shall be entitled to an assessment credit for the contribution made by that nonirrigator’s mitigation plan toward the district’s mitigation obligation as determined by the director.\n\n[42-5232, added 1995, ch. 290, sec. 1, p. 996; am. 2006, ch. 355, sec. 2, p. 1087; am. 2016, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 317; am. 2019, ch. 33, sec. 1, p. 93; am. 2024, ch. 60, sec. 1, p. 286.]",

(1) In order to secure funds for the mitigation plan or plans for the district, the board of directors may, by resolution duly adopted and entered upon the minutes, incur indebtedness by contract with a money lending institution; provided however, that the term of such indebtedness shall not exceed thirty (30) years. To secure the repayment of any indebtedness so incurred, the board shall levy assessments over the term of the indebtedness in amounts sufficient to repay the interest and principal as it falls due. Such assessments shall be levied in the manner and shall be subject to the limitations set forth in section 42-5232, Idaho Code. Assessments to repay debt with a term exceeding one (1) year may be levied only if the indebtedness has been approved at an election pursuant to sections 42-5234 through 42-5238, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the board of directors may, before the collection of the first assessment, incur indebtedness for the purpose of organization, or for any of the purposes of this chapter, and cause warrants of the district to issue therefor, provided that the total dollar amount of the warrants authorized to be issued shall not exceed three dollars ($3.00) for each acre of land authorized to be irrigated with ground water within the district, or for each two-hundredths (.02) of a cubic foot per second of ground water authorized to be diverted and used upon lands or facilities located within the district. Following the collection of the first assessment, the board of directors may at any time issue warrants of the district for the purpose of paying claims of indebtedness against the district, including salaries of officers and employees, not to exceed the district’s anticipated revenue.\n\n(3) The warrants herein authorized shall be in form and substance the same as county warrants or as nearly the same as may be practicable and shall be signed by the chairman and attested by the secretary of said board. All such warrants shall be presented by the holder thereof to the treasurer of the district for payment who shall endorse thereon the day of presentation for payment with the additional endorsement thereon, in case of nonpayment, that they are not paid for want of funds, and such warrants shall draw interest at a rate to be established by the board of directors from the date of their presentation to the treasurer for payment as aforesaid until such warrants are paid. No warrants shall be issued in payment of any indebtedness of such district for less than face or par value. It shall be the duty of the treasurer from time to time when sufficient funds are available for that purpose to advertise in a newspaper in the county in which the district is situated requiring the presentation to the treasurer for payment of as many of the outstanding warrants as are able to be paid. Ten (10) days after the first publication of said notice by the treasurer calling in any of said outstanding warrants, said warrants shall cease to bear interest, which shall be stated in the notice.

If any obligation or contract indebtedness has a repayment term exceeding one (1) year, the board shall submit the obligation or contract indebtedness in the proposed resolution to a vote of the qualified electors of the district as defined in section 42-5210, Idaho Code, at an election to be held only if within fifteen (15) days after the passage of such resolution a referendum petition signed by qualified electors of the district whose aggregate ground water rights equal not less than ten percent (10%), measured in cubic feet per second or acres irrigated, of the aggregate ground water rights of all qualified electors of the district, shall be filed with the secretary of the district requesting that an election upon the issuance of the contract indebtedness be held and conducted under the provisions of this section.

The proportionate share shall be based on:\n\n(a) The ratio which the quantity of water the member is authorized to divert under the member’s ground water right(s) bears to the total quantity of water authorized for diversion under the ground water rights of all members of the district; or\n\n(b) The ratio which the number of acres the member is authorized to irrigate under the member’s ground water right bears to the total number of acres authorized for irrigation under the ground water rights of all members of the district.\n\n(3) The board shall adjust each member’s proportionate share of the district’s obligation based on priority date, unless the mitigation plan benefits all members equally. The board may additionally adjust a member’s proportionate share of the district’s obligation based on consumptive use under the member’s ground water rights or other attributes of the member’s ground water rights.\n\n(4) Any nonirrigator who is a member of a ground water district, or whose ground water rights are appurtenant to property located within a ground water district, may propose a separate mitigation plan to the director.

A water user who is delinquent in the payment of any assessment under this chapter, or who has failed to comply with any apportionment of mitigation obligations imposed by the board under this chapter, shall not be entitled to divert ground water until such delinquent assessment is paid in full and noncompliance is remedied in full. To commence enforcement, the district shall submit to the director a report documenting the delinquent assessment or noncompliance with the apportionment of mitigation plan obligations.

For noncompliance with the apportionment of mitigation plan obligations, the report shall identify the mitigation plan under which the mitigation plan obligations were apportioned, explain the basis for the apportionment of those obligations among district members, and document the water user’s noncompliance with the apportioned mitigation obligations. If, after the director analyzes information in the report, the director concludes that the district has reasonably apportioned those assessments based on the factors set forth in section 42-5232(7), Idaho Code, or has reasonably apportioned those mitigation plan obligations based on the factors set forth in section 42-5244A, Idaho Code, the director shall instruct the water master to curtail all ground water diversions by the water user for which assessments are delinquent or for which the user has not complied with the mitigation obligations apportioned to the user.
