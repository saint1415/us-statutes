In addition to the powers which it may now have, any district shall have power under and subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) To acquire by gift or purchase and to construct, reconstruct, improve, better or extend any works within or without the district, or partially within or partially without the district, or within any part of the district, and acquire by gift or purchase lands or rights in lands or water rights in connection therewith, including easements, rights of way, contract rights, leases, franchises, approaches, dams and reservoirs; to lease any portion of the excess or surplus capacity of any such works to any party located within or without the district, subject to the following conditions: that such capacity shall be returned or replaced by the lessee when and as needed by such district for the purposes set forth in section 42-4102, Idaho Code, as determined by the district; that the district shall not be made subject to any debt or liability thereby; and the district shall not pledge any of its faith or credit in aid to such lessee;\n\n(b) To exercise the right of eminent domain for any of the works, purposes or use provided by this act, in like manner and to the same extent as provided in section 7-720, Idaho Code;\n\n(c) To operate and maintain any works within or without the boundaries of the district, or partially within or without the boundaries of the district, or within any part of the district;\n\n(d) To issue its revenue bonds hereunder to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment or extension of any works;\n\n(e) To prescribe and collect rates, fees, tolls or charges, including the levy or assessment of such rates, fees, tolls or charges against governmental units, departments or agencies, including the state of Idaho and its subdivisions, for the services, facilities and commodities furnished by such works, and to provide methods of collections and penalties, including denial of service for nonpayment of such rates, fees, tolls or charges;\n\n(f) To pledge an amount of revenue from such works (including improvement, betterment or extensions thereto, thereafter constructed or acquired) sufficient to pay said bonds and interest as the same shall become due, and to create and maintain reasonable reserves therefor.\n\nSuch amount may consist of all or any part or portion of such revenues. In determining such cost, there may be included all costs and estimated costs of the issuance of said bonds; all engineering, inspection, fiscal and legal expenses and interest which it is estimated will accrue during the construction period and for six (6) months thereafter on money borrowed or which it is estimated will be borrowed pursuant to the water and sewer district revenue bond act.\n\n(g) To issue bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds theretofore issued under authority of the water and sewer district revenue bond act and to pay accrued interest and applicable redemption premiums on the bonds to be refunded, if the bonds to be refunded are due, callable or redeemable by their terms on or prior to the date that the refunding bonds are issued, or will become due, callable or redeemable by their terms within twelve (12) months thereafter, or if the bonds to be refunded, even though not becoming due, callable or redeemable within such period, are voluntarily surrendered by the holders thereof, for cancelation at the time of the issuance of the refunding bonds. All or part of any issue may be refunded and all or part of several issues may be refunded into a single issue of refunding bonds. There may be included with the refunding bonds, as part of a single issue, or in combination in one or more series, bonds for any other purpose or purposes for which bonds are authorized to be issued under the water and sewer district revenue bond act. Refunding bonds shall be issued and secured in such manner as may be provided in the proceedings authorizing their issuance and as otherwise provided in the water and sewer district revenue bond act, and such changes may be made in the security and revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds so refunded, as provided by the governing body in the proceedings authorizing such bonds. No election on the issuance of refunding bonds shall be required, but if by an increase in the amount of bonds or by changes in the security or pledged revenues, the requirements of the constitution for an election shall become applicable, or if refunding bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes, then such bonds with changes in security or revenues, or such bonds in excess of the amount of bonds refunded, as the case may be, must have been approved at an election as otherwise provided in the water and sewer district revenue bond act and the constitution. Refunding bonds may be exchanged for not less than a like principal amount of bonds authorized to be refunded, may be sold, or may be exchanged in part and sold in part. If sold, the proceeds of the sale, not required for the payment of expenses, and in any event, in an amount sufficient to assure the retirement of the bonds refundable, when such bonds become available for retirement, if not applied to a simultaneous payment and cancelation of the bonds refunded shall be escrowed with a bank or trust company and may be invested in United States government obligations or in obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America in such manner as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings.\n\n[42-4104, added 1976, ch. 62, sec. 1, p. 212]",
