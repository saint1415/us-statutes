      "text": "42-1701B. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE — NOTICE — CONSENT ORDER — CIVIL ACTION. (1) Authority to commence actions. The director of the department of water resources is authorized and may commence and pursue enforcement actions to remedy the designated violations set out in title 42, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Notice. When the director commences an administrative enforcement action the notice of violation shall be served upon the alleged violator in person or by certified mail. The notice of violation shall identify the alleged violation and shall specify each provision of the designated chapter, rule, permit, condition of approval or order which has been violated. The notice of violation shall state the remedy, including any demand to cease and desist, restoration and mitigation measures, and the amount of any civil penalty the director seeks for redress of the violation. Factors the director may consider in seeking the appropriate remedy include the impact of the violation and whether the violation was willful, a repeat violation for which the violator had been given a prior written warning, or the violator has otherwise refused to comply with the department’s lawful directives. The notice of violation shall inform the person to whom it is directed of an opportunity to confer with the director or the director’s designee in a compliance conference concerning the alleged violation.\n\n(3) Response. A written response may be required within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the notice of violation by the person to whom it is directed. If a recipient of a notice of violation contacts the department within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the notice, the recipient shall be entitled to a compliance conference. The conference shall be held within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of the notice unless a later date is agreed upon between the parties. If a compliance conference is not requested, the director may proceed with a civil enforcement action as provided in this section.\n\n(4) Compliance conference and consent order. The compliance conference shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of violation to explain the circumstance of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for remedying the damage caused by the violation and assuring future compliance. If the recipient and the director agree on a plan to remedy damage caused by the alleged violation and to assure future compliance, they may enter into a consent order formalizing their agreement. The consent order may include a provision providing for payment of any agreed civil penalty. The consent order shall be effective immediately upon signing by both parties and shall preclude a civil enforcement action for the same alleged violation. If a party does not comply with the terms of the consent order, the director may seek and obtain in any appropriate district court, specific performance of the consent order and other relief as authorized by law. If the parties cannot agree to a consent order within fifty-six (56) days after the receipt of the notice of violation, or if the recipient does not request a compliance conference, the director may commence and prosecute a civil enforcement action in the district court in accordance with this section.\n\n(5) Civil enforcement actions.\n\n(a) The director may initiate a civil enforcement action through the attorney general as provided in this section. Civil enforcement actions shall be commenced and prosecuted in the district court in and for the county in which the alleged violation occurred, and may be brought against any person who is alleged to have substantially violated any provision of title 42, Idaho Code, or any rule promulgated pursuant to that title. The action may be brought to compel compliance with provisions of title 42, Idaho Code, or rules promulgated pursuant to that title. The director shall not be required to prosecute an administrative enforcement action before initiating a civil enforcement action.\n\n(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude employees of the department designated by the director from issuing Idaho uniform citations or written administrative orders directing persons to cease and desist as authorized by law.\n\n(c) If the person who is the subject of the notice of violation fails to cease and desist the activity or activities constituting the alleged violation within the time limits set in the notice of violation, the director may seek, by and through the attorney general, injunctive relief in the district court pending the outcome of the administrative enforcement action.\n\n(d) In an action brought against a person for diverting water without having obtained a valid water right to do so, the director need not allege or prove that irreparable injury to the state or to other water users will occur should the preliminary injunction not be issued or that the remedy at law is inadequate, and the preliminary injunction or permanent injunction shall issue without those allegations and without that proof.\n\n(6) Penalties.\n\n(a) Any person determined in a judicial civil enforcement action to have substantially violated any designated provision of title 42, Idaho Code, or any rule promulgated pursuant to that title, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation or one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per day for a continuing violation, whichever is greater; except that persons determined to be in violation of section 42-351, Idaho Code, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed:\n\n(i) For nonirrigation uses, fifty dollars ($50.00) per one-tenth (0.1) cubic feet per second of water or part thereof diverted per calendar day, or fifty dollars ($50.00) per two tenths (0.2) of an acre foot of water or part thereof diverted to storage, up to a maximum penalty of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per year for water illegally used or diverted;\n\n(ii) For irrigation uses, three hundred dollars ($300) annually for each acre irrigated, in whole or in part, by the illegal use or diversion.\n\n(b) Civil penalties shall not be assessed for violations that have occurred more than twelve (12) months prior to the issuance of the notice of violation. The court shall determine the amount of the penalty based upon the willfulness of the violation, the economic value obtained by the violator and the damage to public resources and other water right holders. A method of recovery of the penalty shall be a civil enforcement action in and for the county where the violation occurred.\n\n(c) All civil penalties collected under this section shall be paid into the water right enforcement account established pursuant to section 42-1778, Idaho Code.\n\n(d) Parties to an administrative enforcement action may agree to a civil penalty as provided in this subsection.\n\n(7) No action taken pursuant to this section shall relieve any person from any civil liability and damages that may exist for injury or damage resulting to others.\n\n(8) Upon request of the director, it shall be the duty of the attorney general to institute and prosecute civil enforcement actions pursuant to this section.\n\n[42-1701B, added 1998, ch. 173, sec. 8, p. 607; am. 2003, ch. 165, sec. 2, p. 468.]",

If the county agrees to collect the penalty:\n\n(a) The director shall provide the county with a copy of the notice of violation issued pursuant to this section; and\n\n(b) The county shall retain half of the penalty proceeds and deliver the other half to the director.\n\n(5) Unpaid penalties shall be filed as a lien against the property until paid in full.\n\n(6) Once a penalty has been assessed for a particular irrigation season, as provided in this section, it shall be due and payable even if the excess use is subsequently resolved.\n\n[42-1701C, added 2025, ch. 129, sec. 4, p. 665.]",

As part of Part B of the comprehensive state water plan, the board may designate selected waterways as protected rivers as provided in this chapter. The comprehensive state water plan shall be based upon studies and public hearings in affected areas at which all interested parties shall be given the opportunity to appear, or to present written testimony in response to published proposals for such policy programs and proposed designations. A minimum of sixty (60) days shall be allowed between publication of a proposal and the date on which no further testimony on the proposal will be accepted. All comments in writing shall be preserved as a part of the record of the board. In adopting a comprehensive state water plan the board shall be guided by these criteria:\n\n(a) Existing rights, established duties, and the relative priorities of water established in article XV, section 3, of the constitution of the state of Idaho, shall be protected and preserved;\n\n(b) Optimum economic development in the interest of and for the benefit of the state as a whole shall be achieved by integration and coordination of the use of water and the augmentation of existing supplies and by protection of designated waterways for all beneficial purposes;\n\n(c) Adequate and safe water supplies for human consumption and maximum supplies for other beneficial uses shall be preserved and protected;\n\n(d) Subject to prior existing water rights for the beneficial uses now or hereafter prescribed by law, minimum stream flow for aquatic life, recreation and aesthetics and the minimization of pollution and the protection and preservation of waterways in the manner hereafter provided shall be fostered and encouraged and consideration shall be given to the development and protection of water recreation facilities;\n\n(e) Watershed conservation practices consistent with sound engineering and economic principles shall be encouraged.\n\n(2) The board may develop a comprehensive state water plan in stages based upon waterways, river basins, drainage areas, river reaches, groundwater aquifers, or other geographic considerations. The component of the comprehensive state water plan prepared for particular water resources and waterways shall contain, among other things, the following:\n\n(a) A description of the water resources and waterway or waterways that are the subject of the plan, including pertinent maps detailing the geographic area of the plan;\n\n(b) A description of the significant resources of the water resources and waterway or waterways;\n\n(c) A description of the various existing and planned uses for these resources including currently undeveloped areas of the waterway and future plans for those areas, with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages associated with each planned use; and\n\n(d) A discussion of goals, objectives, and recommendations for improving, developing, or conserving the water resources and waterway or waterways in relation to these resources, including an examination of how different uses will promote the overall public interest, a statement as to the goals the plan expects to achieve, and an analysis of how any specific recommendations further those goals. A description of the methodology used in developing the plan shall be included.\n\n(3) The description of the resources and uses in subsections (2)(b) and (2)(c) of this section shall contain, among other things:\n\n(a) navigation;\n\n(b) power development;\n\n(c) energy conservation;\n\n(d) fish and wildlife;\n\n(e) recreational opportunities;\n\n(f) irrigation;\n\n(g) flood control;\n\n(h) water supply;\n\n(i) timber;\n\n(j) mining;\n\n(k) livestock watering;\n\n(l) scenic values;\n\n(m) natural or cultural features;\n\n(n) domestic, municipal, commercial and industrial uses; and\n\n(o) other aspects of environmental quality and economic development.\n\n(4) The comprehensive state water plan may designate protected rivers. Designations shall be based upon a determination by the board that the value of preserving a waterway for particular uses outweighs that of developing the waterway for other beneficial uses and shall specify whether a protected river is designated as a natural or recreational river. The plan may also describe those water resources and waterways which are not designated as protected rivers.\n\n(5) In designating a natural river, the board shall prohibit the following activities:\n\n(a) construction or expansion of dams or impoundments;\n\n(b) construction of hydropower projects;\n\n(c) construction of water diversion works;\n\n(d) dredge or placer mining;\n\n(e) alterations of the stream bed; and\n\n(f) mineral or sand and gravel extraction within the stream bed.\n\n(6) In designating a recreational river, the board shall determine which of the activities listed in subsection (5) of this section shall be prohibited and may specify the terms and conditions under which activities that are not prohibited may go forward.\n\n(7) Any prohibition or terms and conditions imposed pursuant to subsections (5) and (6) of this section shall remain in effect until the legislature acts upon the recommendation of the board as provided in section 42-1734B, Idaho Code, or until the legislature revokes its earlier approval of a protected river by law.\n\n[42-1734A, added 1988, ch. 370, sec. 5, p. 1096; am. 1998, ch. 63, sec. 1, p. 221.]",

(1) Prior to the adoption of the comprehensive state water plan or any component of the comprehensive plan, the board shall conduct hearings in the manner provided in section 42-1734A, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) In the preparation, adoption, and implementation of the comprehensive state water plan, the board shall encourage the cooperation, participation, and assistance of state agencies. The board also shall solicit economic, energy, environmental, and other technical studies and recommendations from state agencies with particular expertise. All agencies of the state of Idaho shall cooperate with the board by providing requested existing information and studies pertaining in any manner to any matters which are the subject of this act. The board shall have discretion to balance all factors relevant to the formulation, adoption and implementation of the comprehensive state water plan and implementation and the designation of protected rivers.\n\n(3) Any state agency may petition the board to amend the comprehensive state water plan. The board shall review any petition filed pursuant to this section within six (6) months after it is filed and shall either commence action to amend the comprehensive plan or set forth its reasons for denying the request in writing.\n\n(4) All state agencies shall exercise their duties in a manner consistent with the comprehensive state water plan. These duties include but are not limited to the issuance of permits, licenses, and certifications; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the authority of any state agency with respect to activities not prohibited by the comprehensive state water plan. The designation of a waterway as a natural or recreation river shall not preclude the department of environmental quality from establishing water quality standards for such waterway.\n\n(5) When a comprehensive state water plan is adopted, copies thereof shall be filed in the office of the governor and director of the department of water resources, and published and distributed generally.\n\n(6) The comprehensive state water plan and any component thereof developed for a particular waterway or waterways is subject to review and amendment by the legislature of the state of Idaho by law at the regular session immediately following the board’s adoption of the comprehensive state water plan or component thereof.\n\n(7) The board shall submit all subsequent changes to the legislature as provided in section 7, article XV, of the constitution of the state of Idaho. The board shall also use best efforts to provide notice of all subsequent changes to each member of the legislature on or before the first day of the regular legislative session following the change.\n\n(8) The board shall review and reevaluate Part A of the comprehensive state water plan, or any one (1) or more of the component water plans comprising Part B of the comprehensive state water plan, upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution of the legislature directing the review or requesting a specific amendment to the plan. The board also may undertake the review in response to a petition for amendment filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, or upon the board’s own initiative, as determined necessary by the board. Amendments to Part A or Part B of the comprehensive state water plan shall be adopted in the same manner as the original plan.\n\n(9) A protected river designated by the board shall not become a final part of the comprehensive state water plan until approved by law. If the legislature does not approve a protected river by law at the regular session immediately following the board’s designation of such protected river, then the designation of such protected river shall terminate and any prohibition or terms and conditions imposed on such protected river pursuant to subsection (5) or (6) of section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, shall be terminated ten (10) days following the end of the session. The failure to approve a protected river shall not operate to invalidate a comprehensive plan or component thereof. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the legislature, however, from approving such protected river and reinstituting or modifying such prohibitions or terms and conditions in a subsequent session.\n\n(10) After adoption of a comprehensive plan or component thereof, the board shall administer the implementation of the plan.\n\n[42-1734B, added 1988, ch. 370, sec. 5, p. 1098; am. 1998, ch. 63, sec. 2, p. 223; am. 2017, ch. 131, sec. 1, p. 308; am. 2025, ch. 47, sec. 12, p. 232.]",

Any state agency may petition the board to designate a waterway as an interim protected river. The board shall promulgate procedural rules for designation of interim protected rivers. The rules shall provide adequate notice to interested parties of any petitions filed or actions contemplated pursuant to this act.\n\n(2) The board shall determine whether the nominated waterway merits designation as an interim protected river. The board shall accept or reject a nomination within six (6) months after it is filed. There shall be no review of any board decision rejecting or accepting a nomination for an interim protected river. Designation of a waterway as an interim protected river shall be based upon a determination that:\n\n(a) It is probable that the waterway would be designated a protected river in the comprehensive state water plan; and\n\n(b) Interim protected river status is necessary to protect the values that would support such waterway’s designation as a protected river in a comprehensive state water plan.\n\n(3) In designating a waterway for interim protected river status, the board shall indicate which of the activities listed in subsection 42-1734A(5), Idaho Code, shall be prohibited.\n\n(4) Interim protected river status shall remain in effect until the earliest of:\n\n(a) The adoption of a comprehensive state water plan for the waterway designated as an interim protected river;\n\n(b) Two (2) years following the designation of an interim protected river unless extended by law;\n\n(c) The revocation of a waterway’s interim protected river status by law.\n\n(5) Any person may petition the board for a determination that a particular proposed action or project will not significantly impair the values supporting a waterway’s designation as an interim protected river. The board shall consider among other things environmental impact statements, technical studies and any other relevant comments or recommendations prepared by the petitioner for use before other state or federal agencies. The board may also consider any other relevant information. If the board determines that the proposed action or project will not significantly impair the values supporting a waterway’s designation as a protected river, then this section shall not apply to such action or project, except that the board, after consultation with relevant state agencies, may impose appropriate conditions on such action or project. An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of the board’s decision pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) If a waterway is designated as an interim protected river, then the board shall proceed to prepare a comprehensive state water plan for the waterway. The board shall in preparing the state comprehensive water plan for the waterway consider, after review of all relevant factors contained in section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, whether the designation should continue or whether modification of the designation is warranted.\n\n(7) If the designation of a waterway as an interim protected river is either revoked by law, or terminated as provided in this section, then the waterway shall not be eligible for designation as an interim protected river for a period of two (2) years following the revocation or termination of its interim protected river status.\n\n[42-1734D, added 1988, ch. 370, sec. 5, p. 1099; am. 1993, ch. 216, sec. 37, p. 620.]",

      "text": "42-1763B. INTERIM AUTHORITY FOR RENTAL OF WATER TO AUGMENT FLOWS FOR LISTED ANADROMOUS FISH. (1) Legislative findings and intent regarding rental of water by the U.S. bureau of reclamation in the Snake River basin within Idaho to augment lower Snake River flows for anadromous fish listed under the endangered species act. The legislature finds that the U.S. bureau of reclamation proposes to release up to four hundred twenty-seven thousand (427,000) acre feet of leased or uncontracted water diverted from the Snake River basin to reservoir storage above Lewiston, and to lease or acquire up to sixty thousand (60,000) acre feet of consumptive natural flow water rights diverted and consumed below Milner dam and above Swan Falls dam from the mainstem of the Snake River to augment flows downstream of Hells Canyon dam during 2005 and through December 31, 2034. The state of Idaho is experiencing serious drought conditions and it is therefore uncertain whether this water will be available for rental for flow augmentation purposes in all years. The legislature further finds that authorization of this legislation is necessary for approval and implementation of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004 (Mediator’s Term Sheet dated April 20, 2004, and submitted on that date to the SRBA Court in SRBA Consolidated Subcase 03-10022 and SRBA Consolidated Subcase 67-13701, with all appendices to the document), as approved, ratified, and confirmed by the 108th Congress of the United States in the \"Snake River Water Rights Act of 2004,\" Pub. L. No. 108-447 (H.R. 4818), 118 Stat. 3431 to 3441 (December 8, 2004). Therefore, the legislature authorizes the U.S. bureau of reclamation to lease storage and natural flow water rights through the state water supply bank and local rental pools under the limited conditions of this section. Any rentals of water for flow augmentation under any other provision of law, including section 42-108A, Idaho Code, shall be subject to the limitations and conditions of this section and the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004.\n\n(2) Rental of water by the U.S. bureau of reclamation.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding the legislative approval required in section 42-108, Idaho Code, any storage water released and any natural flow water rights leased or acquired by the bureau within the state of Idaho for listed anadromous fish pursuant to this section must be rented through the water bank operated by the Idaho water resource board pursuant to sections 42-1761 through 42-1764, Idaho Code, or, in the case of storage water releases, through local rental committees, created pursuant to section 42-1765, Idaho Code, under their respective water bank rules.\n\n(b) For any rental of water pursuant to this section, the director shall not be required to determine under section 42-1763, Idaho Code, whether the water supply is sufficient for the purpose for which it is sought, whether the rental would cause the use of water to be enlarged beyond that authorized under the water right to be rented, whether such use is in the public interest, or whether such use is consistent with the factors enumerated under subsection (3) of section 42-401, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) Conditions on water rentals.\n\n(a) Any water made available under this section shall be obtained only from willing lessors. Any water rented under this section from sources located within a basin having a local rental committee established pursuant to section 42-1765, Idaho Code, or section 42-1765A, Idaho Code, shall be rented pursuant to this section only through the local rental committee.\n\n(b) Storage water made available under this section shall be limited to four hundred twenty-seven thousand (427,000) acre feet annually, and natural consumptive flow water shall be limited to not more than the sixty thousand (60,000) acre feet annually, that accrue to natural flow water rights, acquired or leased by the U.S. bureau of reclamation pursuant to the terms of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004. These amounts shall be reduced by other water the U.S. bureau of reclamation provides for flow augmentation for listed anadromous fish from the Snake River basin above Lewiston.\n\n(c) In no event shall the release of water under this section cause the water surface of Lake Cascade to be below the elevation required to maintain a storage volume of three hundred thousand (300,000) acre feet, fifty thousand (50,000) acre feet of which is dead space, which is currently estimated to be at an elevation of four thousand eight hundred nine and two-tenths (4,809.2) feet. In addition, the state of Idaho shall pursue a shaping agreement for any uncontracted water released from Lake Cascade under this section.\n\n(d) The rental or use of water under this section shall be in compliance with any permit, applicable water quality rule and regulation or other requirements of the clean water act, shall not cause jeopardy to other species in the state of Idaho, and shall not result in significant adverse impacts to recreational uses of the waters of the Snake River basin in Idaho. The state of Idaho shall not require any restriction, modification, or condition on the diversion, storage, use, discharge of water, or land use to remedy or address violations of water quality standards or other clean water act requirements to the extent the rental or use of water by the U.S. bureau of reclamation under this section causes the violations.\n\n(e) The U.S. bureau of reclamation shall submit a report to the director by January 15 of each year describing the time, volume and purpose of water provided for listed anadromous fish from the Snake River basin above Lewiston during the past year and shall report on the plan for the spring and summer chinook by April 1 and on the plan for the fall chinook by July 15 of each year.\n\n(f) All water rented or used by the U.S. bureau of reclamation under this section from above Hells Canyon dam must be used for power production purposes within the state of Idaho.\n\n(g) All water rented or used by the U.S. bureau of reclamation under this section shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Snake River Flow Component of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004.\n\n(h) Nothing herein shall entitle the U.S. bureau of reclamation to rent or use water for flow augmentation upon termination or expiration of the permission given in this section.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter, or authorize the U.S. bureau of reclamation to modify in any way its existing contractual obligations, or to constitute a finding by the legislature that the rental or use of storage water or natural flow water rights for flow augmentation for listed anadromous fish or any other species is a beneficial use of water, that it is in the public interest, or whether such use injures existing water rights.\n\n(5) This section shall not become effective until the director certifies to the governor that the U.S. bureau of reclamation’s applications to transfer water right numbers 4616, 4617, 4618, 4623, 4625, 4626, 4627, 4628, 4629, 4630, 4631, 4632, 4633 and 4636, and to amend water right permit numbers 25-07004 and 63-3618 will be withdrawn, or held in abeyance while this section is in effect, and the governor further certifies that the biological opinions required by the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004 have been issued.\n\n(6) This act shall be null, void and of no force and effect upon the expiration or termination of the Snake River Flow Component of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004. In addition, it is the intent of the legislature to consider the repeal of this section in the event that any of the provisions of the Snake River Flow Component of the Snake River Water Rights Agreement of 2004 are modified or declared arbitrary, capricious or otherwise unlawful or set aside by any federal court or there is a finding of jeopardy by any federal court in regard to any biological opinions for projects operated by the U.S. bureau of reclamation in the Snake River basin in Idaho.\n\n[42-1763B, added 1996, ch. 282, sec. 1, p. 912; am. 2000, ch. 222, sec. 2, p. 616; am. 2001, ch. 394, sec. 1, p. 1372; am. 2002, ch. 349, sec. 1, p. 997; am. 2005, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 462; am. 2005, ch. 400, sec. 1, p. 1363.]",
