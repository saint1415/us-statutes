The payment of such liens shall be made to the same county officer to whom other county taxes are required by law to be paid and become due and delinquent on the same day of the year as other county taxes. The date of the maturity of said lien shall be fixed by resolution of the county commissioners at the time of the issue of said bonds, and shall correspond to the maturity of said bonds. The said principal lien shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed six per cent (6%) per annum, payable annually on the same day of the year provided by law for the payment of the other county taxes, such interest to be reckoned from the date of the filing of the lien statement in the office of the county recorder and interest on the whole of the principal of such lien remaining from time to time unpaid shall be paid annually on the same day of each year except as hereinafter in this section otherwise provided. In case bonds shall be issued by the county then the lien shall bear the same rate of interest as such bonds. On or before the first day of October next following such filing of the lien in the office of the county recorder, the county auditor shall for the purpose of enforcing payment of such lien, enter on a project lien record of said county the whole amount of such lien remaining unpaid against each respective tract of land subject thereto, and shall at the same time, or before tax lists or tax rolls are turned over to the county tax collector, compute interest as in this chapter provided on such unpaid amount to the first day of July following and shall enter such interest on the tax list and tax rolls for such year and the instalments of such lien and interest thereon together with such amount as may be required for the sinking fund as herein provided shall be collected in the same manner as real estate taxes for that year on the tract in question are collected, and the county auditor shall in the same manner each year thereafter compute interest on the amount of such lien remaining unpaid and not previously entered on the tax rolls of prior year, or years, together with interest to the first of July and enter the same together with the instalment, if any, together with such amount as may be required for the sinking fund as herein provided then due on the tax lists and tax rolls, said instalment, interest and sinking fund to be collected in like manner as the first payment until the whole amount of any such lien and accumulated interest shall have been so entered on the tax rolls and tax lists of such county, and all of the provisions of law now or hereafter existing in relation to the collection of real estate taxes so far as applicable hereto are hereby adopted for the purpose of enforcing payment of such liens and instalments thereof and of the interest thereon, and each of the same shall be subject to the same penalties for delinquency in payment as provided by law for other county taxes. When payment of the full amount of such liens with accumulated interest shall thus, or at any one time, be made, the auditor upon presentation of a receipt from the treasurer to that effect, shall issue under his hand and official seal a certificate of such payment and the same when recorded in the office of the county recorder shall release and discharge said lien of record. If any item of cost of an irrigation or drainage project established under this chapter from the inception of such project to its completion has been, or shall be omitted from the original tabular statement for assessments made and filed by the auditor with the county recorder, then a supplementary statement or assessment shall be made by said auditor in the same form and manner as the original statement so far as practicable showing such omitted costs, which supplementary statement or assessment shall be filed for record in the office of the county recorder and shall be due and payable and collectible in the same manner, time and form as if a part of the last annual instalment of the original assessment.\n\n[(42-2816) 1921, ch. 222, sec. 16, p. 492; I.C.A., sec. 41-2416.]",
