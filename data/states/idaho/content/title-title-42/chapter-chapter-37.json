      "text": "42-3717. DISCONTINUANCE — DISSOLUTION OF DISTRICTS. (1) At any time after three (3) years after the organization of a district under the provisions of this chapter any twenty-five (25) qualified electors or owners of land lying within the boundaries of such district or, if less than twenty-five (25) owners of land or qualified electors reside within the boundaries of such district it would be deemed sufficient if two-thirds (2/3) of the resident group, may file a petition with the state soil and water conservation commission requesting that the operations of the district be terminated and the existence of the district discontinued. After such petition has been received by the state soil and water conservation commission it shall give notice of the holding of an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, which the said commission shall supervise and govern the conduct in accordance with the provisions of chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code. The question to be submitted by ballots upon which the words \"For terminating the existence of the (name of the watershed improvement district to be here inserted)\" and \"Against terminating the existence of the (name of the watershed improvement district to be inserted here)\" shall appear with a square before each proposition, and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose discontinuance of such district. All qualified electors who own land or reside within the proposed district shall be eligible to vote in said election. No informality in the conduct of such election or in any matters relating thereto shall invalidate said election or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given as herein provided, and said election shall have been fairly conducted.\n\nThe state soil and water conservation commission shall certify the result of such election to the directors of the district. If the state soil and water conservation commission shall certify that a majority of the votes cast in said election favor the discontinuance of the existence of the district, the directors of the district shall forthwith proceed to terminate the affairs of the district. Any moneys remaining in the treasury of said district following the winding up of the affairs of the district shall be paid by the directors into the state treasury. The directors shall file an application duly verified with the secretary of state for the discontinuance of such district which shall recite that the affairs of the district have been wound up, and shall set forth a full accounting of the winding up of the affairs of said district. The secretary of state shall issue to the directors a certificate of dissolution, and shall record said certificate in his office.\n\nThe state soil and water conservation commission shall not entertain petitions for the discontinuance of any district nor conduct elections upon such petitions more often than once in three (3) years.\n\n(2) Provided however, any district that fails or has ceased to function for two (2) or more years may be dissolved by the board or boards of county commissioners of the county or counties in which it is located. The county commissioners may initiate such action upon their own volition, or the action may be initiated by petition.\n\n[42-3717, added 1957, ch. 226, sec. 17, p. 508; am. 1995, ch. 118, sec. 75, p. 491; am. 2010, ch. 279, sec. 32, p. 754; am. 2016, ch. 295, sec. 1, p. 826.]",
