(1) Any person who, as owner or operator, proposes to construct a well or to alter a well or to construct or to alter an injection well shall first apply to the director for a geothermal resource well permit, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(2) The use of ground water classified as a geothermal resource or material medium for the development and operation of oil and gas wells permitted under section 47-316, Idaho Code, shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter. However, the director of the department of water resources may initiate a contested case in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and the rules of procedure promulgated by the department, if the department has reason to believe that an oil and gas well will cause, is causing or has caused, significant negative impacts to pressure, temperature, quality necessary for beneficial use or quantity of water available to water rights existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well or to a geothermal resource that can be beneficially used. The evidence of causation must come from the department or be credible information from a water right holder or a geothermal resource permit holder existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well. It shall be the burden of the entity operating the oil and gas well to establish that it will not cause, is not causing and has not caused significant negative impacts to pressure, temperature, quality necessary for beneficial use or quantity of water available to existing water rights existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well or to geothermal resource that can be beneficially used. If the director determines that the well will cause, is causing or has caused significant negative impacts to pressure, temperature, quality necessary for beneficial use or quantity of water available to a water right existing at the time of the development of the oil and gas well or to a geothermal resource that can be beneficially used, the director may order the operator to take measures to mitigate those impacts.\n\n(3) Such application required pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall set out the following information on a form or forms prescribed by the department:\n\n(a) The name of any person making the application; if such person is a partnership, joint-venture, association, or other unincorporated group of corporate or natural persons, the names and places of domicile of each of the constituent persons who have general partnership responsibility and authority for and in such unincorporated group of persons; if any person named on a permit application is a corporation, its place of domicile, the names and places of domicile of its principal executive officers, and the names and places of domicile of any person or persons owning a thirty percent (30%) or greater interest, whether legal, beneficial, or a combined legal and beneficial interest, in such corporate person; if the applicant is making an application as an agent for any other person, it shall be clearly so stated and any person who is the applicant’s principal shall be subject to each and all of the disclosure requirements of this subsection; for purposes of this subsection, the domicile of a corporation is at all of the following:\n\n(i) The place of incorporation;\n\n(ii) The principal place of business;\n\n(iii) The place, by city and state, of the home office, and in any instance where domicile is required to be disclosed all of these places shall be specified.\n\n(b) The location of the proposed well; and/or the injection well described particularly by the quarter-quarter section according to the township and range system of the United States public lands survey.\n\n(c) The length, size, type, and thickness of casing proposed to be used in such well and/or such injection well and any other devices or techniques to be used in the drilling, operation, and maintenance of such well and/or injection well for the purpose of conserving geothermal resources and their availability, avoiding waste and for the protection of other subsurface natural resources.\n\n(d) The character and composition of the material expected to be derived from such well.\n\n(e) The means proposed to be used to contain and manage the material expected to be derived from such well or injected into such injection well in order to avoid unreasonable damage to life, property, or surface and atmospheric natural resources.\n\n(f) Whether such well or such injection well is proposed to be constructed as a part of a program for exploration or for development of an already explored geothermal resource area.\n\n(g) Such other information as the director may determine to be necessary for the administration of this chapter.\n\n(4) Any application for a permit to construct a well which is made pursuant to this section, if the construction or operation of such well will involve the use of water, or if such well may be expected to yield water to be used, for any beneficial purpose, other than as a mineral source, an energy source, or otherwise as a material medium, shall be accompanied by an application to appropriate the public waters of this state in the form prescribed in chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code, and by rules adopted pursuant thereto, and such application to appropriate the public waters shall be governed in all respects by that chapter.\n\n(5) Any application for a permit made pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by a filing fee of:\n\n(a) Two hundred dollars ($200) if for a well; or\n\n(b) One hundred dollars ($100) for an injection well;\n\nand no application shall be accepted and filed by the director until such filing fee has been deposited with him. All moneys received under the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited with the state treasurer in the water administration fund as provided in section 42-238a, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) No person shall construct or alter a well or an injection well without having first secured a permit therefor; provided however, that the director may, by general rule adopted pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, exempt specific categories of wells or injection wells otherwise embraced by this chapter upon a finding that the purposes of this chapter do not require that such wells be subject to the permit requirement of this section.\n\n(7) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as affecting any valid, vested water rights for water in use on or before July 1, 1987.\n\n(8) The director shall have the authority to and may designate any area of the state a \"geothermal area\" when the director finds or has reason to believe that such designation is necessary to protect the geothermal resource from waste and to protect other resources of the state from contamination or waste.\n\n(9) No person shall drill a well for any purpose to a depth of three thousand (3,000) feet or more below land surface in a designated \"geothermal area\" without first obtaining a permit under the provisions of this section. Such permit shall be in addition to any permit required by other provisions of law.\n\n(10) The owner of any well constructed or being constructed pursuant to section 47-316, Idaho Code, who encounters a geothermal resource, and who intends or desires to utilize such resource, shall make application for a geothermal permit as required under this section, provided however, that no additional filing fee shall be required.\n\n(11) A geothermal resource shall be utilized primarily for its heat value. Usage of a geothermal resource primarily for some reason other than its heat value shall not be deemed a beneficial use of the resource.\n\n[42-4003, added 1972, ch. 301, sec. 4, p. 749; am. 1974, ch. 20, sec. 51, p. 533; am. 1974, ch. 297, sec. 2, p. 1753; am. 1987, ch. 347, sec. 15, p. 758; am. 2007, ch. 189, sec. 1, p. 554; am. 2012, ch. 111, sec. 6, p. 307; am. 2017, ch. 271, sec. 30, p. 710.]",

(a) Upon receipt of an application made pursuant to section 42-4003, Idaho Code, it shall be the duty of the director to examine such application to ascertain, within thirty (30) days of receipt, if it sets forth all information required by that section and all the information necessary for the director to make the determination required by this section. If upon such examination the application is found to be defective, the director shall return such application for correction, or notify the applicant that such application is defective, and the applicant may correct such application within thirty (30) days or make a new application. All applications which comply with the provisions of this chapter and with the rules of the water resource board shall be accepted by the director and numbered in a manner which will aid in their identification.\n\n(b) Within thirty (30) days of the receipt and acceptance of a proper application and the determination of its completeness in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the director shall undertake and thereafter diligently conduct such investigations as necessary to determine that the construction or alteration of the proposed well or injection well will be in the public interest. The director may consider, but is not limited in his consideration to:\n\n(1) The financial resources of the applicant, his principal, or other person who may be legally responsible for the subject well or injection well, and the probability that such person will be financially able to bear all costs for which he might be responsible which may be incident to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the well or injection well proposed to be constructed or altered.\n\n(2) The adequacy of measures proposed to safeguard subsurface, surface, and atmospheric resources from unreasonable degradation, and especially to protect ground-water aquifers and surface-water sources from contamination which would render such water of lesser quality than it would have had but for the contamination.\n\n(3) The possibility that the construction and maintenance of the proposed well will cause waste or will damage any geothermal resource, reservoir, or other source, by unreasonable reduction of pressures or unreasonable reduction of any geothermal resource material medium or in any other manner, so as to render any geothermal resource of unreasonably less value.\n\n(4) The adequacy of measures proposed to safeguard the environment of the area around the site of the proposed well from unreasonable contamination or pollution.\n\n(5) Any possible interdependence between any geothermal resource, reservoir, pool, or other source expected to be affected under the permit and any aquifers or other sources of ground waters used for beneficial uses other than uses as a material medium or a mineral source, and the probability that such interdependence may cause such ground-water sources to be inadequate to meet demands on them under existing water rights.\n\n(c) Upon completion of the investigations required under subsection (b) of this section, the director shall approve the application in whole or in part or upon conditions, or reject the application. Any applicant or the director shall have a right to have a public hearing concerning the propriety of issuing a permit for which an application has been made under section 42-4003, Idaho Code. Hearings held under this subsection shall be governed by rules of procedure adopted by the water resource board pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Hearings held under this subsection shall be held at any location found to be appropriate by the water resource board.\n\n[42-4004, added 1972, ch. 301, sec. 5, p. 749; am. 1974, ch. 20, sec. 52, p. 533; am. 2007, ch. 189, sec. 2, p. 556.]",

(a) If the director finds that the well or the injection well as proposed to be constructed or altered is in the public interest, he shall issue a permit. The director may issue a permit substantially in accordance with the specifications on the application, or the director may limit the scope of the permit granted or may issue a permit subject to conditions.\n\n(b) If the director finds that the well or injection well as it is proposed to be constructed or altered in the application will not be in the public interest, he shall refuse to issue a permit. In no case shall the director issue a permit to construct or alter a well or injection well if he finds that use of the proposed well or injection well may be expected to unreasonably reduce the quality of any surface or ground waters below the quality which such waters would have had but for the proposed well.\n\n(c) If the director refuses to issue a permit, or issues one subject to conditions or limitations, he shall issue a clear statement of his reasons for refusing to issue or issuing the limited permit. The director shall issue a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law that provides a factual and legal basis for the order. The refusal of the director to issue a permit, together with the clear statement of the reasons for refusing to issue the permit shall be served on the applicant by certified mail. A permit issued conditionally or subject to limitations shall, with the statement of reasons required under this subsection, be served in the same manner as a refusal to issue a permit.\n\n(d) An applicant denied a permit or issued a limited or conditional permit may seek a public hearing before the water resource board. A certified transcript of the proceedings and the evidence received at such hearing shall be maintained by the board. The board shall affirm, modify or reject the director’s decision, and make its decision in the form of an order to the director. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Judicial review of the final determination by the board may be secured pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(e) The director shall not issue a permit if he finds that the operation of any well under a proposed permit will decrease ground water in any aquifer or other ground water source or will unreasonably decrease ground water available for prior water rights in any aquifer or other ground water source of water for beneficial uses, other than uses as a mineral source, an energy source, or otherwise as a material medium, unless and until the applicant has also obtained a permit for the appropriation of ground waters under chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code.\n\n(f) The director shall require, as a condition of every permit, that every person who engages in the construction, alteration, testing, or operation of a well provide evidence of good and sufficient security in the form of a bond, trust fund, letter of credit, insurance or other acceptable surety that ensures that the applicant perform the duties required by this chapter and properly abandon any well covered by such permit. Good and sufficient security shall be an amount not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) as determined by the director based on the size and depth of the well, the complexity of the well, the resource to be recovered, the area of operation, and other relevant factors.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the requirements for sufficient security for individual permits identified in this section, the director shall have the discretion to accept evidence of good and sufficient security in the form of a comprehensive wellfield or statewide bond, trust fund, letter of credit, insurance or other acceptable surety for all well permits owned by the applicant within a field or within the state, provided the amount of the comprehensive security does not exceed the total sum of the amounts under each individual permit.\n\n[42-4005, added 1972, ch. 301, sec. 6, p. 749; am. 1974, ch. 20, sec. 53, p. 533; am. 1980, ch. 238, sec. 22, p. 551; am. 1987, ch. 347, sec. 16, p. 760; am. 1993, ch. 216, sec. 40, p. 623; am. 2004, ch. 63, sec. 1, p. 284; am. 2007, ch. 189, sec. 3, p. 557.]",

(a) Whenever the director finds that it is in the public interest and especially in the interest of the conservation of natural resources and of the protection of the geothermal resources of this state from waste, the lessors, lessees, operators, owners, or other persons holding or controlling royalty or other interests in the separate properties of the same geothermal area may, with the approval of the board, enter into an agreement for the purpose of bringing about the cooperative development, operation, and maintenance of all or a portion of the geothermal resources of the geothermal area as a unit; or for the purpose of fixing the time, location, and manner of drilling, operating, and maintaining of wells and of injection wells. Any such agreement shall bind the successors and assigns of the parties thereto and shall be enforceable by the parties thereto by an action for specific performance. No such agreement, when approved by the board pursuant to this section, shall be held to violate any of the statutes of this state prohibiting monopolies or acts, arrangements, agreements, contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce to the extent that the provisions of such agreement relate to the purpose of this section. No such agreement authorization shall constitute a waiver of any permit, license, lease, or other authorization required under this act or under any other provision of state law or any regulation adopted by any agency or subdivision of this state. The board may establish procedures to govern the establishment or adoption of such cooperative unit agreements.\n\n(b) Whenever the director finds that a geothermal resource area should be cooperatively operated as a unit to avoid waste, and the persons owning tracts or interests in such area refuse to enter into a cooperative agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the board, after notice and hearing, may issue an order that such area shall be operated as a unit. Such order shall provide an equitable sharing of proceeds and liabilities from the geothermal resource area among the several owners of tracts and interests therein.\n\n[42-4013, added 1972, ch. 301, sec. 14, p. 749; am. 1974, ch. 20, sec. 61, p. 533.]",
