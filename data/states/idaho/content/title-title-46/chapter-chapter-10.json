Executive orders and proclamations have the force and effect of law; provided, however, that any such orders, proclamations, or rules must be essential to protect life or property from the occurrence or imminent threat of the state of disaster emergency threatening the safety of persons or property within the state and must be narrowly tailored to effectively protect life or property without placing unnecessary restrictions on the ability for a person or persons, regardless of job type or classification, to work, provide for their families, or otherwise contribute to the economy of the state of Idaho.\n\n(2) A disaster emergency shall be declared by executive order or proclamation of the governor if he finds a disaster has occurred or that the occurrence or the threat thereof is imminent. The state of disaster emergency shall continue until the governor finds that the threat or danger has passed or the disaster has been dealt with to the extent that emergency conditions no longer exist, and when either or both of these events occur, the governor shall terminate the state of disaster emergency by executive order or proclamation; provided, however, that no state of disaster emergency may continue for longer than thirty (30) days unless the governor finds that it should be continued for another thirty (30) days or any part thereof. The legislature by concurrent resolution may terminate a state of disaster emergency at any time. Thereupon, the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation ending the state of disaster emergency. All executive orders or proclamations issued under this subsection shall indicate the nature of the disaster, the area or areas threatened, the area subject to the proclamation, and the conditions causing the disaster. An executive order or proclamation shall be disseminated promptly by means calculated to bring its contents to the attention of the general public and, unless the circumstances attendant upon the disaster prevent or impede, be promptly filed with the Idaho office of emergency management, the office of the secretary of state, and the office of the recorder of each county where the state of disaster emergency applies.\n\n(3) An executive order or proclamation of a state of disaster emergency shall activate the disaster response and recovery aspects of the state, local, and intergovernmental disaster emergency plans applicable to the political subdivision or area in question and be authority for the deployment and use of any forces to which the plan or plans apply and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, and materials and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available pursuant to this act or any other provision of law relating to disaster emergencies.\n\n(4) During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency, the governor is commander-in-chief of the militia and may assume command of all other forces available for emergency duty. To the greatest extent practicable, the governor shall delegate or assign command authority by prior arrangement embodied in appropriate executive orders or rules, but nothing herein restricts his authority to do so by orders issued at the time of the disaster emergency.\n\n(5) In addition to any other powers conferred upon the governor by law, he may:\n\n(a) Suspend the provisions of any rules prescribing the procedures for conduct of public business that would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency;\n\n(b) Utilize all resources of the state, including, but not limited to, those sums in the disaster emergency account as he shall deem necessary to pay obligations and expenses incurred during a declared state of disaster emergency;\n\n(c) Transfer the direction, personnel, or functions of state departments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency services;\n\n(d) Subject to any applicable requirements for compensation under section 46-1012, Idaho Code, and except as provided in subsection (7)(c) of this section, commandeer or utilize any private property, real or personal, if he finds this necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;\n\n(e) Direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area within the state if he deems this action necessary for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response, or recovery;\n\n(f) Prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation;\n\n(g) Control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein;\n\n(h) Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, explosives, and combustibles; and\n\n(i) Make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing.\n\n(6) Whenever an emergency or a disaster has been declared to exist in Idaho by the president under the provisions of the disaster relief act of 1974 (P.L. 93-288, 42 U.S.C. 5121), as amended, the governor may:\n\n(a) Enter into agreements with the federal government for the sharing of disaster recovery expenses involving public facilities;\n\n(b) Require as a condition of state assistance that a local taxing district be responsible for paying forty percent (40%) of the nonfederal share of costs incurred by the local taxing district that have been determined to be eligible for reimbursement by the federal government, provided that the total local share of eligible costs for a taxing district shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the taxing district’s tax charges authorized by section 63-802, Idaho Code;\n\n(c) Obligate the state to pay the balance of the nonfederal share of eligible costs within local taxing entities qualifying for federal assistance; and\n\n(d) Enter into agreements with the federal government for the sharing of disaster assistance expenses to include individual and family grant programs.\n\n(7) During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency, neither the governor nor any agency of any governmental entity or political subdivision of the state shall:\n\n(a) Impose or enforce any additional restrictions on the lawful manufacturing, possession, transfer, sale, transport, storage, display or use of firearms or ammunition or their components or accessories, or otherwise limit or suspend any rights guaranteed by the United States constitution or the constitution of the state of Idaho, including but not limited to the right to peaceable assembly or free exercise of religion.

The state of Idaho hereby enacts into law and enters into the interstate mutual aid compact with those states who agree and enact the interstate mutual aid compact in accordance with the terms of the compact, which compact is substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE MUTUAL AID COMPACT\n\nThe purpose of this compact is to provide voluntary assistance among participating states in responding to any disaster or imminent disaster that overextends the ability of local and state governments to reduce, counteract, or remove the danger. Assistance may include but is not limited to rescue, fire, police, medical, communication, and transportation services and facilities to cope with problems which require use of special equipment, trained personnel, or personnel in large numbers not locally available.\n\nArticle I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States permits a state to enter into an agreement or compact with another state, subject to the consent of Congress. Congress, through enactment of 50 U.S.C. 2281(g) and 2283 and the executive branch, by issuance of Executive Order No. 10186 of December 1, 1950, encourages the states to enter into emergency, disaster, and civil defense mutual aid agreements or pacts.\n\nArticle III\n\nIt is agreed by participating states that the following conditions will guide implementation of the compact:\n\n(1) Participating states through their designated officials are authorized to request and receive assistance from a participating state. Requests will be granted only if the requesting state is committed to the mitigation of the emergency and other resources are not immediately available.\n\n(2) Requests for assistance may be verbal or in writing. If the request is made by other than written communication, it must be confirmed in writing as soon as practical after the request. A written request shall provide an itemization of equipment and operators, types of expertise, and personnel or other resources needed. Each request must be signed by an authorized official.\n\n(3) Personnel and equipment of the aiding state made available to the requesting state shall, whenever possible, remain under the control and direction of the aiding state. The activities of personnel and equipment of the aiding state must be coordinated by the requesting state.\n\n(4) An aiding state has the right to withdraw some or all of its personnel and equipment whenever the personnel and equipment are needed by that state. Notice of intention to withdraw should be communicated to the requesting state as soon as possible.\n\n(1) The requesting state shall reimburse the aiding state as soon as possible after the receipt by the requesting state of an itemized voucher requesting reimbursement of costs.\n\n(2) Any state rendering aid pursuant to this compact must be reimbursed by the state receiving such aid for any damage to, loss of, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment used in responding to a request for aid, and for the cost incurred in connection with such requests.\n\n(3) Any state rendering aid pursuant to this compact must be reimbursed by the state receiving such aid for the cost of compensation and death benefits to injured officers, agents, or employees and their dependents or representatives if such officers, agents, or employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this arrangement and such payments are made in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within the aiding state.\n\n(1) All privileges and immunities from liability, exemptions from law, ordinances, and rules and all pension, disability relief, workers’ compensation, and other benefits that apply to the activity of officers, agents, or employees when performing their respective functions within the territorial limits of their respective political subdivisions apply to them to the same extent while engaged in the performance of any of their functions and duties extraterritorially under the provisions of this compact.\n\n(2) All privileges and immunities from liability, exemptions from law, ordinances, and rules and workers’ compensation and other benefits that apply to duly enrolled or registered volunteers when performing their respective functions at the request of their state and within its territorial limits apply to the same extent while performing their functions extraterritorially under the provisions of this compact. Volunteers may include but are not limited to physicians, surgeons, nurses, dentists, structural engineers, and trained search and rescue volunteers.\n\n(3) The signatory states, their political subdivisions, municipal or public corporations, and other public agencies shall hold harmless the corresponding entities and personnel thereof from the other states with respect to the acts and omissions of its own agents and employees that occur while providing assistance pursuant to the common plan.\n\n(4) Nothing of this arrangement may be construed as repealing or impairing any existing interstate mutual aid agreements.\n\n(5) Upon enactment of this compact by two (2) or more states, and annually by each January 1 thereafter, the participating states will exchange with each other the names of officials designated to request and provide services under this arrangement. In accordance with the cooperative nature of this arrangement, it is permissible and desirable for the states to exchange operational procedures to be followed in requesting assistance and reimbursing expenses.\n\n(6) This compact becomes effective and is binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two (2) states. Thereafter, this compact becomes effective and binding as to any other state upon similar action by such state.\n\n(7) This compact remains binding upon a party state until it enacts a law repealing the compact and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal may not take effect until the 30th consecutive day after the notice has been sent. Such withdrawal does not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed under this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n[46-1018, added 1986, ch. 107, sec. 2, p. 295.]",

      "text": "46-1018A. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT. The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby authorizes the governor of the state of Idaho to enter into a compact on behalf of the state of Idaho with any other state legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT\n\nPURPOSES AND AUTHORITIES\n\n(1) This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.\n\n(2) The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.\n\n(3) This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ national guard forces, either in accordance with the national guard mutual assistance compact or by mutual agreement between states.\n\nGENERAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n(1) Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.\n\n(2) The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.\n\n(3) On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nPARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n(1) It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:\n\n(a) Review individual state hazards analysis and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.\n\n(b) Review party states’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.\n\n(c) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.\n\n(d) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.\n\n(e) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.\n\n(f) Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.\n\n(g) Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.\n\n(2) The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:\n\n(a) A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.\n\n(b) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.\n\n(c) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party’s response and a point of contact at that location.\n\n(3) There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nAny party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the states in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency service authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training of mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.\n\nLICENSES AND PERMITS\n\nWhenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.\n\nOfficers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS\n\nInasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two (2) or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nEach party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.\n\nREIMBURSEMENT\n\nAny party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provisions of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two (2) or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.\n\nPlans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n(1) This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two (2) states; thereafter this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.\n\n(2) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty (30) days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n(3) Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nThis compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of the compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\nNothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the national guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the army or the air force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n[46-1018A, added 2001, ch. 140, sec. 1, p. 502.]",

As used in this act:\n\n(1) \"Development\" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to the construction of buildings, structures, or accessory structures or the construction of additions or substantial improvements to buildings, structures, or accessory structures; the placement of mobile homes; mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of materials; specifically including the construction of dikes, berms and levees.\n\n(2) \"Flood\" means a general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas caused by the overflow or rise of rivers, streams or lakes or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.\n\n(3) \"Flood fringe\" is that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by floodwaters during the regulatory flood.\n\n(4) \"Floodplain\" is the land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters or is surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible during the occurrence of the regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood fringe.\n\n(5) \"Floodplain management\" is the analysis and integration of the entire range of measures that can be used to prevent, reduce or mitigate flood damage in a given location and that can protect and preserve the natural, environmental, historical, and cultural values of the floodplain.\n\n(6) \"Floodproofing\" means the modifications of structures and their sites, building contents, and water and sanitary facilities to keep water out or reduce the effects of water entry.\n\n(7) \"Flood protection elevation\" means an elevation that shall correspond to the elevation of the one percent (1%) chance flood (one hundred (100) year flood), plus any increased flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any required freeboard.\n\n(8) \"Floodway\" is the channel of the river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge and store the floodwater or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.\n\n(9) \"Freeboard\" represents a factor of safety usually expressed in terms of a certain amount of feet above a calculated flood level. Freeboard shall compensate for the many unknown factors that contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated. These unknown factors include but are not limited to ice jams, debris accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the effects of urbanization on the hydrology of the watershed, loss of flood storage areas due to development and the sedimentation of a river or streambed.\n\n(10) \"Local government,\" in the context of this chapter, means any county or city having planning and zoning authority to regulate land use within its jurisdiction.\n\n(11) \"Mitigation\" means any action taken that will reduce the impact, damage or cost of the next flood that occurs.\n\n(12) \"Person\" means any individual, group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, political subdivision, public or private agency or entity.\n\n(13) \"Regulatory flood\" is a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Idaho and that may be expected to occur on a particular stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based on a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent (1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.\n\n[46-1021, added 1998, ch. 301, sec. 1, p. 993; am. 2010, ch. 141, sec. 1, p. 298; am. 2014, ch. 72, sec. 5, p. 187; am. 2024, ch. 179, sec. 1, p. 665.]",

Subject to the availability of adequate mapping and data to properly identify the floodplains, if any, within its jurisdiction, each local government is encouraged to adopt a floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance which identifies these floodplains and which requires, at a minimum, that any development in a floodplain must be constructed at a flood protection elevation and/or have adequate floodproofing. The local government may regulate all mapped and unmapped floodplains within its jurisdiction. Nothing in this act shall prohibit a local government from adopting more restrictive standards than those contained in this chapter. If not otherwise exempt from approval, a flood control district’s conduct of a \"flood fight,\" as defined in section 42-3103, Idaho Code, shall not require prior local government approval provided all such approvals are obtained within a reasonable time after the imminent flooding event has ended.\n\n[46-1022, added 1998, ch. 301, sec. 1, p. 994; am. 2010, ch. 141, sec. 2, p. 299; am. 2014, ch. 72, sec. 6, p. 188; am. 2024, ch. 179, sec. 2, p. 666.]",
