The \"Model State Code of Military Justice\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nMODEL STATE CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE\n\nPART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nARTICLE 1. DEFINITIONS — GENDER NEUTRALITY\n\n(a) In this act, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n(1) The term \"cadet,\" \"candidate,\" or \"midshipman\" means a person who is enrolled in or attending the United States military academy, the United States air force academy, the United States coast guard academy, officer candidate school, a state military academy, a regional training institute, or any other formal education program for the purpose of becoming a commissioned officer in the state military forces;\n\n(2) The term \"duty status other than state active duty\" means any other type of duty not in federal service and not full-time duty in the active service of the state, under an order issued by authority of law and includes travel to and from such duty;\n\n(3) The term \"judge advocate\" means a commissioned officer of the organized state military forces who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state and is:\n\n(A) Certified or designated as a judge advocate in the judge advocate general’s corps of the army, air force, navy, or the marine corps or designated as a law specialist as an officer of the coast guard, or a reserve component of one of these; or\n\n(B) Certified as a nonfederally recognized judge advocate, under regulations promulgated pursuant to this provision, by the senior judge advocate of the commander of the force in the state military forces of which the accused is a member, as competent to perform such military justice duties required by this code. If there is no such judge advocate available, then such certification may be made by such senior judge advocate of the commander of another force in the state military forces, as the convening authority directs;\n\n(4) \"State\" means one of the several states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands;\n\n(5) \"State active duty\" means full-time duty in the state military forces under an order of the governor or otherwise issued by authority of law, and paid by state funds, and includes travel to and from such duty;\n\n(6) \"Senior force judge advocate\" means the senior judge advocate of the commander of the same force of the state military forces as the accused and who is that commander’s chief legal advisor;\n\n(7) \"State military forces\" means the national guard of the state of Idaho, as defined in title 32, United States Code, the organized naval militia of the state, and any other military force organized under the constitution and laws of the state of Idaho, not to include the unorganized militia, when not in a status subjecting them to exclusive jurisdiction under 10 U.S.C. chapter 47. The unorganized militia, state defense force, state national guard, home guard or any other name of any state force that does not meet this definition shall not be part of the \"state military forces\" under this code;\n\n(8) \"Senior force commander\" means the commander of the same force of the state military forces as the accused;\n\n(9) \"Commanding officer\" means only commissioned officers;\n\n(10) \"Superior commissioned officer\" means a commissioned officer superior in rank, grade, or command;\n\n(11) \"Military\" means any or all of the state military forces;\n\n(12) \"Accuser\" means a person who signs and swears to charges, any person who directs that charges nominally be signed and sworn to by another, and any other person who has an interest other than an official interest in the prosecution of the accused;\n\n(13) \"Military judge\" means an official of a general or special court-martial detailed in accordance with article 26;\n\n(14) \"Legal officer\" means any commissioned officer designated as a judge advocate to perform legal duties for a command;\n\n(15) \"Record,\" when used in connection with the proceedings of a court-martial, means:\n\n(A) An official written transcript, written summary, or other writing relating to the proceedings; or\n\n(B) An official audiotape, videotape, or similar material from which sound, or sound and visual images, depicting the proceedings may be reproduced;\n\n(16) \"Classified information\" means:\n\n(A) Any information or material that has been determined by an official of the United States pursuant to law, an executive order, or regulation to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security; and\n\n(B) Any restricted data, as defined in section 11(y) of the atomic energy act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2014(y);\n\n(17) \"National security\" means the national defense and foreign relations of the United States;\n\n(18) \"Military offenses\" means those offenses prescribed under articles 77 through 117, 123, 124a, 124b, and 131b through 134.\n\n(b) The use of the masculine gender throughout this code shall also include the feminine gender.\n\nARTICLE 2. PERSONS SUBJECT TO THIS CODE — JURISDICTION\n\n(a) This code applies to all members of the state military forces when serving in a title 32 status or state active duty status as defined in article 1(a)(5) of this code. This code does not apply to members serving in a title 10 status or members of the unorganized militia as defined in section 46-102, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists between an offense, either military or nonmilitary, and the state military force, regardless of duty status. Courts-martial convened by the governor or his designated representative have primary jurisdiction of military offenses as defined in article 1(a)(18) of this code. A proper civilian court has primary jurisdiction of a nonmilitary offense when an act or omission violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.\n\nARTICLE 3. JURISDICTION TO TRY CERTAIN PERSONNEL\n\n(a) Subject to article 43, a person who is in a status in which the person is subject to this chapter and who committed an offense against this chapter while formerly in a status in which the person was subject to this chapter is not relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter for that offense by reason of a termination of that person’s former status.\n\n(b) Each person discharged from the state military forces who is later charged with having fraudulently obtained his discharge is, subject to article 43, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge and is, after apprehension, subject to this chapter while in the custody of the state military forces for that trial. Upon conviction of that charge, he is subject to trial by court-martial for all offenses under this chapter committed before the fraudulent discharge.\n\n(c) No person who has deserted from the state military forces may be relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter by virtue of a separation from any later period of service.\n\n(d) A member of the state military forces who is subject to this chapter is not, by virtue of the termination of a period of active duty for training or inactive-duty training, relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter for an offense against this chapter committed during such period of active duty or inactive-duty training.\n\nARTICLE 4. DISMISSED OFFICER’S RIGHT TO TRIAL BY COURT-MARTIAL\n\n(a) If any commissioned officer, dismissed by order of the governor or his designated representative, makes a written application for trial by court-martial, setting forth, under oath, that he has been wrongfully dismissed, the governor or his designated representative, as soon as practicable, shall convene a general court-martial to try that officer on the charges on which he was dismissed. A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and he shall be considered to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to any offense with which he is charged. The court-martial may, as part of its sentence, adjudge the affirmance of the dismissal, but if the court-martial acquits the accused or if the sentence adjudged, as finally approved or affirmed, the adjutant general shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the governor or his designated representative a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.\n\n(b) If the governor or his designated representative fails to convene a general court-martial within six (6) months from the presentation of an application for trial under this article, the adjutant general shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the governor or his designated representative a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.\n\n(c) If a discharge is substituted for a dismissal under this article, the governor or his designated representative alone may reappoint the officer to such commissioned grade and with such rank as, in the opinion of the governor or his designated representative, that former officer would have attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as the governor or his designated representative may direct. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right to pay and allowances.\n\n(d) If an officer is discharged from any armed force by administrative action or is dropped from the rolls by order of the governor or his designated representative, he has no right to trial under this article.\n\nARTICLE 5. TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE CODE\n\n(a) This code has applicability at all times and in all places subject to the personal jurisdiction as provided in article 2 of this code, or, if not in a duty status, that there is a nexus between the act or omission constituting the offense and the efficient functioning of the state military forces; however, this grant of military jurisdiction shall neither preclude nor limit civilian jurisdiction over an offense, which is limited only by the prohibition of double jeopardy.\n\n(b) Courts-martial and courts of inquiry may be convened and held in units of the state military forces while those units are serving outside the state with the same jurisdiction and powers as to persons subject to this code as if the proceedings were held inside the state, and offenses committed outside the state may be tried and punished either inside or outside the state.\n\nARTICLE 6. JUDGE ADVOCATES AND LEGAL OFFICERS\n\n(a) The senior force judge advocates in each of the state’s military forces or that judge advocate’s delegates shall make frequent inspections in the field in supervision of the administration of military justice in that force.\n\n(b) Convening authorities shall at all times communicate directly with their staff judge advocates or legal officers in matters relating to the administration of military justice. The staff judge advocate or legal officer of any command is entitled to communicate directly with the staff judge advocate or legal officer of a superior or subordinate command, or with the state judge advocate.\n\n(c)(1) No person who, with respect to a case, serves in a capacity specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, may later serve as a staff judge advocate or legal officer to any reviewing or convening authority upon the same case.\n\n(2) The capacities referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are, with respect to the case involved, any of the following:\n\n(A) Preliminary hearing officer, court member, military judge, military magistrate, or appellate judge; or\n\n(B) Counsel who have acted in the same case or appeared in any proceeding before a military judge, military magistrate, preliminary hearing officer, or appellate court.\n\nARTICLE 6a. INVESTIGATION AND DISPOSITION OF MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE FITNESS OF MILITARY JUDGES\n\n(a) The governor or his designee shall prescribe procedures for the investigation and disposition of charges, allegations, or information pertaining to the fitness of a military appellate judge, military judge, or military magistrate to perform the duties of the position involved.\n\n(b) The governor or his designee shall transmit a copy of the procedures prescribed pursuant to this article to the appropriate committees of the Idaho senate and Idaho house of representatives.\n\nARTICLE 6b. RIGHTS OF THE VICTIM OF AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS CODE\n\n(a) A victim of an offense under this code has the following rights:\n\n(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any of the following:\n\n(A) A public hearing concerning the continuation of confinement prior to trial of the accused;\n\n(B) A preliminary hearing under article 32 relating to the offense;\n\n(C) A court-martial relating to the offense;\n\n(D) A public proceeding of the service clemency and parole board relating to the offense; and\n\n(E) The release or escape of the accused, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.\n\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any public hearing or proceeding described in paragraph (2) of this subsection unless the military judge or preliminary hearing officer, as applicable, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim of an offense under this chapter would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that hearing or proceeding.\n\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any of the following:\n\n(A) A public hearing concerning the continuation of confinement prior to trial of the accused;\n\n(B) A sentencing hearing relating to the offense; and\n\n(C) A public proceeding of the service clemency and parole board relating to the offense.\n\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the counsel representing the government at any proceeding described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n\n(6) The right to receive restitution as provided in law.\n\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the dignity and privacy of the victim of an offense under this code.\n\n(b) In this article, \"victim of an offense under this code\" means an individual who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under this code.\n\n(c) In the case of a victim of an offense under this code who is under eighteen (18) years of age but who is not a member of the state military forces, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardians of the victim or the representatives of the victim’s estate, family members, or any other person designated as suitable by the military judge, may assume the rights of the victim under this article.\n\n(d) Enforcement by the Idaho state courts:\n\n(1) If the victim of an offense under this chapter believes that an article 32 preliminary hearing ruling or a court-martial ruling violates the rights of the victim afforded by the provisions of this article, including provisions specified in subsection (a)(4) of this article, the victim may petition the Idaho state courts in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure of the Idaho state courts for a writ of mandamus to require the preliminary hearing officer or the court-martial to comply with the provisions of this article.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies with respect to the protections afforded by the following:\n\n(A) The provisions of this article;\n\n(B) Military rule of evidence 513, relating to the psychotherapist-patient privilege;\n\n(C) Military rule of evidence 514, relating to the victim advocate-victim privilege; and\n\n(D) Military rule of evidence 615, relating to the exclusion of witnesses.\n\n(e) Upon notice by counsel for the government to counsel for the accused of the name of an alleged victim of an offense under this article who counsel for the government intends to call as a witness at a proceeding under this article, counsel for the accused shall make any request to interview the victim through the special victims’ counsel or other counsel for the victim, if applicable.\n\n(f) If requested by an alleged victim who is subject to a request for interview under subsection (e) of this article, any interview of the victim by counsel for the accused shall take place only in the presence of the counsel for the government, a counsel for the victim, or, if applicable, a victim advocate.\n\nPART II.

APPREHENSION\n\n(a) Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody.\n\n(b) Any person authorized by this code or by 10 U.S.C. chapter 47, or by regulations issued under either, to apprehend persons subject to this code, any marshal of a court-martial appointed pursuant to the provisions of this code, and any peace officer or civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders under the laws of the United States or of a state, including, but not limited to, section 46-1103, Idaho Code, may do so upon probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the person apprehended committed it.\n\n(c) Commissioned officers, warrant officers, petty officers, and noncommissioned officers have authority to quell quarrels, frays, and disorders among persons subject to this code and to apprehend persons subject to this code who take part therein.\n\n(d) If an offender is apprehended outside the state, the offender’s return to the area must be in accordance with normal extradition procedures or by reciprocal agreement.\n\n(e) No person authorized by this article to apprehend persons subject to this code or the place where such offender is confined, restrained, held, or otherwise housed may require payment of any fee or charge for so receiving, apprehending, confining, restraining, holding, or otherwise housing a person except as otherwise provided by law.\n\nARTICLE 8. APPREHENSION OF DESERTERS\n\nAny civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders under the laws of the United States or of a state, commonwealth, possession, or the District of Columbia may summarily apprehend a deserter from the state military forces and deliver him into the custody of those forces.\n\nARTICLE 9. IMPOSITION OF RESTRAINT\n\n(a) Arrest is the restraint of a person by an order, not imposed as a punishment for an offense, directing him to remain within certain specified limits. Confinement is the physical restraint of a person.\n\n(b) An enlisted member may be ordered into arrest or confinement by any commissioned officer by an order, oral or written, delivered in person or through other persons subject to this code. A commanding officer may authorize warrant officers, petty officers, or noncommissioned officers to order enlisted members of the commanding officer’s command or subject to the commanding officer’s authority into arrest or confinement.\n\n(c) A commissioned officer, a warrant officer, or a civilian subject to this code or to trial thereunder may be ordered into arrest or confinement only by a commanding officer to whose authority the person is subject, by an order, oral or written, delivered in person or by another commissioned officer. The authority to order such persons into arrest or confinement may not be delegated.\n\n(d) No person may be ordered into arrest or confinement except for probable cause.\n\n(e) This article does not limit the authority of persons authorized to apprehend offenders to secure the custody of an alleged offender until proper authority may be notified.\n\nARTICLE 10. RESTRAINT OF PERSONS CHARGED\n\n(a) In general.\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, any person subject to this chapter who is charged with an offense under this chapter may be ordered into arrest or confinement as the circumstances require.\n\n(2) When a person subject to this chapter is charged only with an offense that is normally tried by summary court-martial, the person ordinarily shall not be ordered into confinement.\n\n(b) Notification to accused and related procedures.\n\n(1) When a person subject to this chapter is ordered into arrest or confinement before trial, immediate steps shall be taken:\n\n(A) To inform the person of the specific offense of which the person is accused; and\n\n(B) To try the person or to dismiss the charges and release the person.\n\n(2) To facilitate compliance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, the governor or his designee shall prescribe regulations setting forth procedures relating to referral for trial, including procedures for prompt forwarding of the charges and specifications and, if applicable, the preliminary hearing report submitted under article 32.\n\nARTICLE 11.

CONFINEMENT WITH ENEMY PRISONERS PROHIBITED\n\nNo member of the state military forces may be placed in military confinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of the armed forces. This article shall not apply to confinement of state military forces in civilian confinement facilities.\n\nARTICLE 13. PUNISHMENT PROHIBITED BEFORE TRIAL\n\nNo person, while being held for trial or awaiting a verdict, may be subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges pending against the person, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed upon such person be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to ensure the person’s presence.\n\nARTICLE 14. DELIVERY OF OFFENDERS TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES\n\n(a) A person subject to this code accused of an offense against civil authority may be delivered, upon request, to the civil authority for trial or confinement.\n\n(b) When delivery under this article is made to any civil authority of a person undergoing sentence of a court-martial, the delivery, if followed by conviction in a civil tribunal, interrupts the execution of the sentence of the court-martial, and the offender after having answered to the civil authorities for the offense shall, upon the request of competent military authority, be returned to the place of original custody for the completion of the person’s sentence.\n\nPART III. NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT\n\nARTICLE 15. COMMANDING OFFICER’S NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT\n\n(a) Under such regulations as prescribed, any commanding officer (and for purposes of this article, officers-in-charge) may impose disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial pursuant to this article. The governor, the adjutant general, or an officer of a general or flag rank in command may delegate the powers under this article to a principal assistant who is a member of the state military forces.\n\n(b) Any commanding officer may impose upon enlisted members of the officer’s command:\n\n(1) An admonition;\n\n(2) A reprimand;\n\n(3) The withholding of privileges for not more than six (6) months;\n\n(4) The forfeiture of pay of not more than seven (7) days’ pay;\n\n(5) A fine of not more than seven (7) days’ pay;\n\n(6) A reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction;\n\n(7) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than fourteen (14) days, which need not be consecutive; and\n\n(8) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen (14) days, which need not be consecutive.\n\n(c) Any commanding officer of the grade of major or lieutenant commander, or above, may impose upon enlisted members of the officer’s command:\n\n(1) Any punishment authorized in subsection (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this article;\n\n(2) The forfeiture of not more than one-half (1/2) of one (1) month’s pay per month for two (2) months;\n\n(3) A fine of not more than one (1) month’s pay;\n\n(4) A reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be reduced more than two (2) pay grades;\n\n(5) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than forty-five (45) days, which need not be consecutive; and\n\n(6) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than sixty (60) days, which need not be consecutive.\n\n(d) The governor, the adjutant general, an officer exercising general court-martial convening authority, or an officer of a general or flag rank in command may impose:\n\n(1) Upon officers of the officer’s command:\n\n(A) Any punishment authorized in subsection (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) of this article; and\n\n(B) Arrest in quarters for not more than thirty (30) days, which need not be consecutive.\n\n(2) Upon enlisted members of the officer’s command:\n\n(A) Any punishment authorized in subsection (c) of this article.\n\n(e) Whenever any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, the total length of the combined punishment cannot exceed the authorized duration of the longest punishment in the combination, and there must be an apportionment of punishments so that no single punishment in the combination exceeds its authorized length under this article.\n\n(f) Except in the case of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment under this article may not be imposed on any member under this article if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment.\n\n(g) The officer who imposes the punishment, or the successor in command, may, at any time, suspend, set aside, mitigate, or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The officer also may:\n\n(1) Mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;\n\n(2) Mitigate arrest in quarters to restriction; or\n\n(3) Mitigate extra duties to restriction.\n\nThe mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.\n\n(h) A person punished under this article who considers the punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority within fifteen (15) days after the punishment is either announced or sent to the accused, as the commander may determine. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (g) of this article by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment, the authority that is to act on the appeal may refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.\n\n(i) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission and not properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial and, when so shown, it shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.\n\n(j) Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under this article, the forfeiture may apply to pay accruing before, on, or after the date that punishment is imposed.\n\n(k) Regulations may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this article and may prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.\n\nPART IV. COURT-MARTIAL JURISDICTION\n\nARTICLE 16. COURTS-MARTIAL CLASSIFIED\n\nThe three (3) kinds of courts-martial in the state military forces are:\n\n(1) General courts-martial, consisting of:\n\n(A) A military judge and not less than five (5) members; or\n\n(B) Only a military judge, if before the court is assembled the accused, knowing the identity of the military judge and after consultation with defense counsel, requests orally on the record or in writing a court composed only of a military judge and the military judge approves;\n\n(2) Special courts-martial, consisting of:\n\n(A) A military judge and not less than three (3) members; or\n\n(B) Only a military judge, if one has been detailed to the court, and the accused under the same conditions as those prescribed in subsection (1) (B) of this article so requests; and\n\n(3) Summary courts-martial, consisting of one (1) commissioned officer.\n\nARTICLE 17. JURISDICTION OF COURTS-MARTIAL IN GENERAL\n\nEach component of the state military forces has court-martial jurisdiction over all members of the particular component who are subject to this code. Additionally, the army and air national guard state military forces have court-martial jurisdiction over all members subject to this code.\n\nARTICLE 18. JURISDICTION OF GENERAL COURTS-MARTIAL\n\nSubject to article 17 of this code, general courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this code for any offense made punishable by this code and may, under such limitations as the governor may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this code.\n\nARTICLE 19. JURISDICTION OF SPECIAL COURTS-MARTIAL\n\nSubject to article 17 of this code, special courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this code for any offense made punishable by this code and may, under such limitations as the governor may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this code except dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for more than one (1) year, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds (2/3) pay per month, or forfeiture of pay for more than one (1) year.\n\nARTICLE 20.

If objection to trial by summary court-martial is made by an accused in the rank of E-7 or above, trial by special or general court-martial may be ordered, as may be appropriate. Members in the rank of E-6 and below do not have the right to reject trial before a summary court-martial. Summary courts-martial may, under such limitations as the governor may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this code except dismissal, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than one (1) month, restriction to specified limits for more than two (2) months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds (2/3) of one (1) month’s pay.\n\n(c) A summary court-martial is a noncriminal forum. A finding of guilty at a summary court-martial does not constitute a criminal conviction.\n\nARTICLE 21. RESERVED\n\nPART V. APPOINTMENT AND COMPOSITION OF COURTS-MARTIAL\n\nARTICLE 22.

FORMER JEOPARDY\n\n(a) No person may, without his consent, be tried a second time for the same offense.\n\n(b) No proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty by a court-martial upon any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this article until the finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has been fully completed.\n\n(c) (1) A court-martial with a military judge alone is a trial in the sense of this article if, without fault of the accused after introduction of evidence and before announcement of findings under article 53, the case is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion of the prosecution for failure of available evidence or witnesses.\n\n(2) A court-martial with a military judge and members is a trial in the sense of this article if, without fault of the accused after the members, having taken an oath as members under article 42 and after completion of challenges under article 41, are impaneled, and before announcement of findings under article 53, the case is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion of the prosecution for failure of available evidence or witnesses.\n\nARTICLE 45.

With respect to any charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification may be entered immediately without vote. This finding shall constitute the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn prior to announcement of the sentence, in which event the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.\n\n(c) Harmless error. A variance from the requirements of this article is harmless error if the variance does not materially prejudice the substantial rights of the accused.\n\nARTICLE 46.

In addition, the accused shall have the right to be represented by civilian or military counsel in the same manner as provided for in article 38(b).\n\n(c) Admissibility and use as evidence. A deposition order under subsection (a) of this article does not control the admissibility of the deposition in a court-martial or other proceeding under this chapter.

ADMISSIBILITY OF SWORN TESTIMONY FROM RECORDS OF COURTS OF INQUIRY\n\n(a) Use as evidence by any party. In any case not extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer, the sworn testimony, contained in the duly authenticated record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, of a person whose oral testimony cannot be obtained, may, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, be read in evidence by any party before a court-martial if the accused was a party before the court of inquiry and if the same issue was involved or if the accused consents to the introduction of such evidence.\n\n(b) Use of evidence by defense.

Sworn testimony that is recorded by audiotape, videotape, or similar method, and is contained in the duly authenticated record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, is admissible before a court-martial, military commission, court of inquiry, or military board, to the same extent as sworn testimony may be read in evidence before any such body under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this article.\n\nARTICLE 50a. DEFENSE OF LACK OF MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n(a) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.\n\n(b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this article and charge them to find the accused:\n\n(1) Guilty;\n\n(2) Not guilty; or\n\n(3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.\n\n(d) Subsection (c) of this article does not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only.

VOTING AND RULINGS\n\n(a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.\n\n(b) The military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in article 52 of this code, beginning with the junior in rank.\n\n(c) Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them:\n\n(1) That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;\n\n(2) That in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused must be acquitted;\n\n(3) That, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and\n\n(4) That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the state.\n\n(d) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this article do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request, find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.\n\nARTICLE 52. VOTES REQUIRED FOR CONVICTION, SENTENCING, AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n(a) In general. No person may be convicted of an offense in a general or special court-martial, other than:\n\n(1) After a plea of guilty under article 45(b);\n\n(2) By a military judge in a court-martial with a military judge alone, under article 16; or\n\n(3) In a court-martial with members under article 16, by the concurrence of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the members present when the vote is taken.\n\n(b) Level of concurrence required.\n\n(1) In general.

If the accused is convicted of an offense by general or special court-martial consisting of a military judge and members, and the accused elects sentencing by members under article 25, the members shall sentence the accused.\n\n(C) Sentence of the accused. The sentence determined pursuant to this paragraph constitutes the sentence of the accused.\n\n(2) Summary courts-martial. If the accused is convicted of an offense in a trial by summary court-martial, the court-martial shall sentence the accused.\n\nARTICLE 53a. PLEA AGREEMENTS\n\n(a) In general.\n\n(1) At any time before the announcement of findings under article 53, the convening authority and the accused may enter into a plea agreement with respect to such matters as the manner in which the convening authority will dispose of one (1) or more charges and specifications and limitations on the sentence that may be adjudged for one (1) or more charges and specifications.\n\n(2) The military judge of a general or special court-martial may not participate in discussions between the parties concerning prospective terms and conditions of a plea agreement.\n\n(b) Limitation on acceptance of plea agreements.

With respect to an offense:\n\n(1) The military judge may accept a plea agreement that provides for a sentence of bad-conduct discharge; and\n\n(2) Upon recommendation of the trial counsel, in exchange for substantial assistance by the accused in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the military judge may accept a plea agreement that provides for a sentence that is less than the mandatory minimum sentence for the offense charged.\n\n(d) Binding effect of plea agreement. Upon acceptance by the military judge of a general or special court-martial, a plea agreement shall bind the parties and the court-martial.\n\nARTICLE 54.

CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS PROHIBITED\n\nPunishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment may not be adjudged by a court-martial or inflicted upon any person subject to this code. The use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.\n\nARTICLE 56. SENTENCING\n\n(a) The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as prescribed by this code, but in no instance may a sentence exceed more than ten (10) years for a military offense, nor shall a sentence of death be adjudged. A conviction by general court-martial of any military offense for which an accused may receive a sentence of confinement for more than one (1) year is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a summary court-martial, all other military offenses are misdemeanors. Any conviction by a summary court-martial is not a criminal conviction.\n\n(b) The limits of punishment for violations of the punitive articles prescribed herein shall be the lesser of the sentences prescribed by the manual for courts-martial of the United States currently in effect, and the state manual for courts-martial, but in no instance shall any punishment exceed that authorized by this code.\n\n(c) Imposition of sentence.\n\n(1) In general. In sentencing an accused, a court-martial shall impose punishment that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to promote justice and to maintain good order and discipline in the state military forces, taking into consideration:\n\n(A) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the accused;\n\n(B) The impact of the offense on:\n\n(i) The financial, social, psychological, or medical well-being of any victim of the offense; and\n\n(ii) The mission, discipline, or efficiency of the command of the accused and any victim of the offense;\n\n(C) The need for the sentence:\n\n(i) To reflect the seriousness of the offense;\n\n(ii) To promote respect for the law;\n\n(iii) To provide just punishment for the offense;\n\n(iv) To promote adequate deterrence of misconduct;\n\n(v) To protect others from further crimes by the accused;\n\n(vi) To rehabilitate the accused; and\n\n(vii) To provide, in appropriate cases, the opportunity for retraining and return to duty to meet the needs of the service; and\n\n(D) The sentences available under this chapter.\n\n(2) Sentencing by military judge. In announcing the sentence in a general or special court-martial in which the accused is sentenced by a military judge alone under article 53, the military judge shall, with respect to each offense of which the accused is found guilty, specify the term of confinement, if any, and the amount of the fine, if any. If the accused is sentenced to confinement for more than one (1) offense, the military judge shall specify whether the terms of confinement are to run consecutively or concurrently.\n\n(3) Sentencing by members. In a general or special court-martial in which the accused has elected sentencing by members, the court-martial shall announce a single sentence for all of the offenses of which the accused was found guilty.\n\n(d) Appeal of sentence to the district court of the county where the court-martial is held.\n\n(1) With the approval of the senior force judge advocate concerned, the government may appeal a sentence, on the grounds that the sentence violates the law or the sentence is unreasonable.\n\n(2) An appeal under this subsection must be filed within forty-two (42) days after the date of entry of judgment.\n\nARTICLE 56a. RESERVED\n\nARTICLE 57. EFFECTIVE DATE OF SENTENCES\n\n(a) Execution of sentences. A court-martial sentence shall be executed and take effect as follows:\n\n(1) Forfeiture and reduction. A forfeiture of pay or allowances shall be applicable to pay and allowances accruing on and after the date on which the sentence takes effect. Any forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that is included in a sentence of a court-martial takes effect on the earlier of:\n\n(A) The date that is fourteen (14) days after the date on which the sentence is adjudged; or\n\n(B) In the case of a summary court-martial, the date on which the sentence is approved by the convening authority.\n\n(2) Confinement. Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.\n\n(3) Approval of dismissal. If, in the case of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, the sentence of a court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of the sentence providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by the secretary concerned or such undersecretary or assistant secretary as may be designated by the secretary concerned. In such a case, the secretary, undersecretary, or assistant secretary, as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part of the sentence, as the secretary sees fit. In time of war or national emergency, he may commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the duration of the war or emergency and six (6) months thereafter.\n\n(4) Completion of appellate review. If a sentence extends to dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, that part of the sentence extending to dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, may be executed in accordance with service regulations after completion of appellate review and, with respect to dismissal, approval under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, as appropriate.\n\n(5) Other sentences. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a general or special court-martial sentence is effective upon entry of judgment and a summary court-martial sentence is effective when the convening authority acts on the sentence.\n\n(b) Deferral of sentences.\n\n(1) In general. On application by an accused, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned may, in his sole discretion, defer the effective date of a sentence of confinement, reduction, or forfeiture. The deferment shall terminate upon entry of judgment or, in the case of a summary court-martial, when the convening authority acts on the sentence. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.\n\n(2) Deferral of certain persons sentenced to confinement. In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection to confinement, the convening authority may defer the service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of that person, until after the person has been permanently released to the state military forces by a state or foreign country referred to in that paragraph.\n\n(3) Covered persons. Paragraph (2) of this subsection applies to a person subject to this chapter who, while in the custody of a state or foreign country, is temporarily returned by that state or foreign country to the state military forces for trial by court-martial and, after the court-martial, is returned to that state or foreign country under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.\n\n(4) State defined. In this subsection, the term \"state\" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.\n\n(5) Deferral while review pending. In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person to confinement, but in which review of the case is pending, the secretary concerned may defer further service of the sentence to confinement while that review is pending.\n\n(c) Appellate review.\n\n(1) Completion of appellate review. Appellate review is complete under this article when a review under this code is completed or a review is completed by the Idaho state courts in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure of the Idaho state courts.\n\n(2) Completion as final judgment of legality of proceedings. The completion of appellate review shall constitute a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings.\n\nARTICLE 58. EXECUTION OF CONFINEMENT\n\n(a) A sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place authorized by this code.

      "text": "46-1103. ARREST. Arrest of members of the Idaho military not in federal service by members of the Idaho military while acting in their military capacity is prohibited, except in the following circumstances:\n\n(1) If any member fails or refuses to report to his appointed place of duty, his commanding officer in the rank of major or above is authorized to arrest or cause to be arrested such member and have him brought before the commanding officer at his unit or organization headquarters, whether such headquarters be located within or without the borders of the state. After such an arrest, the commanding officer is authorized to transport, or cause to be transported, such member to his appointed place of duty, whether within or without the borders of the state. Furthermore, if a commander, in the rank of major or above, finds that probable cause exists to believe that a minor offense has been committed by a member of his command, he may cause the member to be arrested and brought before him for the purpose of processing nonjudicial punishment under article 15 of the model state code of military justice as provided in section 46-1102, Idaho Code. If military personnel are not available for the purpose of making the arrest or if the officer ordering the arrest deems it advisable, he may issue a warrant to any sheriff or peace officer authorized to serve warrants of arrest, and such sheriff or peace officer shall serve such warrants of arrest immediately, whenever practicable, and make return thereof to the commanding officer issuing the warrant. Upon receipt of the notification of arrest, the commanding officer shall direct that the arrestee be retrieved and brought before him within a reasonable time. Warrants issued under this subsection shall be the equivalent of a misdemeanor warrant issued by a court of the state of Idaho.\n\n(2) If any member of the Idaho military has had charges preferred against him under this chapter, and the convening authority to whom the charges have been forwarded has found that probable cause exists that the offense was committed by the accused and that the incarceration of the accused pending court-martial is required because of special circumstances found to exist which warrant such incarceration, then the convening authority is authorized to arrest such member or cause him to be arrested and have him confined pending trial. If military personnel are not available for the purpose of making the arrest, or if the convening authority deems it advisable, he may issue a warrant to any sheriff or peace officer authorized to serve such warrant in the same manner as other warrants of arrest, and said sheriff or peace officer shall effect the arrest and hold the accused in the county jail of the county in which the arrest is effected. Upon receipt of the notification of arrest, in accordance with the provisions of section 46-1102, Idaho Code, the commanding officer may direct that the arrestee be retrieved and brought before him within a reasonable time. Warrants issued under this subsection shall be the equivalent of a felony warrant issued by a court of the state of Idaho.\n\n[46-1103, added 2015, ch. 268, sec. 2, p. 1120.]",
