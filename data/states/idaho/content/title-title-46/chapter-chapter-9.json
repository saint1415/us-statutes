A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n(c) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states.\n\n(d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(e) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(f) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(3) Dispute resolution.\n\n(a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.\n\n(b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\n(4) Enforcement.\n\n(a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n(b) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(c) The remedies in this section shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nSECTION XIV\n\nDATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR EMS PERSONNEL PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT\n\n(1) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.\n\n(2) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.\n\n(3) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n(a) A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n(b) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n(4) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.\n\n(5) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.\n\n[46-906, added 2025, ch. 95, sec. 1, p. 498.]",

      "text": "46-914. IDAHO TIME SENSITIVE EMERGENCY SYSTEM OF CARE — STATEMENT OF INTENT. Time sensitive emergencies, specifically blunt trauma injuries, strokes and heart attacks, were three (3) of the top five (5) causes of death in Idaho in 2011. Numerous studies throughout the United States have demonstrated that organized systems of care improve patient outcomes, thus reducing the frequency of preventable death and improving the functional status of the patient. The institute of medicine’s report \"Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point\" recommended improving the care of critical illness through regionalization by transporting critically ill patients to designated specialized care centers when appropriate. Early treatment and transfer when necessary will save the lives of Idahoans stricken with these emergency conditions. Trauma systems of care are well understood as they have existed in many other states for decades. It is the intent of the legislature, in sections 46-914 through 46-922, Idaho Code, to create an integrated and responsive system of care for Idaho citizens. The trauma component will serve as the initial framework in a deliberate, incremental implementation approach for a comprehensive system of care for time sensitive emergencies in Idaho. The time sensitive emergency system in Idaho is intended to be voluntary and inclusive. The system will be designed such that all facilities, and in particular critical access hospitals, have the opportunity to participate. No facility shall be excluded from receiving medically appropriate patients based solely on the facility’s decision of not seeking designation.\n\n[(46-914) 56-1024, added 2014, ch. 147, sec. 1, p. 403; am. and redesig. 2025, ch. 94, sec. 10, p. 456.]",

(1) There is hereby created a voluntary time sensitive emergency system within the division.\n\n(2) As used in sections 46-914 through 46-922, Idaho Code:\n\n(a) \"Confidential information\" means information that may identify a patient, health care facility, or health care practitioner.\n\n(b) \"Contractor\" means an individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity performing TSE registry services under a contractual agreement with the division.\n\n(c) \"Council\" means the Idaho time sensitive emergency system council.\n\n(d) \"De-identified information\" means records and information contained in the TSE registry, including compilations and analyses thereof, that do not contain information that might identify a patient, health care facility, or health care practitioner.\n\n(e) \"Heart attack\" means a STEMI, which is a common name for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, a more precise description of a type of heart attack that is caused by a prolonged period of blocked blood supply that affects a large area of the heart and has a substantial risk of death and disability calling for a quick response.\n\n(f) \"Hospital\" has the same meaning as in 42 CFR.\n\n(g) \"Stroke\" means an interruption of blood flow to the brain causing paralysis, slurred speech, or altered brain function usually caused by a blockage in a blood vessel that carries blood to the brain (ischemic stroke) or by a blood vessel bursting (hemorrhagic).\n\n(h) \"Trauma\" means the result of an act or event that damages, harms, or hurts a human being resulting in intentional or unintentional damage to the body resulting from acute exposure to mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical energy or from the absence of such essentials as heat or oxygen.\n\n(i) \"TSE\" means a time sensitive emergency, specifically trauma, stroke, or heart attack.\n\n(j) \"TSE registry\" means the population-based data system that provides ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information related to trauma, stroke, and heart attack for system improvement, prevention, and research activities. Elements in the registry shall describe the nature and scope of the injury, illness, or health condition and identify the incidence and prevalence of traumatic injury, illness or health condition, severity of injury, performance of out-of-hospital and hospital emergency medical systems, patient outcomes, and the impact of trauma, stroke, and heart attack on the health care system.\n\n(k) \"TSE system\" means the organized approach to treating injured patients that establishes and promotes standards for patient transportation, equipment, and information analysis for effective and coordinated TSE care. TSE systems represent a continuum of care that is fully integrated into the emergency medical services system and is a coordinated effort between out-of-hospital and hospital providers with the close cooperation of medical specialists in each phase of care. The focus is on prevention, coordination of acute care, and aggressive rehabilitation. Systems are designed to be inclusive of all patients with a TSE requiring acute care facilities, striving to meet the needs of the patient, regardless of the severity of injury, geographic location, or population density. A TSE system seeks to prevent injuries from happening and the reduction of death and disability when it does happen.\n\n[(46-915) 56-1026, added 2014, ch. 147, sec. 3, p. 403; am. and redesig. 2025, ch. 94, sec. 11, p. 457.]",
