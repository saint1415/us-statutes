(1) The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby finds:\n\n(a) That lack of sufficient employment opportunities in port districts seriously endangers the public health and welfare;\n\n(b) That there is a need to encourage the acquisition, construction, installation or equipping of economic development facilities which will increase or maintain employment opportunities in port districts;\n\n(c) That it is desirable to provide methods of financing the costs of acquiring, constructing, installing and equipping of economic development facilities which will increase or maintain employment opportunities in port districts; and\n\n(d) That the method of financing provided in this act is therefore in the public interest and serves a public purpose in protecting and promoting the health and welfare of the citizens of this state by encouraging the acquisition, construction, installation or equipping of economic development facilities to increase or maintain employment opportunities in port districts.\n\n(2) It is the purpose of this act to authorize port districts to finance, acquire, construct, install, equip, own, lease and sell economic development facilities located in port districts to be financed for, or to be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of to persons other than municipal corporations or other political subdivisions, to the end that port districts may be able to promote the health and welfare of the people of this state; it is not intended by this act that any port district shall itself be authorized to operate any industrial or commercial enterprise or any such economic development facilities.\n\n(3) This act shall be liberally construed to accomplish the intentions expressed herein.\n\n[70-2102, added 1981, ch. 228, sec. 1, p. 458.]",

Such revenue bonds may be executed and delivered by the port district at any time and from time to time in such amounts, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in fully registered form or in bearer form registrable either as to principal or interest or both, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such time or times and at such place or places whether within or without the state of Idaho and evidenced in such manner, may bear interest at such rate or rates per annum without regard to any interest rate limitation appearing in any other law, may be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of such officers of the port district, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the commission under which the revenue bonds shall be authorized to be issued. If deemed advisable by the commission there may be retained in the proceedings under which any such revenue bonds are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on any port district the right or option to redeem any such revenue bonds except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder may be sold at public or private sale for such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the commission, and the port district may pay, but solely and only from the proceeds of any such revenue bonds, all expenses, premiums, and commissions which the commission may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by any port district of one or more series of revenue bonds for one or more purposes under this act shall not preclude it from issuing other revenue bonds in connection with the same project or any other project or for any other purpose hereunder, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issue of revenue bonds. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the issuance of refunding bonds in such amount as the commission may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums, commissions, service fees and other expenses necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same project or separate projects or for any other purpose hereunder, and regardless of whether or not the revenue bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise. All such revenue bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto, if any, are hereby made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments.\n\n[70-2106, added 1981, ch. 228, sec. 1, p. 460.]",

The resolution under which the revenue bonds are authorized to be issued and any indenture executed as security for the revenue bonds may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the properties covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions thereof leased by the port district to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, including the designation of a trustee, which may be a bank or trust company, the principal place of business of which may be within or without the state of Idaho, all as the commission shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. The pledge of the revenues and receipts to pay the principal, interest and premium, if any, on revenue bonds issued hereunder shall be valid and binding from the time when the agreement or the proceedings creating such pledge became binding upon the port district. The revenues and receipts so pledged and thereafter received by the port district shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery of any lease, purchase agreement, financing agreement, note, debenture, bond or other obligation pursuant to which such revenues and receipts are payable to the port district, or any other act except that the proceedings or agreement by which such pledge is created shall be recorded in the records of the port district. The proceedings or agreement by which such pledge is created or a financing statement need not be filed or recorded under the uniform commercial code, or otherwise, except in the records of the port district as provided above. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding and shall have priority as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the port district, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of the revenue bonds issued hereunder shall continue effective until the principal, interest and premium, if any, on the revenue bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made. In the event of default in such payment or in any agreement of the port district made as a part of the contract under which the revenue bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds or in any indenture executed as security therefor, said payment or agreement may be enforced by suit, mandamus or the appointment of a receiver in equity, or any one or more of said remedies.\n\n[70-2108, added 1981, ch. 228, sec. 1, p. 462.]",
