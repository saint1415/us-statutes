(1) A declaration becomes operative when it is delivered to the principal’s physician or mental health treatment provider and remains valid until revoked.

The physician or provider shall continue to obtain the principal’s informed consent to all mental health treatment decisions if the principal is capable of providing informed consent or refusal.\n\n(2) Upon being presented with a declaration, a physician or other provider shall make the declaration a part of the principal’s medical record if a physician-patient relationship has previously been established. If no physician-patient relationship has previously been established, nothing in this statute, or rules adopted pursuant thereto, may be read to require the establishment of physician-patient relationship in contradiction to the existing requirements of reasonable medical practice. When acting under authority of a declaration, a physician or provider shall comply with it to the fullest extent possible consistent with reasonable medical practice, the availability of treatments requested, and applicable law. If the physician or other provider is unwilling at any time to comply with the declaration, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment consistent with the exercise of independent medical judgment by promptly notifying the principal and the agent and documenting the notification in the principal’s medical record.\n\n[66-605, added 1998, ch. 81, sec. 1, p. 289.]",

(1) An agent who has accepted the appointment in writing may make decisions about mental health treatment on behalf of the principal only when the principal is incapable.

This right of access does not waive any evidentiary privilege.\n\n(3) In exercising authority under the declaration, the agent has a duty to act consistently with the desires of the principal as expressed in the declaration. If the principal’s desires are not expressed in the declaration and not otherwise known by the agent, the agent has a duty to act in what the agent in good faith believes to be the best interest of the principal.\n\n(4) An agent is not subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability or professional disciplinary action for an action taken in good faith under a declaration for mental health treatment. The agent is not, as a result of acting in that capacity, personally liable for the cost of treatment provided to the principal.\n\n[66-606, added 1998, ch. 81, sec. 1, p. 289.]",

The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court, two (2) physicians that include a psychiatrist, or a physician and a professional mental health clinician believe that you are incapable of making treatment decisions. Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments.\n\n(2) You may also appoint a person as your agent to make these treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistent with your desires as stated in this document or, if your desires are not stated or otherwise made known to the agent, to act in a manner consistent with what the person in good faith believes to be in your best interest. For the appointment to be effective, the person you appoint must accept the appointment in writing. The person also has the right to withdraw from acting as your agent at any time.\n\n(3) This document will continue in effect until revoked. You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED INCAPABLE BY A COURT, TWO (2) PHYSICIANS THAT INCLUDE A PSYCHIATRIST, OR A PHYSICIAN AND A PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider.\n\n(4) If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you. This declaration will not be valid unless it is signed by two (2) qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present when you sign or acknowledge your signature.\n\n[66-613, added 1998, ch. 81, sec. 1, p. 290.]",
