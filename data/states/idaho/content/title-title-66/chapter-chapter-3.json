(1) Proceedings for the appointment of a guardian of a mentally ill person may be commenced by the filing of a written petition with a court of competent jurisdiction by a friend, relative, spouse or guardian of the proposed patient, by a licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, prosecuting attorney, or other public official of a municipality, county or of the state of Idaho, or by the director of any facility in which such patient may be.\n\n(2) The petition shall state the name and last known address of the proposed patient; the name and address of either the spouse, next of kin or friend of the proposed patient; whether a guardian of the proposed patient has been previously appointed under the laws of this or any other state and, if so, the name and address of the guardian and the circumstances of such appointment; and a precise statement showing that the proposed patient is mentally ill, that treatment is available for such illness, and that the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment.\n\n(3) Any such petition shall be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician or licensed clinical psychologist stating that the physician or psychologist has personally examined the proposed patient within the last fourteen (14) days and is of the opinion:\n\n(a) That the proposed patient is mentally ill;\n\n(b) That in the absence of treatment the immediate prognosis is for major distress of the proposed patient which will result in serious mental or physical deterioration of the proposed patient;\n\n(c) That treatment is available which is likely to avoid serious mental or physical deterioration of the proposed patient; and\n\n(d) That the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment; or by a written statement by the physician or psychologist that the proposed patient has refused to submit to an examination.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of a petition, the court shall within forty-eight (48) hours appoint a senior designated examiner to make a personal examination of the proposed patient, or if the proposed patient has not been examined, the court shall appoint two (2) senior designated examiners to make individual personal examinations of the proposed patient and may order the proposed patient to submit to an immediate examination. Within seventy-two (72) hours of the signing of the order for involuntary hospitalization, the senior designated examiner shall examine the patient and file with the court certificates described in subsection (3) of this section, if necessary.\n\n(5) Upon receipt of such petition and certificates, the court shall appoint a time and place for hearing not more than five (5) days from receipt of such certificates and thereupon give written notice to the proposed patient. The notice shall include a copy of the petition and certificates and notice of the proposed patient’s right to be represented by an attorney, or if indigent, to be represented by a court-appointed attorney. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall also be given to the petitioner.\n\n(6) An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to every proposed patient, and if neither the proposed patient nor others provide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) The hearing shall be held in a manner and at a suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the proposed patient’s physical or mental health.\n\n(8) The proposed patient and the petitioner shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. At the hearing, any existing provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between the examining senior designated examiner and the proposed patient shall not apply and the senior designated examiner who examined the proposed patient shall be a competent witness to testify as to the proposed patient’s condition. The proposed patient shall be required to be present at the hearing, and be free from drugs likely to impair the proposed patient’s ability to communicate with counsel or understand the proceedings, unless the right to be present or free from drugs is knowingly and voluntarily waived by the patient or unless the presence of the patient at the hearing would unduly disrupt the judicial proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly procedure and the rules of evidence.\n\n(9)(a) The court shall appoint a person other than the treating professional to act in the proposed patient’s best interest with authority to consent to treatment, if, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(i) The proposed patient has a severe and reliably diagnosable mental illness;\n\n(ii) Without treatment, the immediate prognosis is for major distress resulting in serious mental or physical deterioration of the proposed patient;\n\n(iii) Treatment is available for such illness;\n\n(iv) The proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment; and\n\n(v) The relative risks and benefits of treatment or nontreatment are such that a reasonable person would consent to treatment.\n\n(b) The court shall consider appointing persons to give consent in the following priority: the proposed patient’s spouse, next of kin, friend or if the proposed patient’s spouse, next of kin or friend are unable or unwilling, another appropriate person not associated with the facility where the person is being, or shall be treated.\n\n(10) The appointed person shall have authority to consent to treatment, including treatment at a facility. Upon approval of the court, the appointed person may pay the costs of treatment from the patient’s money and tangible property deliverable to or received by the patient during the period of the appointed person’s authority, and may apply for any benefits to which the patient is entitled. In the exercise of his powers, the appointed person is to act as a fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees as described by section 15-7-302, Idaho Code. The appointment shall continue for a period of seven (7) weeks or until the court determines that the patient no longer lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, whichever is shorter.\n\n(11) Upon petition of the appointed person, authority to consent may be continued for an additional seven (7) week period, if the court again enters the findings required by subsection (9) of this section. The petition for continued authority shall be accompanied by the certificate of the treating professional meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. The petition for continued authority and physician’s certificate shall be served upon the patient and the patient’s attorney. If the proposed patient objects to the continued authority, the court shall conduct a hearing, following notice of the time and place of such hearing to the petitioner, the proposed patient and the proposed patient’s attorney.\n\n(12) Proceedings for appointment of a person with authority to consent under this section may be consolidated with proceedings for the involuntary care of the proposed patient under section 66-329, Idaho Code, provided, however, that appointment of a person with authority to consent under this section shall terminate the proceedings for the involuntary care under section 66-329, Idaho Code.\n\n(13) No more than two (2) petitions with authority to consent shall be granted under subsection (9) of this section within any twelve (12) month period, provided that other proceedings under this chapter or the Uniform Probate Code shall be permitted.\n\n(14) The person with authority to consent appointed pursuant to this section shall not be personally responsible for the cost of care or treatment rendered the mentally ill individual, simply by reason of the authority granted by this section.\n\n[66-322, added 1981, ch. 114, sec. 13, p. 178; am. 2022, ch. 93, sec. 5, p. 265.]",

During the precommitment period, the department shall:\n\n(a) Use the state-approved fee determination form and sliding fee schedule described in rules promulgated by the department to determine the person’s ability to pay;\n\n(b) Inquire to determine if the person has insurance, including medical assistance provided under the state plan for medicaid as authorized by title XIX of the social security act, as amended; and\n\n(c) Report its findings to the court.\n\n(3) The court may order a person to pay costs consistent with this section.\n\n(4) To the extent possible, psychiatric costs and the costs of routine and extraordinary medical care incurred during precommitment and commitment periods shall be assigned to a person’s health insurance, including medical assistance provided under the state plan for medicaid as authorized by title XIX of the social security act, as amended.

(1) Proceedings for the involuntary care and treatment of mentally ill persons by the department of health and welfare may be commenced by the filing of a written application with a court of competent jurisdiction by a friend, relative, spouse or guardian of the proposed patient, by a licensed physician, by a physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse practicing in a hospital, by a prosecuting attorney or other public official of a municipality, county or of the state of Idaho, or by the director of any facility in which such patient may be.\n\n(2) The application shall state the name and last known address of the proposed patient; the name and address of the spouse, guardian, next of kin, or friend of the proposed patient; whether the proposed patient can be cared for privately in the event commitment is not ordered; whether the proposed patient is, at the time of the application, a voluntary patient; whether the proposed patient has applied for release pursuant to section 66-320, Idaho Code; and a simple and precise statement of the facts showing that the proposed patient is mentally ill and either likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness.\n\n(3) Any such application shall be accompanied by a certificate of a designated examiner stating that he has personally examined the proposed patient within the last fourteen (14) days and is of the opinion that the proposed patient is: (i) mentally ill; (ii) likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness; and (iii) lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment;\n\nor a written statement by the applicant that the proposed patient has refused to submit to examination by a designated examiner.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of an application for commitment, the court shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, appoint another designated examiner to make a personal examination of the proposed patient, or if the proposed patient has not been examined, the court shall appoint two (2) designated examiners to make individual personal examinations of the proposed patient and may order the proposed patient to submit to an immediate examination. If neither designated examiner is a physician, the court shall order a physical examination of the proposed patient. At least one (1) designated examiner shall be a senior designated examiner. The designated examiners shall report to the court their findings within the following seventy-two (72) hours as to the mental condition of the proposed patient and his need for custody, care, or treatment by a facility. The reports shall be in the form of written certificates that shall be filed with the court. The court may terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application without taking any further action in the event the reports of the designated examiners are to the effect that the proposed patient is not mentally ill or, although mentally ill, is not likely to injure himself or others or is not gravely disabled due to mental illness. If the proceedings are terminated, the proposed patient shall be released immediately.\n\n(5) If the designated examiner’s certificate states a belief that the proposed patient is mentally ill and either likely to injure himself or others or is gravely disabled due to mental illness, the judge of such court shall issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or director of a facility to take the proposed patient to a facility in the community in which the proposed patient is residing or to the nearest facility to await the hearing, and for good cause may authorize treatment during such period subject to the provisions of section 66-346(a)(4), Idaho Code. Under no circumstances shall the proposed patient be detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or convicted of penal offenses.\n\n(6) Upon receipt of such application and designated examiners’ reports, the court shall appoint a time and place for a hearing not more than seven (7) days from the receipt of such designated examiners’ reports and thereupon give written notice of such time and place of such hearing, together with a copy of the application, designated examiner’s certificates, and notice of the proposed patient’s right to be represented by an attorney or, if indigent, to be represented by a court-appointed attorney, to the applicant, to the proposed patient, to the proposed patient’s spouse, guardian, next of kin, or friend. With the consent of the proposed patient and his attorney, the hearing may be held immediately. Upon motion of the petitioner, or upon motion of the proposed patient and attorney, and for good cause shown, the court may continue the hearing up to an additional seven (7) days during which time, for good cause shown, the court may authorize treatment.\n\n(7) An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to every proposed patient, and, if neither the proposed patient nor others provide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code, no later than the time the application is received by the court.\n\n(8) If the involuntary detention was commenced under this section, the hearing shall be held in a manner and at a suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the proposed patient’s physical or mental health. Venue for the hearing shall be in the county of residence of the proposed patient or in the county where the proposed patient was found immediately prior to commencement of such proceedings.\n\n(9) In all proceedings under this section, any existing provision of the law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between the designated examiner and proposed patient shall not apply and any designated examiner who shall have examined the proposed patient shall be a competent witness to testify as to the proposed patient’s condition.\n\n(10) The proposed patient, the applicant, and any other persons to whom notice is required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. The proposed patient may, after consulting with his attorney, waive his presence at court. The court may waive the presence of a proposed patient if the mental or physical state of the proposed patient is such that his presence at the hearing would be detrimental to the proposed patient’s health or would unduly disrupt the proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly procedure. The court shall receive all relevant and material evidence consistent with the rules of evidence.\n\n(11) If, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record, and after consideration of reasonable alternatives including, but not limited to, holding the proceedings in abeyance for a period of up to thirty (30) days, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed patient:\n\n(a) Is mentally ill; and\n\n(b) Is, because of such condition, likely to injure himself or others, or is gravely disabled due to mental illness;\n\nthe court shall order the proposed patient committed to the custody of the department director for observation, care, and treatment for an indeterminate period of time not to exceed one (1) year. The department director, through his dispositioner, shall determine within twenty-four (24) hours the least restrictive available facility or outpatient treatment, consistent with the needs of each patient committed under this section for observation, care, and treatment.\n\n(12) The commitment order constitutes a continuing authorization for the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a facility, upon request of the director of the outpatient facility, the physician, or the department director through his dispositioner, to transport a committed patient to designated outpatient treatment for the purpose of making reasonable efforts to obtain the committed patient’s compliance with the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment. If the director of the outpatient facility, the treating physician, or the department director through his dispositioner determines any of the following:\n\n(a) The patient is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment or the patient refuses outpatient treatment after reasonable efforts at compliance have been made; or\n\n(b) Outpatient treatment is not effective after reasonable efforts have been made;\n\nthe department director through his dispositioner shall cause the committed patient to be transported by the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a facility to the least restrictive available facility for observation, care, and treatment on an inpatient basis.

The court shall conduct an ex parte review of the notice and affidavit within forty-eight (48) hours of filing and determine whether the change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment at a facility is supported by probable cause. In no event shall the calculation of forty-eight (48) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that probable cause exists, the department director through his dispositioner shall continue with care and treatment on an inpatient basis at the least restrictive available facility. Within twenty-four (24) hours of a finding of probable cause, the court shall issue an order to show cause why the patient does not meet the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection. The order shall be served on the committed patient, the committed patient’s attorney and the committed patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend. The patient shall have fifteen (15) days to present evidence that the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection have not been met. In no event shall the calculation of twenty-four (24) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that a change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment does not meet the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the department director through his dispositioner will continue with outpatient treatment on the same or modified terms and conditions. Nothing provided in this section shall limit the authority of any law enforcement officer to detain a patient pursuant to the emergency authority conferred by section 66-326, Idaho Code.\n\n(13) Nothing in this chapter or in any rule adopted pursuant thereto shall be construed to authorize the detention or involuntary admission to a hospital or other facility of an individual who:\n\n(a) Has a neurological disorder, a neurocognitive disorder, a developmental disability as defined in section 66-402, Idaho Code, a physical disability, or any medical disorder that includes psychiatric symptomology or is primarily impaired by substance use, unless in addition to such condition, such person is mentally ill;\n\n(b) Is a patient under treatment by spiritual means alone, through prayer, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner thereof and who asserts to any authority attempting to detain him that he is under such treatment and who gives the name of a practitioner so treating him to such authority; or\n\n(c) Can be cared for privately with the help of willing and able family or friends in such a way as to no longer present substantial risk to himself or others, provided that such person may be detained or involuntarily admitted if such person is mentally ill and presents a substantial risk of injury to himself or others if such care is not adequate.\n\n(14) The order of commitment shall state whether the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, the name and address of the patient’s attorney and the patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend.\n\n(15) If the patient has no spouse or guardian and if the patient has property that may not be cared for pursuant to chapter 5, title 66, Idaho Code, or by the patient while confined at a facility, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the purpose of preserving the patient’s estate, pending further guardianship or conservatorship proceedings.\n\n(16) The commitment shall continue until terminated and shall be unaffected by the patient’s conditional release or change in disposition.\n\n[66-329, added 1951, ch. 290, sec. 13, p. 622; am. 1953, ch. 264, sec. 1, p. 455; am. 1959, ch. 207, sec. 7, p. 439; am. 1969, ch. 143, sec. 1, p. 461; am. 1972, ch. 44, sec. 3, p. 67; am. 1973, ch. 173, sec. 9, p. 363; am. 1974, ch. 165, sec. 8, p. 1405; am. 1981, ch. 114, sec. 18, p. 182; am. 1991, ch. 210, sec. 2, p. 495; am. 1998, ch. 78, sec. 1, p. 279; am. 1998, ch. 341, sec. 2, p. 1090; am. 2003, ch. 249, sec. 3, p. 645; am. 2008, ch. 331, sec. 3, p. 912; am. 2010, ch. 235, sec. 56, p. 594; am. 2013, ch. 293, sec. 3, p. 772; am. 2019, ch. 244, sec. 1, p. 739; am. 2021, ch. 9, sec. 1, p. 10; am. 2022, ch. 93, sec. 10, p. 271.]",

Whenever a patient is transferred, written notice thereof shall be given to the patient’s attorney, either the patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin or friend and the committing court.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of a certificate of an agency of any other state or private facility in any state, that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any patient committed or otherwise being cared for and treated pursuant to this chapter and that the patient is eligible for care or treatment in a facility of such agency, or if the patient or his next of kin or his guardian wish to have him cared for in some other facility, the department director or his designee may transfer him to such facility for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the patient’s attorney, either the patient’s spouse, guardian, adult next of kin or friend and the committing court shall be immediately notified of such transfer.

(1) The department director or his designee shall as frequently as practicable but at least once at the end of the first ninety (90) days examine or cause to be examined every patient committed to his custody or admitted to an inpatient facility of the state of Idaho, and determine whether to conditionally release, discharge or terminate the commitment of the patient. If the patient has not been conditionally released, discharged, or had the commitment terminated a similar review shall be conducted every one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter. A report of each review and determination regarding an involuntary patient shall be sent to the committing court, prosecuting attorney of the county of commitment, if any, the patient’s attorney, and either the patient’s spouse, guardian, next of kin or friend.\n\n(2) The commitment of an involuntary patient shall be terminated if the patient no longer meets criteria under section 66-329, Idaho Code; provided, that patients admitted under section 18-214, Idaho Code, acquitted of criminal charges filed prior to July 1, 1982, on grounds of mental disease or defect, or committed pursuant to sections 18-212(4) and 66-329, Idaho Code, as unfit to proceed, may not be released from an inpatient facility unless seven (7) days before such release, the department director or his designee shall notify the committing court and prosecuting attorney of the contemplated release.\n\n(3) Upon notification of intention to release from an inpatient facility either a patient admitted under section 18-214, Idaho Code, acquitted of criminal charges filed prior to July 1, 1982, on grounds of mental disease or defect, or committed pursuant to sections 18-212(4) and 66-329, Idaho Code, as unfit to proceed, and upon motion of an interested party or the court on its own motion, the court shall determine whether the conditions justifying such release exist. In making such determination, the court may order an independent examination of the patient. The cost of such independent examination must be borne by the party making the motion or, if indigent, the county having jurisdiction of the case. If no motion is made, the patient may be released according to the notice.\n\n(4) Section 18-214, Idaho Code, shall remain in full force and effect for every individual previously acquitted pursuant to section 18-213, Idaho Code.

Commitment of acquitted defendant — Conditional release — Revocation of release within five years. (1) When a defendant is acquitted on the ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court shall order him to be committed to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare to be placed in an appropriate institution for custody, care and treatment.\n\n(2) If the director of the department of health and welfare is of the view that a person committed to his custody, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this section, may be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or to others, he shall make application for the discharge or release of such person in a report to the court by which such person was committed and shall transmit a copy of such application and report to the prosecuting attorney of the county from which the defendant was committed. The court shall thereupon appoint at least two (2) qualified psychiatrists to examine such person and to report within sixty (60) days, or such longer period as the court determines to be necessary for the purpose, their opinion as to his mental condition. To facilitate such examination and the proceedings thereon, the court may cause such person to be confined in any institution located near the place where the court sits, which may hereafter be designated by the director of the department of health and welfare as suitable for the temporary detention of irresponsible persons.\n\n(3) If the court is satisfied by the report filed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this section and such testimony of the reporting psychiatrists as the court deems necessary that the committed person may be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or others, the court shall order his discharge or his release on such conditions as the court determines to be necessary. If the court is not so satisfied, it shall promptly order a hearing to determine whether such person may safely be discharged or released. Any such hearing shall be deemed a civil proceeding and the burden shall be upon the committed person to prove that he may safely be discharged or released. According to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the committed person shall thereupon be discharged or released on such conditions as the court determines to be necessary, or shall be recommitted to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, subject to discharge or release only in accordance with the procedure prescribed above for a first hearing.\n\n(4) If, within five (5) years after the conditional release of a committed person, the court shall determine, after hearing evidence, that the conditions of release have not been fulfilled and that for the safety of such person or for the safety of others his conditional release should be revoked, the court shall forthwith order him to be recommitted to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare subject to discharge or release only in accordance with the procedure prescribed above for a first hearing.\n\n(5) A committed person may make application for his discharge or release to the court by which he was committed, and the procedure to be followed upon such application shall be the same as that prescribed above in the case of an application by the director of the department of health and welfare. However, no such application by a committed person need be considered until he has been confined for a period of not less than six (6) months from the date of the order of commitment and if the determination of the court be adverse to the application, such person shall not be permitted to file a further application until one (1) year has elapsed from the date of any preceding hearing on an application for his release or discharge.\n\n(6) If a defendant escapes from custody during his confinement, the director shall immediately notify the court from which committed, the prosecuting attorney and the sheriff of the county from which committed. The court shall forthwith issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or the director of the institution from which the defendant escaped, to take the defendant into custody and immediately return him to his place of confinement.\n\n[66-337, added 1951, ch. 290, sec. 21, p. 622; am. 1959, ch. 207, sec. 13, p. 439; am. 1973, ch. 173, sec. 17, p. 363; am. 1974, ch. 165, sec. 14, p. 1405; am. 1981, ch. 114, sec. 25, p. 189; am. 1982, ch. 368, sec. 13, p. 926; am. 1987, ch. 59, sec. 2, p. 106; am. 2000, ch. 234, sec. 3, p. 659.; am. 2022, ch. 93, sec. 12, p. 275.]",

A copy of the petition for relief shall also be served on the director of the department of health and welfare and the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the original order, appointment or finding occurred, and such department and office may, as it deems appropriate, appear, support, object to and present evidence relevant to the relief sought by the petitioner. The court shall receive and consider evidence, including evidence offered by the petitioner, concerning:\n\n(a) The circumstances of the original order, appointment or finding;\n\n(b) The petitioner’s mental health and criminal history records, if any;\n\n(c) The petitioner’s reputation; and\n\n(d) Changes in the petitioner’s condition or circumstances relevant to the relief sought.\n\nThe court shall grant the petition for relief if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest. The petitioner may appeal a denial of the requested relief, and review on appeal shall be de novo. A person may file a petition for relief under this section no more than once every two (2) years.\n\n(3) When a court issues an order granting a petition for relief under subsection (2) of this section, the clerk of the court shall immediately forward a copy of the order to the Idaho state police, which in turn shall immediately forward a copy to the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency, for inclusion in the national instant criminal background check system database.\n\n[66-356, added 2010, ch. 267, sec. 1, p. 674.]",
