      "text": "18-8801. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Abortion\" means the use of any means to intentionally terminate the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman with knowledge that the termination by those means will, with reasonable likelihood, cause the death of the preborn child. \"Abortion\" does not mean the use of an intrauterine device or birth control pill to inhibit or prevent ovulations, fertilization, or the implantation of a fertilized ovum within the uterus.\n\n(2) \"Fetal heartbeat\" means embryonic or fetal cardiac activity or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac.\n\n(3) \"Fetus\" and \"preborn child\" each mean an individual organism of the species Homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.\n\n(4) \"Gestational age\" means the age of a preborn human individual as calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period of a pregnant woman.\n\n(5) \"Medical emergency\" means a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\n\n[(18-8801) 18-8701, added 2021, ch. 289, sec. 1, p. 867; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 10, p. 372; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 152, sec. 1, p. 532.]",

      "text": "18-8802. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The legislature finds and declares that:\n\n(1) The life of each human being begins at fertilization, and preborn children have interests in life, health, and well-being that should be protected.\n\n(2) The cardiopulmonary definition of death, which is the reigning common law standard for determining death, is defined as the \"irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions.\" This cardiopulmonary definition of death was included in the uniform determination of death act, a model law that was adopted by numerous medical and ethics organizations, including the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws, the American medical association, and almost all states in the United States.\n\n(3) Legal standards and the medical community at large both affirm that a consistent human heartbeat, independent of life support, is a core determining factor in establishing the legal presence of human life in a full range of circumstances, for old and young alike.\n\n(4) The heartbeat of a preborn child begins at a biologically identifiable moment in time that can be detected and imaged by medical equipment.\n\n(5) A detectable fetal heartbeat and its characteristics is a key medical predictor in whether a preborn child will reach live birth.\n\n(6) The fetal heartbeat, when detected, presents a clearly identifiable point at which the preborn child in the womb has a greater than ninety-five percent (95%) chance of survival when carried to term.\n\n(7) The presence of a human heartbeat is a more reliable indicator of life than the medically uncertain concept of \"viability\" and whether that preborn child is \"potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb.\"\n\n(8) Therefore, the state of Idaho has a compelling interest in protecting the life of a preborn child at all stages of its development, including after the preborn child has a detectable heartbeat, which signals rhythmically and without pause the presence of a precious and unique life, one that is independent and distinct from the mother’s and one that is also worthy of our utmost protection.\n\n[(18-8802) 18-8702, added 2021, ch. 289, sec. 1, p. 867; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 10, p. 372; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 152, sec. 2, p. 533.]",

Any person who intends to perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman must determine if there is the presence of any fetal heartbeat, except in the case of a medical emergency. In testing for any fetal heartbeat, the person conducting the physical examination on the pregnant woman must determine in his reasonable medical judgment and according to standard medical practice whether or not any fetal heartbeat is present. The person who determines the presence or absence of any fetal heartbeat must record in the pregnant woman’s medical record the estimated gestational age of the preborn human individual or individuals, the method used to test for the fetal heartbeat, the date and time of the test, and the results of the test.\n\n[(18-8803) 18-8703, added 2021, ch. 289, sec. 1, p. 868; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 10, p. 373; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 153, sec. 2, p. 536.]",

In the case of rape or incest:\n\n(a) If the woman is not a minor or subject to guardianship, then, prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman has reported the act of rape or incest to a law enforcement agency and provided a copy of such report to the physician who is to perform the abortion; or\n\n(b) If the woman is a minor or subject to guardianship, then, prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman or her parent or guardian has reported the act of rape or incest to a law enforcement agency or child protective services and a copy of such report have been provided to the physician who is to perform the abortion.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section recognizes a right to abortion before a fetal heartbeat is detected.\n\n[(18-8804) 18-8704, added 2021, ch. 289, sec. 1, p. 868; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 10, p. 373; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 124, sec. 19, p. 452; am. and redesig. 2022, ch. 152, sec. 3, p. 533.]",
