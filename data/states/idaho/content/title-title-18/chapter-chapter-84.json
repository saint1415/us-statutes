      "text": "18-8402. FINDINGS. The legislature finds that juvenile sex offenders present a significant risk of reoffense and that efforts of law enforcement agencies to protect communities, conduct investigations and quickly apprehend offenders who commit sex offenses are impaired by the lack of information available about individuals who have been convicted or adjudicated delinquent of sex offenses who live within their jurisdiction. The legislature further finds that providing public access to certain information about sex offenders assists parents in the protection of their children. Further, such access provides a means for organizations that work with youth or other vulnerable populations to prevent juvenile sex offenders from threatening those served by the organizations. Finally, public access assists the public to be observant of convicted juvenile sex offenders in order to prevent the offenders from recommitting sex crimes. Therefore, this state’s policy is to assist efforts of local law enforcement agencies to protect communities by requiring juvenile sex offenders to register with local law enforcement agencies and to make certain information about juvenile sex offenders available to the public as provided in this chapter.\n\n[18-8402, added 1998, ch. 412, sec. 1, p. 1299.]",
