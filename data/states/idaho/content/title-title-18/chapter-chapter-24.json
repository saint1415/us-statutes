(1) Conduct denominated theft in this chapter constitutes a single offense superceding the separate offenses previously known as embezzlement, extortion, false pretenses, cheats, misrepresentations, larceny and receiving stolen goods.\n\n(2) An accusation of theft may be supported by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be theft under this chapter, notwithstanding the specification of a different manner in the indictment, information or complaint, subject only to the power of the court to ensure fair trial by granting a continuance or other appropriate relief where the conduct of the defense would be prejudiced by lack of fair notice or by surprise.\n\n[18-2401, added 1981, ch. 183, sec. 2, p. 319.]",

      "text": "18-2402. DEFINITIONS. The following definitions are applicable to this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Appropriate.\" To \"appropriate\" property of another to oneself or a third person means:\n\n(a) To exercise control over it, or to aid a third person to exercise control over it, permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances as to acquire the major portion of its economic value or benefit; or\n\n(b) To dispose of the property for the benefit of oneself or a third person.\n\n(2) \"Deception\" means knowingly to:\n\n(a) Create or confirm another’s impression that is false and that the offender does not believe to be true; or\n\n(b) Fail to correct a false impression that the offender previously has created or confirmed; or\n\n(c) Prevent another from acquiring information pertinent to the disposition of the property involved; or\n\n(d) Sell or otherwise transfer or encumber property, failing to disclose a lien, adverse claim, or other legal impediment to the enjoyment of the property whether such impediment is or is not valid or is or is not a matter of official record; or\n\n(e) Promise performance that the offender does not intend to perform or knows will not be performed. Failure to perform, standing alone, is not evidence that the offender did not intend to perform.\n\n(3) \"Deprive.\" To \"deprive\" another of property means:\n\n(a) To withhold it or cause it to be withheld from him permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to him; or\n\n(b) To dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property.\n\n(4) \"Obtain\" means:\n\n(a) In relation to property, to bring about a transfer of interest or possession, whether to the offender or to another; and\n\n(b) In relation to labor or services, to secure the performance thereof.\n\n(5) \"Obtains or exerts control\" over property includes but is not limited to the taking, carrying away, or the sale, conveyance, or transfer of title to, or interest in, or possession of property.\n\n(6) \"Owner.\" When property is taken, obtained, or withheld by one (1) person from another person, an owner thereof means any person who has a right to possession thereof superior to that of the taker, obtainer, or withholder. \"Owner\" includes any person who physically delivers or transfers goods or property to a purchaser through an agreement or contract in which the purchaser has entered into fraudulently by having no intention to pay any amount for the goods or property. For the purposes of this chapter and regardless of any contrary provisions of chapter 2, title 28, Idaho Code, such owner retains a superior right to possession of such goods or property over the fraudulent purchaser.\n\n(7) \"Person\" means an individual, corporation, association, public or private corporation, city or other municipality, county, state agency, or the state of Idaho.\n\n(8) \"Property\" means anything of value. Property includes real estate, money, commercial instruments, admission or transportation tickets, written instruments representing or embodying rights concerning anything of value, labor or services, or otherwise of value to the owner; things growing on, affixed to, or found on land, or part of or affixed to any building; electricity, gas, steam, and water; birds, animals and fish, which ordinarily are kept in a state of confinement; food and drink; samples, cultures, microorganisms, specimens, records, recordings, documents, blueprints, drawings, maps, and whole or partial copies, descriptions, photographs, prototypes or models thereof; or any other articles, materials, devices, substances and whole or partial copies, descriptions, photographs, prototypes or models thereof which constitute, represent, evidence, reflect or record a secret scientific, technical, merchandising, production or management information, design, process, procedure, formula, invention, or improvement.\n\n(9) \"Service\" includes but is not limited to labor, professional service, transportation service, the supplying of hotel accommodations, restaurant services, entertainment, (a communication system) the supplying of equipment for use, and the supplying of commodities of a public utility nature such as gas, electricity, steam and water. A ticket or equivalent instrument that evidences a right to receive a service is not in itself service but constitutes property within the meaning of subsection (8) of this section.\n\n(10) \"Stolen property\" means property over which control has been obtained by theft.\n\n(11) \"Value.\" The value of property shall be ascertained as follows:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime, or if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.\n\n(b) Whether or not they have been issued or delivered, certain written instruments, not including those having a readily ascertainable market value such as some public and corporate bonds and securities, shall be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. The value of an instrument constituting an evidence of debt, such as a check, draft or promissory note, shall be deemed the amount due or collectible thereon or thereby, such figure ordinarily being the face amount of the indebtedness less any portion thereof which has been satisfied.\n\n2. The value of a ticket or equivalent instrument that evidences a right to receive a transportation, entertainment or other service shall be deemed the price stated thereon, if any; and if no price is stated thereon, the value shall be deemed the price of such ticket or equivalent instrument that the issuer charges the general public.\n\n3. The value of any other instrument that creates, releases, discharges or otherwise affects any valuable legal right, privilege or obligation shall be deemed the greatest amount of economic loss the owner of the instrument might reasonably suffer by virtue of the loss of the instrument.\n\n(c) When the value of property cannot be satisfactorily ascertained pursuant to the standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, its value shall be deemed to be one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less.\n\n(d) For the purpose of establishing value of any written instrument, the interest of any owner or owners entitled to part or all of the property represented by such instrument, by reason of such instrument, may be shown, even if another owner may be named in the complaint, information or indictment.\n\n[18-2402, added 1981, ch. 183, sec. 2, p. 320; am. 1994, ch. 132, sec. 1, p. 301; am. 1999, ch. 147, sec. 1, p. 417; am. 2022, ch. 212, sec. 1, p. 682.]",

      "text": "18-2403. THEFT. (1) A person steals property and commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof.\n\n(2) Theft includes a wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of another’s property, with the intent prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, committed in any of the following ways:\n\n(a) By deception obtains or exerts control over property of the owner;\n\n(b) By conduct heretofore defined or known as larceny; common law larceny by trick; embezzlement; extortion; obtaining property, money or labor under false pretenses; or receiving stolen goods;\n\n(c) By acquiring lost property. A person acquires lost property when he exercises control over property of another which he knows to have been lost or mislaid, or to have been delivered under a mistake as to the identity of the recipient or the nature or amount of the property, without taking reasonable measures to return such property to the owner; or a person commits theft of lost or mislaid property when he:\n\n1. Knows or learns the identity of the owner or knows, or is aware of, or learns of a reasonable method of identifying the owner; and\n\n2. Fails to take reasonable measures to restore the property to the owner; and\n\n3. Intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property.\n\n(d) By false promise:\n\n1. A person obtains property by false promise when pursuant to a scheme to defraud, he obtains property of another by means of a representation, express or implied, that he or a third person will in the future engage in particular conduct, and when he does not intend to engage in such conduct or, as the case may be, does not believe that the third person intends to engage in such conduct.\n\n2. In any prosecution for theft based upon a false promise, the defendant’s intention or belief that the promise would not be performed may not be established by or inferred from the fact alone that such promise was not performed. Such a finding may be based only upon evidence establishing that the facts and circumstances of the case are consistent with guilty intent or belief and inconsistent with innocent intent or belief, and excluding to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis except that of the defendant’s intention or belief that the promise would not be performed;\n\n(e) By extortion. A person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will:\n\n1. Cause physical injury to some person in the future; or\n\n2. Cause damage to property; or\n\n3. Engage in other conduct constituting a crime; or\n\n4. Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against him; or\n\n5. Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or\n\n6. Cause a strike, boycott or other collective labor group action injurious to some person’s business; except that such a threat shall not be deemed extortion when the property is demanded or received for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor purports to act; or\n\n7. Testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another’s legal claim or defense; or\n\n8. Use or abuse his position as a public servant by performing some act within or related to his official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty, in such manner as to affect some person adversely; or\n\n9. Perform any other act which would not in itself materially benefit the actor but which is calculated to harm another person materially with respect to his health, safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation or personal relationships.\n\n(3) A person commits theft when he knowingly takes or exercises unauthorized control over, or makes an unauthorized transfer of an interest in, the property of another person, with the intent of depriving the owner thereof.\n\n(4) A person commits theft when he knowingly receives, retains, conceals, obtains control over, possesses, or disposes of stolen property, knowing the property to have been stolen or under such circumstances as would reasonably induce him to believe that the property was stolen, and\n\n(a) Intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property; or\n\n(b) Knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property in such manner as to deprive the owner permanently of such use or benefit; or\n\n(c) Uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing such use, concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner permanently of such use or benefit.\n\n(5) Theft of labor or services or use of property.\n\n(a) A person commits theft when he obtains the temporary use of property, labor or services of another which are available only for hire, by means of threat or deception or knowing that such use is without the consent of the person providing the property, labor or services.\n\n(b) A person commits theft when after renting or leasing a motor vehicle or other equipment under an agreement in writing which provides for the return of the vehicle or other equipment to a particular place at a particular time, he willfully or intentionally fails to return the vehicle or other equipment to that place within forty-eight (48) hours after the time specified.\n\n(c) A person commits theft if, having control over the disposition of services of others, to which he is not entitled, he knowingly diverts such services to his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto.\n\n[18-2403, added 1981, ch. 183, sec. 2, p. 322; am. 1985, ch. 216, sec. 1, p. 525; am. 2001, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 401; am. 2017, ch. 215, sec. 1, p. 520.]",

(1) It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the offender is not entitled.\n\n(2) Where the property involved is that of the offender’s spouse, no prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.\n\n(3) In any prosecution for theft committed by trespassory taking or the offense previously known as embezzlement, it is an affirmative defense that the property was appropriated openly and avowedly, and under a claim of right made in good faith. It is not a defense to a theft committed by such conduct that the accused intended to restore the property taken, but may be considered by the court to mitigate punishment if the property is voluntarily and actually restored (or tendered) prior to the filing of any complaint or indictment relating thereto, and this provision does not excuse the unlawful retention of the property of another to offset or pay demands held against such other person.\n\n(4) In any prosecution for theft by extortion committed by instilling in the victim a fear that he or another person would be charged with a crime, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant reasonably believed the threatened charge to be true and that his sole purpose was to compel or induce the victim to take reasonable action to make good the wrong which was the subject of such threatened charge.\n\n(5) It is no defense to a prosecution for theft under a provision of this chapter that the defendant, by reason of the same conduct, also committed an act specified as a crime in another chapter of title 18, or another title of the Idaho Code.\n\n[18-2406, added 1981, ch. 183, sec. 2, p. 324; am. 2008, ch. 23, sec. 1, p. 36.]",

Cause physical injury to some person in the future; or\n\n2. Cause damage to property; or\n\n3. Use or abuse his position as a public servant by engaging in conduct within or related to his official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty, in such manner as to affect some person adversely.\n\n(b) A person is guilty of grand theft when he commits a theft as defined in this chapter and when:\n\n1. The value of the property taken exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000); or\n\n2. The property consists of a public record, writing or instrument kept, filed or deposited according to law with or in the keeping of any public office or public servant; or\n\n3. The property consists of a check, draft or order for the payment of money upon any bank, or a check, draft or order account number, or a financial transaction card or financial transaction card account number as those terms are defined in section 18-3122, Idaho Code; or\n\n4. The property, regardless of its nature or value, is taken from the person of another; or\n\n5. The property, regardless of its nature and value, is obtained by extortion; or\n\n6. The property consists of one (1) or more firearms, rifles or shotguns; or\n\n7. The property taken or deliberately killed is livestock or any other animal exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150) in value.\n\n8. When any series of thefts, comprised of individual thefts having a value of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less, are part of a common scheme or plan, the thefts may be aggregated in one (1) count and the sum of the value of all of the thefts shall be the value considered in determining whether the value exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000); or\n\n9. The property has an aggregate value over fifty dollars ($50.00) and is stolen during three (3) or more incidents of theft during a criminal episode. For purposes of this subparagraph a \"criminal episode\" shall mean a series of unlawful acts committed over a period of up to three (3) days; or\n\n10.
