The court may authorize the taking of depositions to inquire further into the substance of such reports or synopses.\n\n(c) Raising an issue of mental condition in a criminal proceeding shall constitute a waiver of any privilege that might otherwise be interposed to bar the production of evidence on the subject and, upon request, the court shall order that the state’s experts shall have access to the defendant in such cases for the purpose of having its own experts conduct an examination in preparation for any legal proceeding at which the defendant’s mental condition may be in issue.\n\n(d) The court is authorized to appoint at least one (1) expert at public expense upon a showing by an indigent defendant that there is a need to inquire into questions of the defendant’s mental condition.

(1) Whenever there is reason to doubt the defendant’s fitness to proceed as set forth in section 18-210, Idaho Code, the court shall appoint at least one (1) qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist or shall request the director of the department of health and welfare to designate at least one (1) qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant to assist counsel with defense or understand the proceedings. The appointed examiner shall also evaluate whether the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment. The costs of examination shall be paid by the defendant if he is financially able. The determination of ability to pay shall be made in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Within three (3) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, of the appointment or designation, the examiner shall determine the best location for the examination. If practical, the examination shall be conducted locally on an outpatient basis.\n\n(3) If the examiner determines that confinement is necessary for purposes of the examination, the court may order the defendant to be confined to a jail, a hospital, or other suitable facility for that purpose for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days. The order of confinement shall require the county sheriff to transport the defendant to and from the facility and shall notify the facility of any known medical, behavioral, or security requirements of the defendant. The court, upon request, may make available to the examiner any court records relating to the defendant.\n\n(4) In such examination, any method may be employed that is accepted by the examiner’s profession for the examination of those alleged not to be competent to assist counsel in their defense.\n\n(5) Upon completion of the examination, a report shall be submitted to the court and shall include the following:\n\n(a) A description of the nature of the examination;\n\n(b) A diagnosis or evaluation of the mental condition of the defendant;\n\n(c) An opinion as to the defendant’s capacity to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense;\n\n(d) An opinion whether the defendant lacks the capacity to make informed decisions about treatment. \"Lack of capacity to make informed decisions about treatment\" means the defendant’s inability, by reason of his mental condition, to achieve a rudimentary understanding of the purpose, nature, and possible significant risks and benefits of treatment, after conscientious efforts at explanation.\n\n(6) If the examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the defendant to participate therein, the report shall so state and shall include, if possible, an opinion as to whether such unwillingness of the defendant was the result of mental disease or defect.\n\n(7) The report of the examination shall be filed with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n\n(8) When the defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of his own choice, such examiner shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the defendant for the purpose of examination.\n\n(9) In the event a defendant is suspected of being developmentally disabled, the examination shall proceed with those experts set out in subsection (7) of section 66-402, Idaho Code.\n\n(10) In addition to the psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or evaluation committee, the court may appoint additional experts to examine the defendant.\n\n(11) If, at any time during the examination process, the examiner has reason to believe that the defendant’s alleged incompetency may be the result of a developmental disability and the matter has not already been referred to an evaluation committee for review, the examiner shall immediately notify the court. The court shall then appoint an evaluation committee or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within two (2) business days, an evaluation committee consistent with section 66-402(7), Idaho Code.\n\n(12) If the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, as defined in section 66-317, Idaho Code, the court may authorize consent to be given pursuant to section 66-322, Idaho Code. If the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions as defined in subsection (9) of section 66-402, Idaho Code, the court may authorize consent to be given pursuant to sections 66-404 and 66-405, Idaho Code.\n\n(13) If the defendant was confined solely for the purpose of examination, he shall be released from the facility within three (3) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, following notification of completion of the examination.\n\n[18-211, added 1972, ch. 336, sec. 1, p. 851; am. 1974, ch. 165, sec. 1, p. 1405; am. 1980, ch. 312, sec. 1, p. 797; am. 1982, ch. 368, sec. 3, p. 920; am. 1987, ch. 40, sec. 1, p. 67; am. 1996, ch. 225, sec. 2, p. 738; am. 1998, ch. 90, sec. 7, p. 323; am. 1999, ch. 293, sec. 4, p. 737; am. 2000, ch. 234, sec. 1, p. 656; am. 2019, ch. 299, sec. 1, p. 888; am. 2022, ch. 26, sec. 1, p. 72.]",

(1) When the defendant’s fitness to proceed is drawn in question, the issue shall be determined by the court. The court shall also determine, based on the examiner’s findings, whether the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment. If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the defendant contests the finding of the report filed pursuant to section 18-211, Idaho Code, the court may make the determination on the basis of such report. If the finding is contested, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence upon such hearing, the party who contests the finding thereof shall have the right to summon and to cross-examine the psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who submitted the report and to offer evidence upon the issue.\n\n(2) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed, the proceeding against him shall be suspended, except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, and the court shall commit him to the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days, for care and treatment at an appropriate facility of the department of health and welfare or, if the defendant is found to be dangerously mentally ill as defined in section 66-1305, Idaho Code, to the department of correction for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days. The order of commitment shall include the finding by the court whether the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment. For purposes of this section, \"facility\" shall mean a state hospital, institution, mental health center, or those facilities enumerated in subsection (8) of section 66-402, Idaho Code, equipped to evaluate or rehabilitate such defendants. The order of commitment shall require the county sheriff to transport the defendant to and from the facility and require an evaluation of the defendant’s mental condition at the time of admission to the facility and a progress report on the defendant’s mental condition. The progress report shall include an opinion whether the defendant is fit to proceed, or if not, whether there is a substantial probability the defendant will be fit to proceed within the foreseeable future. If the report concludes that there is a substantial probability that the defendant will be fit to proceed in the foreseeable future, the court may order the continued commitment of the defendant for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days. If at any time the director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines that the defendant is fit to proceed, such determination shall be reported to the court.\n\n(3) If during a commitment under this section a defendant who has the capacity to make informed decisions about treatment refuses any and all treatment, or the only treatment available to restore competency for trial, the court shall, within seven (7) days, excluding weekends and holidays, of receiving notice of the defendant’s refusal from the facility, conduct a hearing on whether to order involuntary treatment or order such other terms and conditions as may be determined appropriate. The burden shall be on the state to demonstrate grounds for involuntary treatment including, but not limited to: the prescribed treatment is essential to restore the defendant’s competency, the medical necessity and appropriateness of the prescribed treatment, no less intrusive treatment alternative exists to render the defendant competent for trial, and other relevant information. If each of these findings is made by the court, treatment shall be ordered consistent with the findings.\n\n(4) Each report shall be filed with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant. Upon receipt of a report, the court shall determine, after a hearing if a hearing is requested, the disposition of the defendant and the proceedings against him. If the court determines that the defendant is fit to proceed, the proceeding shall be resumed. If at the end of the initial ninety (90) days the court determines that the defendant is unfit and there is not a substantial probability the defendant will be fit to proceed within the foreseeable future or if the defendant is not fit to proceed after the expiration of the additional one hundred eighty (180) days, involuntary commitment proceedings shall be instituted pursuant to either section 66-329 or 66-406, Idaho Code, in the court in which the criminal charge is pending.\n\n(5) In its review of commitments pursuant to section 66-337, Idaho Code, the department of health and welfare shall determine whether the defendant is fit to proceed with trial. The department of health and welfare shall review its commitments pursuant to chapter 4, title 66, Idaho Code, and may recommend that the defendant is fit to proceed with trial. If the district court which committed the defendant pursuant to section 66-406, Idaho Code, agrees with the department’s recommendation and finds the conditions which justified the order pursuant to section 66-406, Idaho Code, do not continue to exist, criminal proceedings may resume. If the defendant is fit to proceed, the court in which the criminal charge is pending shall be notified and the criminal proceedings may resume. If, however, the court is of the view that so much time has elapsed, excluding any time spent free from custody by reason of the escape of the defendant, since the commitment of the defendant that it would be unjust to resume the criminal proceeding, the court may dismiss the charge.\n\n(6) If a defendant escapes from custody during his confinement, the director shall immediately notify the court from which committed, the prosecuting attorney and the sheriff of the county from which committed. The court shall forthwith issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or the director of the institution from which the defendant escaped to take the defendant into custody and immediately return him to his place of confinement.\n\n[18-212, added 1972, ch. 336, sec. 1, p. 852; am. 1974, ch. 165, sec. 2, p. 1405; am. 1977, ch. 13, sec. 1, p. 25; am. 1980, ch. 312, sec. 2, p. 798; am. 1982, ch. 368, sec. 4, p. 921; am. 1987, ch. 40, sec. 2, p. 69; am. 1999, ch. 293, sec. 5, p. 739; am. 2000, ch. 234, sec. 2, p. 657; am. 2022, ch. 26, sec. 2, p. 73.]",
