The license application shall be in a form to be prescribed by the director of the Idaho state police and must meet the following requirements:\n\n(a) The license application shall require the applicant’s name, address, description, signature, date of birth, place of birth, military status, citizenship and the driver’s license number or state identification card number if used for identification in applying for the license.

Within five (5) days after the filing of an application, the sheriff must forward the applicant’s completed license application and fingerprints to the Idaho state police. The Idaho state police must conduct a national fingerprint-based records check, an inquiry through the national instant criminal background check system and a check of any applicable state database, including a check for any mental health records for conditions or commitments that would disqualify a person from possessing a firearm under state or federal law, and return the results to the sheriff within sixty (60) days. If the applicant is not a United States citizen, an immigration alien query must also be conducted through United States immigration and customs enforcement or any successor agency. The sheriff shall not issue a license before receiving the results of the records check and must deny a license if the applicant is disqualified under any of the criteria listed in subsection (11) of this section. The sheriff may deny a license to carry concealed weapons to an alien if background information is not attainable or verifiable.\n\n(11) A license to carry concealed weapons shall not be issued to any person who:\n\n(a) Is under twenty-one (21) years of age, except as otherwise provided in this section;\n\n(b) Is formally charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one (1) year;\n\n(c) Has been adjudicated guilty in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one (1) year;\n\n(d) Is a fugitive from justice;\n\n(e) Is an unlawful user of marijuana or any depressant, stimulant or narcotic drug, or any controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802;\n\n(f) Is currently suffering from or has been adjudicated as having suffered from any of the following conditions, based on substantial evidence:\n\n(i) Lacking mental capacity as defined in section 18-210, Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) Mentally ill as defined in section 66-317, Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) Gravely disabled as defined in section 66-317, Idaho Code; or\n\n(iv) An incapacitated person as defined in section 15-5-101, Idaho Code;\n\n(g) Has been discharged from the armed forces under dishonorable conditions;\n\n(h) Has received a withheld judgment or suspended sentence for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one (1) year, unless the person has successfully completed probation;\n\n(i) Has received a period of probation after having been adjudicated guilty of, or received a withheld judgment for, a misdemeanor offense that has as an element the intentional use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, unless the person has successfully completed probation;\n\n(j) Is an alien illegally in the United States;\n\n(k) Is a person who having been a citizen of the United States has renounced his or her citizenship;\n\n(l) Is free on bond or personal recognizance pending trial, appeal or sentencing for a crime that would disqualify him from obtaining a concealed weapons license;\n\n(m) Is subject to a protection order issued under chapter 63, title 39, Idaho Code, that restrains the person from harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner of the person, or child of the intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child; or\n\n(n) Is for any other reason ineligible to own, possess or receive a firearm under the provisions of Idaho or federal law.\n\n(12) In making a determination in relation to an applicant’s eligibility under subsection (11) of this section, the sheriff shall not consider:\n\n(a) A conviction, guilty plea or adjudication that has been nullified by expungement, pardon, setting aside or other comparable procedure by the jurisdiction where the conviction, guilty plea or adjudication occurred or in respect of which conviction, guilty plea or adjudication the applicant’s civil right to bear arms either specifically or in combination with other civil rights has been restored under operation of law or legal process; or\n\n(b) Except as provided for in subsection (11)(f) of this section, an adjudication of mental defect, incapacity or illness or an involuntary commitment to a mental institution if the applicant’s civil right to bear arms has been restored under operation of law or legal process.\n\n(13) A license to carry concealed weapons must be in a form substantially similar to that of the Idaho driver’s license and must meet the following specifications:\n\n(a) The license must provide the licensee’s name, address, date of birth and the driver’s license number or state identification card number if used for identification in applying for the license;\n\n(b) The license must bear the licensee’s signature and picture; and\n\n(c) The license must provide the date of issuance and the date on which the license expires.\n\n(14) Upon issuing a license under the provisions of this section, the sheriff must notify the Idaho state police within three (3) business days on a form or in a manner prescribed by the Idaho state police. Information relating to an applicant or licensee received or maintained pursuant to this section by the sheriff or Idaho state police is confidential and exempt from disclosure under section 74-105, Idaho Code.\n\n(15) The fee for original issuance of a license shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which the sheriff must retain for the purpose of performing the duties required in this section. The sheriff may collect the actual cost of any additional fees necessary to cover the cost of processing fingerprints lawfully required by any state or federal agency or department, and the actual cost of materials for the license lawfully required by any state agency or department, which costs must be paid to the state. The sheriff must provide the applicant with a copy of the results of the fingerprint-based records check upon request of the applicant.\n\n(16) The fee for renewal of the license shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00), which the sheriff must retain for the purpose of performing the duties required in this section. The sheriff may collect the actual cost of any additional fees necessary to cover the processing costs lawfully required by any state or federal agency or department, and the actual cost of materials for the license lawfully required by any state agency or department, which costs must be paid to the state.\n\n(17) Every license that is not, as provided by law, suspended, revoked or disqualified in this state shall be renewable at any time during the ninety (90) day period before its expiration or within ninety (90) days after the expiration date. The sheriff must mail renewal notices ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the license. The sheriff shall require the licensee applying for renewal to complete an application. The sheriff must submit the application to the Idaho state police for a records check of state and national databases. The Idaho state police must conduct the records check and return the results to the sheriff within thirty (30) days.

A renewal license shall be valid for a period of five (5) years. A license so renewed shall take effect on the expiration date of the prior license. A licensee renewing ninety-one (91) days to one hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration date of the license must pay a late renewal penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) in addition to the renewal fee unless waived by the sheriff, except that any licensee serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States during the renewal period shall not be required to pay a late renewal penalty upon renewing ninety-one (91) days to one hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration date of the license. After one hundred eighty-one (181) days, the licensee must submit an initial application for a license and pay the fees prescribed in subsection (15) of this section. The renewal fee and any penalty shall be paid to the sheriff for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

A civil action may be brought to enjoin a wrongful refusal to issue a license or a wrongful modification of the requirements of this section. The civil action may be brought in the county in which the application was made or in Ada county at the discretion of the petitioner. Any person who prevails against a public agency in any action in the courts for a violation of this section must be awarded costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the legal action.\n\n(19) A county sheriff, deputy sheriff or county employee who issues a license to carry a concealed weapon under this section shall not incur any civil or criminal liability as the result of the performance of his duties in compliance with this section.\n\n(20) The sheriff of a county shall issue a license to carry a concealed weapon to those individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-one (21) years who, except for the age requirement contained in section 18-3302K(4), Idaho Code, would otherwise meet the requirements for issuance of a license under section 18-3302K, Idaho Code. Licenses issued to individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-one (21) years under this subsection shall be easily distinguishable from licenses issued pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. A license issued pursuant to this subsection after July 1, 2016, shall expire on the twenty-first birthday of the licensee. A licensee, upon attaining the age of twenty-one (21) years, shall be allowed to renew the license under the procedure contained in section 18-3302K(9), Idaho Code. Such renewal license shall be issued as an enhanced license pursuant to the provisions of section 18-3302K, Idaho Code.\n\n(21) A person carrying a concealed weapon in violation of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(22) The sheriff of the county where the license was issued or the sheriff of the county where the person resides shall have the power to revoke a license subsequent to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, for any of the following reasons:\n\n(a) Fraud or intentional misrepresentation in the obtaining of a license;\n\n(b) Misuse of a license, including lending or giving a license to another person, duplicating a license or using a license with the intent to unlawfully cause harm to a person or property;\n\n(c) The doing of an act or existence of a condition that would have been grounds for the denial of the license by the sheriff;\n\n(d) The violation of any of the terms of this section; or\n\n(e) The applicant is adjudicated guilty of or receives a withheld judgment for a crime that would have disqualified him from initially receiving a license.\n\n(23) A person twenty-one (21) years of age or older who presents a valid license to carry concealed weapons is exempt from any requirement to undergo a records check at the time of purchase or transfer of a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Provided however, a temporary emergency license issued pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall not exempt the holder of the license from any records check requirement.\n\n(24) The attorney general must contact the appropriate officials in other states for the purpose of establishing, to the extent possible, recognition and reciprocity of the license to carry concealed weapons by other states, whether by formal agreement or otherwise. The Idaho state police must keep a copy and maintain a record of all such agreements and reciprocity recognitions, which must be made available to the public.\n\n(25) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be construed to limit the existing rights of a private property owner, private tenant, private employer, or private business entity. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any property owned by the state of Idaho or its political subdivisions that is normally and habitually open to the public. Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall supersede Herndon v. City of Sandpoint, 531 P.3d 1125 (Idaho 2023).\n\n(a) Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall apply whether such property is leased, rented, licensed, loaned, permitted, or occupied, whether for consideration or not.\n\n(b) Any restriction on the carrying of concealed weapons pursuant to this subsection may only be invoked for public property owned by the state or its political subdivisions when the use of such property is for a private event by invitation only, for a commercial event that charges admission, or for any other event with restricted access whether admission is charged or not. For any such private event, commercial event, or other event, it must appear to a reasonable person that the general public does not have unrestricted access to the designated public property, or any subset of such property, that is normally and habitually open to the public.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subsection relieves any political subdivision of the state of Idaho of its duties to convey or manage public property in accordance with Idaho law.\n\n(d) Nothing in this subsection alters or amends the provisions of section 18-3302C or 18-3309, Idaho Code.\n\n(26) The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of this section or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of remaining portions of this section.\n\n[18-3302, added 2015, ch. 303, sec. 2, p. 1188; am. 2016, ch. 208, sec. 1, p. 585; am. 2017, ch. 231, sec. 1, p. 558; am. 2019, ch. 272, sec. 1, p. 791; am. 2019, ch. 273, sec. 1, p. 798; am. 2020, ch. 82, sec. 9, p. 179; am. 2020, ch. 315, sec. 1, p. 893; am. 2024, ch. 206, sec. 1, p. 732.]",

A licensee renewing ninety-one (91) days to one hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration date of the license must pay a late renewal penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) in addition to the renewal fee, except that any licensee serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States during the renewal period shall not be required to pay a late renewal penalty upon renewing ninety-one (91) days to one hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration date of the license.

(1) The legislature finds that:\n\n(a) The second amendment to the United States constitution guarantees the people the right to keep and bear arms;\n\n(b) Section 11, article I of the constitution of the state of Idaho provides that the \"people have the right to keep and bear arms, which right shall not be abridged;… No law shall impose licensure, registration or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition\";\n\n(c) In September 2022, the world’s three (3) largest payment card networks publicly announced they would assign a unique merchant category code to firearm retailers accepting payment cards for purchases, after twenty-eight (28) members of congress sent a public letter to networks, pressuring them to adopt the new code;\n\n(d) In the letter to payment card networks, federal lawmakers stated that the new merchant category code for firearms retailers would be \"the first step towards facilitating the collection of valuable financial data that could help law enforcement in countering the financing of terrorism efforts,\" expressing a clear government expectation that networks will utilize the new merchant category code to conduct mass surveillance of constitutionally protected firearms and ammunition purchases in cooperation with law enforcement;\n\n(e) The new merchant category code will allow payment card networks, acquirers, and other entities involved in payment card processing to identify and separately track lawful payment card purchases at firearms retailers in Idaho, paving the way for both unprecedented surveillance of second amendment activity and unprecedented information sharing between payment networks and the government; and\n\n(f) This potential for cooperative surveillance and tracking of lawful firearm and ammunition purchases will have a significant chilling effect on citizens wishing to exercise their federal and state constitutional rights to keep and bear arms in Idaho.\n\n(2) Based on the findings described in subsection (1) of this section, it is the intent of the legislature to prohibit the misuse of payment card processing systems to surveil, report, or otherwise discourage constitutionally protected firearm, firearm accessories or components, and ammunition purchases and sales within Idaho’s jurisdiction.\n\n(3) This section and section 18-3326A, Idaho Code, shall be construed as generally applicable consumer financial protection law and shall not prevent or significantly interfere with the duly authorized powers of any bank or directly or indirectly discriminate against any bank based on its charter or structure. This section and section 18-3326A, Idaho Code, shall not apply to any financial institution as defined in section 18-3326A, Idaho Code, or any person, company, entity, or organization regulated by the Idaho department of finance or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction, rules, or regulations of the federal deposit insurance corporation.\n\n[18-3326, added 2023, ch. 303, sec. 1, p. 913.]",
