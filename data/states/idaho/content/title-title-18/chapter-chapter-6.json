(1) The legislature finds:\n\n(a) That children have a special place in society that the law should reflect;\n\n(b) That minors too often lack maturity and make choices that do not include consideration of both immediate and long-term consequences;\n\n(c) That the medical, emotional and psychological consequences of abortion and childbirth are serious and can be lasting, particularly when the patient is immature;\n\n(d) That the capacity to become pregnant and the capacity for mature judgment concerning the wisdom of bearing a child or of having an abortion are not necessarily related;\n\n(e) That parents, when aware that their daughter is pregnant or has had an abortion are in the best position to ensure that she receives adequate medical attention during her pregnancy or after her abortion;\n\n(f) That except in rare cases, parents possess knowledge regarding their child which is essential for a physician to exercise the best medical judgment for that child;\n\n(g) That when a minor is faced with the difficulties of an unplanned pregnancy, the best interests of the minor are always served when there is careful consideration of the rights of parents in rearing their child and the unique counsel and nurturing environment that parents can provide;\n\n(h) That informed consent is always necessary for making mature health care decisions.\n\n(2) It is the intent of the legislature in enacting section 18-609A, Idaho Code, to further the following important and compelling state interests recognized by the United States supreme court in:\n\n(a) Protecting minors against their own immaturity;\n\n(b) Preserving the integrity of the family unit;\n\n(c) Defending the authority of parents to direct the rearing of children who are members of their household;\n\n(d) Providing a pregnant minor with the advice and support of a parent during a decisional period;\n\n(e) Providing for proper medical treatment and aftercare when the life or physical health of the pregnant minor is at serious risk in the rare instance of a sudden and unexpected medical emergency.\n\n[(18-602) 18-601, added 2000, ch. 7, sec. 1, p. 11; am. and redesig. 2001, ch. 273, sec. 2, p. 997; am. 2005, ch. 393, sec. 1, p. 1319 (2007, ch. 193, sec. 1, repealed 2005, ch. 393)]",

If the materials are not available from the director of the department of health and welfare, no certification shall be required. The attending physician, or the attending physician’s agent, shall provide any other information required under this act.\n\n(5) Except in the case of medical emergency, no abortion shall be performed unless, prior to an initial consultation or any testing, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman is informed by telephone or in person, by the physician who is to perform the abortion or by an agent of the physician, that ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitoring are available to the woman enabling the pregnant woman to view her unborn child or observe the heartbeat of the unborn child. The physician or agent of the physician shall inform the pregnant woman that the website and printed materials described in subsection (2)(d), (e) and (f) of this section contain telephone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses of facilities that offer such services at no cost.

No fee for an abortion shall be collected prior to providing the information required in this subsection.\n\n(6) All physicians or their agents who use ultrasound equipment in the performance of an abortion shall inform the patient that she has the right to view the ultrasound image of her unborn child before an abortion is performed. If the patient requests to view the ultrasound image, she shall be allowed to view it before an abortion is performed. The physician or agent shall also offer to provide the patient with a physical picture of the ultrasound image of her unborn child prior to the performance of the abortion, and shall provide it if requested by the patient. In addition to providing the material, the attending physician may provide the pregnant patient with such other information which in the attending physician’s judgment is relevant to the pregnant patient’s decision as to whether to have the abortion or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n(7) Within thirty (30) days after performing any abortion without certification and delivery of the materials, the attending physician, or the attending physician’s agent, shall cause to be delivered to the director of the department of health and welfare, a report signed by the attending physician, preserving the patient’s anonymity, denoting the medical emergency that excused compliance with the duty to deliver the materials. The director of the department of health and welfare shall compile the information annually and report to the public the total number of abortions performed in the state where delivery of the materials was excused; provided that any information so reported shall not identify any physician or patient in any manner which would reveal their identities.\n\n(8) If section 18-608(3), Idaho Code, applies to the abortion to be performed and the pregnant patient is an adult and for any reason unable to give a valid consent thereto, the requirement for that pregnant patient’s consent shall be met as required by law for other medical or surgical procedures and shall be determined in consideration of the desires, interests and welfare of the pregnant patient.\n\n(9) The knowing failure of the attending physician to perform any one (1) or more of the acts required under subsection (7) of this section or section 39-261, Idaho Code, is grounds for discipline pursuant to section 54-1814(6), Idaho Code, and shall subject the physician to assessment of a civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100) for each month or portion thereof that each such failure continues, payable to the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare, but such failure shall not constitute a criminal act.\n\n[18-609, added 1973, ch. 197, sec. 8, p. 442; am. 1982, ch. 242, sec. 1, p. 628; am. 1983, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 403; am. 2000, ch. 7, sec. 4, p. 13; am. 2006, ch. 438, sec. 3, p. 1324; am. 2007, ch. 224, sec. 1, p. 676; am. 2008, ch. 348, sec. 1, p. 958; am. 2016, ch. 283, sec. 1, p. 782; am. 2018, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 315; am. 2021, ch. 258, sec. 3, p. 794.]",

Provided however, that a civil action by the father is barred if the pregnancy resulted from the father’s criminal conduct or if the father consented to the abortion. Further, a civil action by the maternal grandparents is barred if the pregnancy is the result of a maternal grandparent’s criminal conduct or if a maternal grandparent consented to the abortion.\n\n(b) As used in this section, \"appropriate relief\" shall include:\n\n(i) Money damages for all mental and physical injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the abortion performed in violation of this section;\n\n(ii) Money damages equal to three (3) times the cost of performing the abortion procedure.\n\n(4) (a) Hearing.

The professional license of any health care professional who performs or attempts to perform an abortion or who assists in performing or attempting to perform an abortion in violation of this subsection shall be suspended by the appropriate licensing board for a minimum of six (6) months upon a first offense and shall be permanently revoked upon a subsequent offense.\n\n(2) The following shall not be considered criminal abortions for purposes of subsection (1) of this section:\n\n(a) The abortion was performed or attempted by a physician as defined in this chapter and:\n\n(i) The physician determined, in his good faith medical judgment and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman. No abortion shall be deemed necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman because the physician believes that the woman may or will take action to harm herself; and\n\n(ii) The physician performed or attempted to perform the abortion in the manner that, in his good faith medical judgment and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, provided the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless, in his good faith medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in that manner would have posed a greater risk of the death of the pregnant woman. No such greater risk shall be deemed to exist because the physician believes that the woman may or will take action to harm herself; or\n\n(b) The abortion was performed or attempted by a physician as defined in this chapter during the first trimester of pregnancy and:\n\n(i) If the woman is not a minor or subject to a guardianship, then, prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman has reported to a law enforcement agency that she is the victim of an act of rape or incest and provided a copy of such report to the physician who is to perform the abortion. The copy of the report shall remain a confidential part of the woman’s medical record subject to applicable privacy laws; or\n\n(ii) If the woman is a minor or subject to a guardianship, then, prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman or her parent or guardian has reported to a law enforcement agency or child protective services that she is the victim of an act of rape or incest and a copy of such report has been provided to the physician who is to perform the abortion. The copy of the report shall remain a confidential part of the woman’s medical record subject to applicable privacy laws.\n\n(3) If a report concerning an act of rape or incest is made to a law enforcement agency or child protective services pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section, then the person who made the report shall, upon request, be entitled to receive a copy of such report within seventy-two (72) hours of the report being made, provided that the report may be redacted as necessary to avoid interference with an investigation.\n\n(4) Medical treatment provided to a pregnant woman by a health care professional as defined in this chapter that results in the accidental death of, or unintentional injury to, the unborn child shall not be a violation of this section.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subject a pregnant woman on whom any abortion is performed or attempted to any criminal conviction and penalty.\n\n[18-622, added 2020, ch. 284, sec. 1, p. 827, effective August 25, 2022; am. 2023, ch. 298, sec. 2, p. 907.]",
