(1) When the employment of a health care provider has been terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, for adulteration or misappropriation of controlled substances, as defined in chapter 27, title 37, Idaho Code, the employer shall, within thirty (30) days of the termination, furnish written notice of the termination, described herein as \"notice of termination,\" to the health care provider’s professional licensing board of the state of Idaho, which shall include a description of the controlled substance adulteration or misappropriation involved in the termination. An employer who in good faith provides such information shall not be held civilly liable for the disclosure or the consequences of providing the information. There is a rebuttable presumption that an employer is acting in good faith when the employer provides such information. The presumption of good faith is overcome only upon showing by clear and convincing evidence that the employer disclosed the information with actual malice or with deliberate intent to mislead. For the purposes of this section, \"actual malice\" means knowledge that the information was false or given with reckless disregard of whether the information was false. For the purposes of this section, the term \"health care provider\" means any person licensed by a professional licensing board of the state of Idaho whose license permits the health care provider to dispense or administer controlled substances. For the purposes of this section, \"employer\" means a person or entity licensed under chapter 18, title 54, Idaho Code, or chapter 13, title 39, Idaho Code, who employs a health care provider or providers.\n\n(2) A professional licensing board that receives a notice of termination from an employer pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall maintain the notice of termination for the health care provider. The notice of termination shall be subject to disclosure in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(3) Any prospective employer of a health care provider shall, before hiring such health care provider, request in writing that the health care provider’s professional licensing board furnish the prospective employer any notice of termination maintained by the board with respect to the health care provider. The prospective employer shall maintain the confidentiality of such information and shall not disclose it to any other person or entity without the prior written approval of the health care provider or as required by law, court order or the rules of civil procedure. The professional licensing board shall require, as a condition of furnishing the notice of termination, that the prospective employer file a written request for the health care provider’s notice of termination, stating under oath that the request for the notice of termination is made for a bona fide hiring purpose, that the request is made pursuant to the provisions of this section, and that the prospective employer will not disclose the information to any other person or entity without the prior written approval of the health care provider or as required by law, court order or rules of civil procedure. In the event that the prospective employer discloses the information in the notice of termination to any other person or entity in violation of the provisions of this section, and unless the disclosure is required by law, court order or the rules of civil procedure, the health care provider may pursue a civil cause of action against the prospective employer for a breach of the health care provider’s right of privacy. Upon receipt of a request made in accordance with this section for a health care provider’s notice of termination, the professional licensing board shall furnish the notice of termination to the prospective employer. The professional licensing board shall not be held liable for the correctness or completeness of the information contained in the notice of termination and shall include a disclaimer statement on all released information, attesting that the information has not been verified by the professional licensing board. An employer who obtains a notice of termination from the appropriate professional licensing board as provided in this section shall not be held civilly liable for hiring or contracting with a health care provider who the employer in good faith believes has been rehabilitated from drug abuse, absent the employer’s gross negligence or reckless conduct.\n\n(4) Notices of termination submitted hereunder shall be maintained and available to employers as set forth above for fifteen (15) years from the date of receipt by the professional licensing board.\n\n[37-117A, added 2004, ch. 333, sec. 1, p. 993.]",

(a) Whenever a duly authorized agent of the director finds or has probable cause to believe, that any food, drug, device, or cosmetic is adulterated, or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, within the meaning of this act, he shall affix to such article a tag or other appropriate marking, giving notice that such article is, or is suspected of being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or disposal is given by such agent or the court. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or dispose of such detained or embargoed article by sale or otherwise without such permission.\n\n(b) When an article detained or embargoed under subsection (a) of this section has been found by such agent to be adulterated, or misbranded, he shall petition the probate court or district court in the county in whose jurisdiction the article is detained or embargoed for a libel for condemnation of such article. When such agent has found that an article so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, he shall remove the tag or other marking.\n\n(c) If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article is adulterated or misbranded, such article shall, after entry of the decree be destroyed at the expense of the claimant thereof, under the supervision of such agent, and all court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be taxed against the claimant of such article or his agent; provided, that when the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the article, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond, conditioned that such article shall be so labeled or processed, has been executed, may by order direct that such article be delivered to the claimant thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of an agent of the director. The expense of such supervision shall be paid by the claimant. Such bond shall be returned to the claimant of the article on representation to the court by the director that the article is no longer in violation of this act, and that the expenses of such supervision have been paid.\n\n(d) Whenever the director or any of its authorized agents shall find in any room, building, vehicle of transportation or other structure, any meat, sea food, poultry, vegetable, fruit or other perishable articles which are unsound, or contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the same being hereby declared to be a nuisance, the director or its authorized agent, shall forthwith condemn or destroy the same, or in any other manner render the same unsaleable as human food.\n\n(e) Whenever the director or its duly authorized agent shall find, or have probable cause to believe, that any food, drug, device or cosmetic is offered or exposed for sale, or held in possession with intent to distribute or sell, or is intended for distribution or sale in violation of any provision of this act, whether it is in the custody of a common carrier or any other person, the director may affix to such article a tag or other appropriate marking, giving notice that such article is, or is suspected of being, in violation of this act, and has been embargoed. Within seven (7) days after an embargo has been placed upon any article, the embargo shall be removed by the director or a summary proceeding for the confiscation of the article shall be instituted by the director. No person shall remove or dispose of such embargoed article by sale or otherwise without the permission of the director or agent; or after summary proceedings have been instituted, without permission from the court. If the embargo shall be removed by the director or by the court, neither the director nor the state shall be held liable for damages because of such embargo in the event that the court shall find that there was probable cause for the embargo.\n\n(f) Such proceeding shall be by complaint, verified by affidavit, which may be made on information and belief in the name of the director or agent against the article to be confiscated.\n\n(g) The complaint shall contain: (1) a particular description of the article, (2) the name of the place where the article is located, (3) the name of the person in whose possession or custody the article was found, if such name be known to the person making the complaint or can be ascertained by reasonable effort, and (4) a statement as to the manner in which the article is adulterated or misbranded or the characteristics which render its distribution or sale illegal.\n\n(h) Upon the filing of the verified complaint, the court shall issue a warrant directed to the proper officer to seize and take in his possession the article described in the complaint and bring the same before the court who issued the warrant and to summon the person named in the warrant, and any other person who may be found in possession of the article, to appear at the time and place therein specified.\n\n(i) Any such person shall be summoned by service of a copy of the warrant in the same manner as a summons issuing out of the court in which the warrant has been issued.\n\n(j) The hearing upon the complaint shall be at the time and place specified in the warrant, which time shall not be less than five (5) days or more than fifteen (15) days from the date of issuing the warrant, but, if the execution and service of the warrant has been less than three (3) days before the return of the warrant, either party shall be entitled to a reasonable continuance. Upon the hearing the complaint may be amended.\n\n(k) Any person who shall appear and claim the food, drug, device, or cosmetic seized under the warrant shall be required to file a claim in writing.\n\n(l) If, upon the hearing, it shall appear that the article was offered or exposed for sale, or was in possession with intent to distribute or sell, or was intended for distribution or sale, in violation of any provision of this act, it shall be confiscated and disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct, but no such article shall be sold contrary to any provision of this act. The proceeds of any sale, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the state treasury.\n\n[37-118, added 1959, ch. 153, sec. 6, p. 351; am. 1974, ch. 23, sec. 17, p. 633.]",
