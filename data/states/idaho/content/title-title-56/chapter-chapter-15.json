(1) There is hereby created in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known as the nursing facility assessment fund, hereinafter the \"fund,\" to be administered by the department. The state treasurer shall invest idle moneys in the fund and any interest received on those investments shall be returned to the fund.\n\n(2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:\n\n(a) All moneys collected or received by the department from nursing facility assessments required pursuant to this chapter;\n\n(b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys deposited in the fund;\n\n(c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the administration of this chapter; and\n\n(d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from any other sources.\n\n(3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accordance with this section. Collected assessment funds shall be used to secure federal matching funds available through the state medicaid plan, which funds shall be used to make medicaid payments for nursing facility services that equal or exceed the amount of nursing facility medicaid rates, in the aggregate, as calculated in accordance with the approved state medicaid plan in effect on June 30, 2009. The fund shall be used exclusively for the following purposes:\n\n(a) To pay administrative expenses incurred by the department or its agent in performing the activities authorized pursuant to this chapter, provided that such expenses shall not exceed a total of one percent (1%) of the aggregate assessment funds collected for the prior fiscal year.\n\n(b) To reimburse the medicaid share of the assessment in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.10.264.\n\n(c) To provide financial incentives for nursing facilities to improve quality to be implemented as value-based purchasing payments in state fiscal year 2021 based on performance data from the prior state fiscal year.\n\n(d) To increase nursing facility payments to fund covered services to medicaid beneficiaries within medicare upper payment limits, as negotiated with the department.\n\n(e) To repay the federal government any excess payments made to nursing facilities if the state plan, once approved by CMS, is subsequently disapproved for any reason, and after the state has appealed the findings. Nursing facilities shall refund the excess payments in question to the assessment fund. The state, in turn, shall return funds to both the federal government and nursing facility providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Individual nursing facilities shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the individual nursing facility’s assessment to the total assessment paid by nursing facilities. If a nursing facility is unable to refund payments, the state shall develop a payment plan and deduct moneys from future medicaid payments. The state will refund the federal government for the federal share of these overpayments.\n\n[56-1504, added 2011, ch. 164, sec. 23, p. 477; am. 2018, ch. 49, sec. 2, p. 126; am. 2025, ch. 82, sec. 70, p. 373.]",
