Provided, that where there has been a district court order, the debt shall be limited to the amount provided for by said order. The department shall have the right to petition the appropriate district court for modification of a district court order on the same grounds as a party to said cause.

This act is dependent upon ongoing operating and personnel appropriations.\n\n(3) Unless expressly required by federal law, the department of health and welfare shall obtain specific authorization from the legislature before seeking, applying for, accepting, or renewing any waiver of work requirements established by the supplemental nutrition assistance program under 7 U.S.C. 2015(o).\n\n(4) The department of health and welfare may not exercise the state’s option to provide any exemptions from the work requirement under 7 U.S.C. 2015(o)(6)(E).\n\n(5)(a) Under the authority given to a state agency to operate the general work requirement pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2015(d), the department of health and welfare shall assign all individuals who are over the age of seventeen (17) years and under the age of sixty (60) years to an employment and training program as defined in 7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(4), unless the individual is:\n\n(i) Currently subject to and complying with a work registration requirement under title IV of the social security act, as amended, or the federal-state unemployment insurance system, in which case, failure by such person to comply with any work requirement to which such person is subject shall be the same as failure to comply with the general work requirement;\n\n(ii) A parent or other member of a household with responsibility for the care of a dependent child under the age of six (6) years or of an incapacitated person;\n\n(iii) A bona fide student enrolled at least half-time in any recognized school, training program, or institution of higher education, except any such person enrolled in an institution of higher education who is ineligible to participate under 7 U.S.C. 2015(d);\n\n(iv) A regular participant in a drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation program;\n\n(v) Employed a minimum of thirty (30) hours per week or receiving weekly earnings that equal the minimum hourly rate under the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended, multiplied by thirty (30) hours; or\n\n(vi) A person between the ages of sixteen (16) and eighteen (18) years who is not a head of a household or who is attending school, or enrolled in an employment training program, on at least a half-time basis.\n\n(b) The department of health and welfare may develop a list of additional state-specific exemptions from participation, such as but not necessarily including exemptions for lack of transportation or pregnancy, but may not, in any fiscal year, provide exemptions to a number of individuals equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of work registrants enrolled the previous fiscal year without first obtaining specific authorization from the legislature to do so.\n\n(c) In the event that the director of the department of health and welfare finds that employment and training assignments cannot be funded or provided to all individuals subject to such assignment under this section, the director shall:\n\n(i) Submit a report within fourteen (14) days of first failing to make a required assignment to all members of the legislature and the governor containing:\n\n1. An attestation that the department has expended the state’s biennial employment and training grant from the federal government;\n\n2. An attestation that the department has received and expended its able-bodied adults without dependents pledge funding from the federal government;\n\n3. A detailed explanation of the cost-saving measures considered and taken to increase the number of assignments, including online training, work experience components, or work partnerships, and why additional assignments cannot be made within existing funding streams despite those measures;\n\n4. Recommendations for additional funding sources related to workforce training that would be more effectively used to increase workforce participation by directing funds toward employment and training assignments or an explanation for why such redirection from other funding sources would not be more effective to that end;\n\n5. The percentage of work registrants assigned to an employment and training program in the previous month, to be updated and resubmitted monthly to all members of the legislature and the governor; and\n\n6. A plan for how the department plans to restart assignments for all individuals subject to assignment within six (6) months without additional funding using more scalable and affordable employment and training assignments, such as participation in online training, work experience components, or work partnerships;\n\n(ii) Provide updates to all members of the legislature and the governor every thirty (30) days as to the metrics and plans submitted in the first report for as long as the department is failing to make all such required assignments; and\n\n(iii) Continue to assign as many individuals subject to the requirement as possible, prioritizing adults without dependents who have been enrolled for more than one (1) year.\n\n(d) The department may not stop making assignments or decline to assign any individual to an employment and training program because the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents under 7 U.S.C. 2015(o) has been suspended or waived partially or wholly by the department, state, or federal government.\n\n[56-205, added 2014, ch. 322, sec. 1, p. 800; am. 2023, ch. 227, sec. 1, p. 699.]",

(1) Medical assistance shall be awarded to persons as mandated by federal law, and medical assistance may be awarded to such other persons not required to be awarded medical assistance as mandated by federal law when such award is to the fiscal advantage of the state of Idaho.\n\n(2) There is hereby created in the dedicated fund the medical assistance account. The medical assistance account shall be an entity primarily designed to receive moneys from the families and relatives of patients receiving medical assistance under the state plan for medicaid and to provide a source of moneys to pay for the state’s share of medical assistance expenses. Moneys in the medical assistance account may not be commingled with moneys in the cooperative welfare fund. Moneys in the medical assistance account must be appropriated in order to be expended to pay for the state’s share of medical assistance expenses.\n\n(3) In all cases where the department of health and welfare through the medical assistance program has or will be required to pay medical expenses for a recipient and that recipient is entitled to recover any or all such medical expenses from any third party or entity, the department of health and welfare will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient to the extent of the amount of medical assistance benefits paid by the department as the result of the occurrence giving rise to the claim against the third party or entity.\n\n(4) If a recipient of medical assistance pursues a claim against a third party or entity through litigation or a settlement, the recipient will so notify the department. If a recipient fails to notify the department of such claim, the department may recover the amount of any public assistance obtained by the recipient while the recipient pursued such claim. In addition, if the recipient recovers funds, either by settlement or judgment, from such a third party or entity, the recipient shall reimburse the department to the extent of the funds received in settlement, minus attorney’s fees and costs, the amount of the medical assistance benefits paid by the department on his behalf as a result of the occurrence giving rise to the need for medical assistance. The department shall be entitled to all the legal rights and powers of a creditor against a debtor in enforcing the recipient’s reimbursement obligation.\n\n(5) The department shall have priority to any amount received from a third party or entity that can reasonably be construed to compensate the recipient for the occurrence giving rise to the need for medical assistance, whether the settlement or judgment is obtained through the subrogation right of the department or through recovery by the recipient, and whether or not the recipient is made whole by the amount recovered. The department will be entitled to reimbursement of medical assistance benefits paid on behalf of the recipient arising from the incident or occurrence prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. The department may notify such third party or entity of the department’s entitlement to receive the reimbursement prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. Furthermore, the department may instruct the third party or entity to make such payment directly to the department prior to any amount being distributed to the recipient. Any third party or entity who distributed funds in violation of such a notice shall be liable to the department for the amount of the reimbursement.\n\n(6) In the event a recipient of assistance through the medical assistance program incurs the obligation to pay attorney’s fees and costs for the purpose of enforcing a monetary claim to which the department has a right under this section, the amount that the department is entitled to recover, or any lesser amount that the department may agree to accept in compromise of its claim, shall be reduced by an amount that bears the same relation to the total amount of attorney’s fees and costs actually paid by the recipient as the amount actually recovered for medical expenses paid by the department, exclusive of the reduction for attorney’s fees and costs, bears to the total amount paid by the third party or entity to the recipient. If a settlement or judgment is received by the recipient without delineating what portion of the settlement or judgment is in payment of medical expenses, it will be presumed that the settlement or judgment applies first to the medical expenses incurred by the recipient in an amount equal to the expenditure for medical assistance benefits paid by the department as a result of the occurrence giving rise to the payment or payments to the recipient.\n\n(7) If a responsible third party requires prior authorization for an item or service provided to a recipient of medical assistance, the responsible third party shall accept an authorization provided by the department that such item or service is covered under the state plan or applicable waiver as if such authorization was made by the third party for the item or service.\n\n[56-209b, added 1961, ch. 217, sec. 3, p. 346; am. 1966 (2nd E.S.), ch. 11, sec. 4, p. 28; am. 1973, ch. 161, sec. 2, p. 306; am. 1978, ch. 246, sec. 4, p. 539; am. 1981, ch. 201, sec. 1, p. 354; am. 1982, ch. 180, sec. 1, p. 468; am. 1996, ch. 196, sec. 1, p. 614; am. 2002, ch. 369, sec. 1, p. 1038; am. 2025, ch. 27, sec. 1, p. 85.]",

It is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this act enhance the employability of participants in the temporary assistance for families in Idaho (TAFI) programs through substance abuse screening and, where appropriate, testing and treatment. The legislature finds that a significant number of employers use preemployment drug testing. Substance abuse adds to the difficulties such individuals have in securing employment. The legislature also finds that substance abuse in and of itself impairs personal responsibility and self-sufficiency and stands in the way of the very intent of the TAFI program to care for the health and welfare of certain qualified recipients and in so doing results in welfare costs that burden the state’s taxpayers. The legislature further finds that substance abuse adversely affects a significant portion of the workforce, which results in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year and poses a threat to the safety of the workplace and to the public safety and security. In balancing the interests of taxpayers, participants in the TAFI program and potential employers against the interests of those who will be screened and tested under this act, the legislature finds that screening, testing and treatment as provided for in this act are in the greater interests of all concerned.\n\n[56-209i, added 2000, ch. 467, sec. 1, p. 1447.]",

      "text": "56-209n. MEDICAID FOR WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES. (1) The legislature finds that many individuals with disabilities would like to work but cannot afford to enter the workforce due to the fear of losing necessary medical services received through medicaid. Idaho hereby seeks to avail itself of the opportunity available through the federal ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999, which allows states to establish new medicaid eligibility categories for working people with disabilities whose income or resources would otherwise make them ineligible for medicaid. Eliminating barriers to health care and other needed services and supports and creating financial incentives to work will greatly improve the short and long-term financial independence and well-being of people with disabilities. Medicaid for workers with disabilities will serve to increase the productivity of Idaho residents with disabilities and thereby enhance the economic and fiscal status of this state.\n\n(2) An individual is eligible to participate in the medicaid for workers with disabilities program if the individual:\n\n(a) Is at least sixteen (16) years of age and not more than sixty-four (64) years of age;\n\n(b) Has a disability as defined in title XVI of the federal social security act, as amended. An individual shall be determined to be eligible under this section without regard to his or her ability to engage in, or actual engagement in, substantial gainful activity, as defined in section 223(d)(4) of the social security act (42 U.S.C. section 423(d)(4));\n\n(c) Is employed, including self-employment, and has provided the department of health and welfare with satisfactory written proof of employment. Hourly wage or hours worked shall not be used to determine employment;\n\n(d) Has countable resources of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less. In calculating resources the following items shall be excluded: a second car, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, beneficial trusts, and any other resources excluded under current rules promulgated by the department of health and welfare for aid to aged, blind and disabled (AABD); and\n\n(e) Has countable income, after exclusions and disregards as set forth in rules promulgated by the department of health and welfare for participants receiving AABD benefits, which do not exceed five hundred percent (500%) of the federal poverty level.\n\n(3) An eligible individual who has an income as determined pursuant to subsection (2)(e) of this section less than one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of the federal poverty level shall not be required to pay a premium for medicaid.\n\n(4) The department of health and welfare may require an eligible individual who has an income as determined pursuant to subsection (2)(e) of this section of one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level to pay a monthly premium as set forth in rules promulgated by the department of health and welfare.\n\n(5) An eligible individual who has an income as determined pursuant to subsection (2)(e) of this section in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level shall pay to the department of health and welfare a monthly premium as a condition for continued eligibility for medicaid. The monthly premium shall be calculated by multiplying seven and one-half percent (7.5%) by the amount of the individual’s income as determined pursuant to subsection (2)(e) of this section which is above two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level.\n\n[56-209n, added 2006, ch. 174, sec. 1, p. 533.]",
