      "text": "56-1102. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) The problem of poverty will not be solved solely by government programs and income subsidies.\n\n(2) It is in the best interest of all Idahoans to structure incentives in a way that will result in a greater likelihood that low-income and working-poor individuals will attain self-sufficiency.\n\n(3) It is in the best interest of all Idahoans to encourage low-income individuals, neighborhoods and communities to benefit from the developments achieved through the growth in assets and investments.\n\n(4) Achieving self-sufficiency and assessing economic opportunity for low-income and working-poor individuals can be addressed through public policy that invests in asset accumulation and is supported by private sector philanthropy.\n\n(5) Providing a structured savings situation for low-income and working-poor individuals enhances their chances of fulfilling major life goals and opportunities and incorporates them into the economic mainstream.\n\n(6) The state has an opportunity to take advantage of private and public resources by making the transition to an asset-based antipoverty strategy. Those resources include, but are not limited to, the assets for independence act (42 U.S.C. section 604) and the workforce investment act (P.L. 105-220).\n\n(7) Investment through an individual development account program will help lower-income households obtain the assets they need to succeed. Communities and this state will experience resultant economic and social benefits accruing from the promotion of job training and higher education, home ownership and small business development.\n\n(8) It is desirable for this state to enact legislation that enables an authorized fiduciary organization sufficient flexibility to receive private, state and federal moneys for individual development accounts. The legislature should periodically review the provisions of this chapter to ensure that this state maximizes the receipt of available federal moneys for individual development accounts.\n\n[56-1102, added 2002, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 436.]",

(1) A person who qualifies to become an account holder may enter into an agreement with a fiduciary organization for the establishment of an individual development account.\n\n(2) A person is qualified to become an account holder if the person is a member of a low-income household.\n\n(3) A person applying to establish an account must enroll in a personal development plan developed by the person and the fiduciary organization. The plan must provide the person with financial training and counseling, career or business planning and other services designed to increase the independence of the person and the person’s household through achievement of the account’s approved purpose.\n\n[56-1103, added 2002, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 437.]",

      "text": "56-1104. APPROVED PURPOSE OF ACCOUNT — EMERGENCY WITHDRAWAL — REMOVAL OF ACCOUNT HOLDER FROM PROGRAM. (1) A person may establish an individual development account only for a purpose approved by a fiduciary organization. Disbursements from an account for an approved purpose shall be made directly by the fiduciary organization on behalf of the account holder but in no event shall the fiduciary organization make a disbursement for an approved purpose directly to the account holder. Purposes that the fiduciary organization may approve are:\n\n(a) Educational costs for any family member eighteen (18) years of age or older, at an accredited institution of postsecondary education.\n\n(b) The purchase of a primary residence. In addition to payment on the purchase price of the residence, account moneys may be used to pay any usual or reasonable settlement, financing or other closing costs. The account holder must not have owned or held any interest in a residence during the three (3) years prior to making the purchase. However, this three (3) year period shall not apply to displaced homemakers or other individuals who have lost home ownership as a result of divorce.\n\n(c) The capitalization of a small business. Account moneys may be used for capital, plant, equipment and inventory expenses or for working capital pursuant to a business plan. The business plan must have been developed through a financial institution, nonprofit microenterprise program or other qualified agent demonstrating business expertise and have been approved by the fiduciary organization. The business plan must include a description of the services or goods to be sold, a marketing plan and projected financial statements.\n\n(2) (a) If an emergency occurs, an account holder may withdraw all or part of the account holder’s deposits to an individual development account for a purpose not described in subsection (1) of this section. As used in this paragraph, an approved emergency includes making payments for necessary medical expenses, to avoid eviction of the account holder from the account holder’s residence and for necessary living expenses following a loss of employment.\n\n(b) The account holder must reimburse the account for the amount withdrawn under this subsection within twelve (12) months after the date of the withdrawal. Failure of an account holder to make a timely reimbursement to the account is grounds for removing the account holder from the individual development account program. Until the reimbursement has been made in full, an account holder shall not be approved for matching funds or accrued interest on matching funds.\n\n(3) If an account holder withdraws, or directs the withdrawal, of moneys from an individual development account for other than an approved purpose, the fiduciary organization may remove the account holder from the program.\n\n(4) If an account holder moves from the area where the program is conducted or is otherwise unable to continue in the program, the fiduciary organization may remove the account holder from the program.\n\n(5) If an account holder is removed from the program under subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, the account holder shall retain moneys he or she deposited in the account, including interest earned. In the event of the death of the account holder, moneys deposited in the account by the account holder and interest earned on those deposits shall be distributed to the designated beneficiary of the account and, if there is none, then according to the laws of the state of Idaho as moneys of the estate of the account holder. If the account holder is removed from the program or in the event of the account holder’s death, all matching deposits in the account and all interest earned on matching deposits shall revert to the fiduciary organization. The fiduciary organization shall use the reverted funds as a source of matching deposits for other accounts.\n\n[56-1104, added 2002, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 437.]",

(1) The fiduciary organization shall structure the accounts to have the following features:\n\n(a) The fiduciary organization matches amounts deposited by the account holder according to a formula established by the fiduciary organization. The fiduciary organization shall deposit not less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than five dollars ($5.00) into the account for each one dollar ($1.00) deposited by the account holder.\n\n(b) The matching deposits by the fiduciary organization to the individual development account are placed in a savings account that is controlled by the fiduciary organization and held separately from the savings account of the account holder.\n\n(2) Deposits by a fiduciary organization to an account shall not exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000) in any twelve (12) month period.\n\n(3) The total amount paid into an individual development account during its existence, including amounts from deposits, matching deposits and interest or investment earnings, may not exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create an entitlement to matching moneys. The number of individuals who may receive disbursement of matching philanthropic moneys by sponsoring organizations pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall necessarily be limited by the amount of philanthropic moneys available in any given year for such purpose.\n\n[56-1105, added 2002, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 438.]",
