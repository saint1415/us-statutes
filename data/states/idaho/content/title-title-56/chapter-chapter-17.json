The Idaho legislature recognizes the need for the department of health and welfare to prepare for various public health crises and natural disasters and carry out response activities when a public health crisis or natural disaster occurs. The legislature recognizes the legitimacy of preparing emergency plans and guidance to provide the most benefit possible when health care resources are limited as a result of a public health crisis or natural disaster. However, the department of health and welfare is charged with the responsibility of limiting the duration and scope of operating in crisis standards of care by using all measures that are available and within its authority. The department is further charged with the responsibility of developing long-term capacity strategies to reasonably prepare for future surges in health care demand. Such strategies shall recognize the pace of Idaho’s population growth.\n\n[56-1702, added 2022, ch. 253, sec. 1, p. 829.]",

For purposes of this subsection, a restriction is reasonable if the restriction:\n\n(a) Is necessary to prevent the disruption of assistance or health care services to the patient or resident; and\n\n(b) Does not interfere with the patient’s or resident’s general right to visitation by an essential caregiver.\n\n[56-1705, added 2022, ch. 253, sec. 1, p. 830.]",
