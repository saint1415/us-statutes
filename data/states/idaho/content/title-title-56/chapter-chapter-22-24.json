Departmental representatives shall issue a written report of audit findings, list items requiring a laboratory response, and specify the response time frame required to maintain certification.\n\n(2) Test results shall be submitted in a format approved by the department of environmental quality and shall be reported to the department of environmental quality, or the department’s designee, no later than ten (10) business days after the completion of testing or upon receipt of results from subcontracted laboratories.\n\n(3) As soon as feasible, a laboratory shall notify the department of environmental quality, or the department’s designee, of any nitrate and nitrate level exceeding the current maximum contaminant level. Notification shall also be made for any other regulated chemical or radiological contaminant that exceeds four (4) times the maximum contaminant level. Notification requirements apply to any samples subcontracted to another laboratory.\n\n(4) A laboratory shall notify the department of environmental quality, or the department’s designee, of any total coliform positive result by the end of the day, unless the positive result is obtained after the department of environmental quality is closed and the department of environmental quality does not have either an after-hours phone line or an alternative notification procedure, in which case the laboratory shall notify the department of environmental quality before the end of the next business day.\n\n[56-2204 [56-2404], added 2025, ch. 84, sec. 13, p. 398.]",
