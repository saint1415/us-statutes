      "text": "62-602. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby finds that universally available telecommunications services are essential to the health, welfare and economic well-being of the citizens of the state of Idaho and there is a need for establishing legislation to protect and maintain high-quality universal telecommunications at just and reasonable rates for all classes of customers and to encourage innovation within the industry by a balanced program of regulation and competition.\n\n(2) It is the intent of this legislature that effective competition throughout a local exchange calling area will involve a significant number of customers having both service provider and service option choices and that actual competition means more than the mere presence of a competitor. Instead, for there to be actual and effective competition there needs to be substantive and meaningful competition throughout the incumbent telephone corporation’s local exchange calling area.\n\n(3) It is the further intent of the legislature that the commission, in its deliberation of deregulation of the incumbent telephone corporations, will examine the impact such deregulation will have on the public interest in accordance with the general grant of authority given to the commission by the legislature and that all parties be allowed to comment thereon in such proceeding.\n\n(4) The legislature further finds that the telecommunications industry is in a state of transition from a regulated public utility industry to a competitive industry. The legislature encourages the development of open competition in the telecommunications industry in accordance with provisions of Idaho law and consistent with the federal telecommunications act of 1996.\n\n(5) The commission shall administer these statutes with respect to telecommunication rates and services in accordance with these policies and applicable federal law.\n\n(6) The legislature further finds that it is consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity that the obligation of certain rural telephone companies to comply with the requirements of section 251(c) of the telecommunications act of 1996 should be suspended upon petition of the affected telephone company, based upon the following legislative findings that the suspension is necessary:\n\n(a) To avoid a significant economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally in areas served by the rural telephone companies;\n\n(b) To avoid imposing requirements that are unduly economically burdensome; or\n\n(c) To avoid imposing requirements which are technically infeasible.\n\n[62-602, added 1988, ch. 195, sec. 1, p. 359; am. 1997, ch. 192, sec. 2, p. 540.]",

(1) A telephone corporation which held a certificate of public convenience and necessity on January 1, 1988, may file with the commission a notice that such telephone corporation elects to be subject to the provisions of this chapter for all, or part of its telecommunication services, which notice shall include the following:\n\n(a) The name and address of the telephone corporation;\n\n(b) A narrative description of the telecommunication services provided by the telephone corporation and the geographic area and market served by the telephone corporation and a description of the telecommunication services for which the election is made.\n\n(2) Upon the expiration of thirty (30) days from the filing of such notice of election, said telephone corporation shall, as to telecommunication services set forth in the notice of election, be exempt from the provisions of title 61, Idaho Code, and such telecommunication services shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this chapter with the exception of the provisions of section 62-622(1) through (3), Idaho Code.\n\n(3) Nothing contained in the provisions of this chapter or title 61, Idaho Code, shall be construed to prevent any person or entity from providing telecommunication services in competition with a telephone corporation as to those services which have been excluded from regulation under title 61, Idaho Code, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or with a telephone corporation, other than a mutual, nonprofit or cooperative telephone corporation, which was not, on the effective date of this act, subject to regulation by the commission pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) Nothing contained in the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to prevent any telephone corporation from maintaining on file with the commission a tariff or price list describing the details of its services.\n\n(5) (a) For any telecommunication service which was subject, on July 1, 1988, to title 61, Idaho Code, and which at the election of the telephone corporation became subject to this chapter, the commission shall have continuing authority to regulate the telephone corporation to the extent necessary to implement the federal communications act of 1996, in accordance with section 62-615, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) The commission shall have the continuing authority to determine the noneconomic regulatory requirements relating to basic local exchange service for all telephone corporations providing basic local exchange service including, but not limited to, such matters as service quality standards, provision of access to carriers providing message telecommunication service, filing of price lists, customer notice and customer relation rules, and billing practices and procedures, which requirements shall be technologically and competitively neutral.\n\n(c) In addition, if a telephone corporation has made an election pursuant to section 62-604, Idaho Code, and this section with reference to basic local exchange service, the maximum price the telephone corporation may charge for stand-alone basic local exchange service, as defined in section 62-607A, Idaho Code, during the transition period, shall, in the first year of the transition period, be capped at a rate ten percent (10%) above the rate in effect at the time of the election. Thereafter, in each succeeding year of the transition period, the price cap shall be increased by an additional amount that is equal to the difference between the rate at the time of the election and the price cap established hereunder for the first year of the transition period. However, during the transition period, the price cap established herein shall in no event exceed the maximum basic local exchange rate that was in effect and authorized or approved by the commission for any telephone corporation regulated pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code, or section 62-622(1), Idaho Code, for residence and business basic local exchange service rates, respectively, on the date the telephone corporation made the election pursuant to section 62-604, Idaho Code, and this section with reference to basic local exchange service.\n\n(d) The term \"transition period,\" as used in this section, means a period of three (3) years from the effective date of the election by a telephone corporation to exclude basic local exchange services from regulation pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code, or section 62-622(1), Idaho Code.

The commission shall, if the transition period is extended, as herein provided, file a copy of the commission’s order with the governor and the legislature.\n\n(e) For the purpose of calculating the weighted statewide average rates for residence and business basic local exchange service rates to enable the commission to determine eligibility for distributions to eligible telecommunications carriers from the universal service fund established pursuant to chapter 6, title 62, Idaho Code, the residence and business basic local exchange rates in effect on July 1, 2005, shall constitute the basis for such calculation, unless the commission determines that changes in basic local exchange rates subsequent to July 1, 2005, should be used for such calculation for the purpose of determining the eligibility of telecommunications carriers for distributions from the universal service fund.\n\n[62-605, added 1988, ch. 195, sec. 1, p. 361; am. 2005, ch. 200, sec. 2, p. 606.]",

(1) The commission shall regulate the prices for basic local exchange services for incumbent telephone corporations in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(a) At the request of the incumbent telephone corporation, the commission shall establish maximum just and reasonable rates for basic local exchange service. Maximum basic local exchange rates shall be sufficient to recover the costs incurred to provide the services. Costs shall include authorized depreciation, a reasonable portion of shared and common costs, and a reasonable profit. Authorized depreciation lives shall use forward-looking competitive market lives. Authorized depreciation lives shall be applied prospectively and to undepreciated balances.\n\n(b) At the request of the telephone corporation, the commission may find that existing rates for local services constitute the maximum rates.\n\n(c) The commission shall issue its order establishing maximum rates no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the filing of the request unless the telephone corporation consents to a longer period.\n\n(d) An incumbent telephone corporation may charge prices lower than the maximum basic local exchange rates established by the commission. Provided however, upon the petition of a nonincumbent telephone corporation, the commission shall establish a minimum price for the incumbent telephone corporation’s basic local exchange service if the commission finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the incumbent telephone corporation’s prices for basic local exchange services in the local exchange area are below the incumbent telephone corporation’s average variable cost of providing such services.\n\n(e) After the commission has established maximum basic local exchange rates, an incumbent telephone corporation may change its tariffs or price lists reflecting the availability, price, terms and conditions for local exchange service effective not less than ten (10) days after filing with the commission and giving notice to affected customers. Changes to tariffs or price lists that are for nonrecurring services and that are quoted directly to the customer when an order for service is placed, or changes that result in price reductions or new service offerings, shall be effective immediately upon filing with the commission and no other notice shall be required.\n\n(2) The commission shall not regulate the prices for basic local exchange services for telephone corporations that were not providing such local service on or before February 8, 1996. Provided however, such telephone corporation providing basic local exchange services shall file price lists with the commission that reflect the availability, price, terms and conditions for such services. Changes to such price lists shall be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing with the commission and giving notice to affected customers. Changes to price lists that are for nonrecurring services and that are quoted directly to the customer when an order for service is placed, or changes that result in price reductions or new service offerings, shall be effective immediately upon filing with the commission and no other notice shall be required. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection and subsection (1) of this section, telephone corporations that are subject to the provisions of this subsection shall not be required to file tariffs or price lists for basic local exchange services provided to business customers.\n\nUpon written notice to the commission and to its business customers, and after posting the rates, terms and conditions of its services on the carrier’s public website, a telephone corporation may withdraw any tariff or price list not required to be filed under the provisions of this section, provided:\n\n(a) The carrier continues to maintain the rates, terms and conditions of its services on the company’s public website;\n\n(b) The commission maintains access to such terms and conditions on the telephone corporation’s service; and\n\n(c) Nothing in this section overrides the commission’s existing authority pursuant to section 62-616, Idaho Code, to resolve customer complaints.\n\n(3) The commission shall cease regulating basic local exchange rates in a local exchange calling area upon a showing by an incumbent telephone corporation that effective competition exists for basic local exchange service throughout the local exchange calling area. Effective competition exists throughout a local exchange calling area when either:\n\n(a) Actual competition from a facilities-based competitor is present for both residential and small business basic local exchange customers; or\n\n(b) There are functionally equivalent, competitively priced local services reasonably available to both residential and small business customers from a telephone corporation unaffiliated with the incumbent telephone corporation.\n\n(4) Telephone corporations shall not resell:\n\n(a) A telecommunications service that is available at retail only to a category of subscribers to a different category of subscribers;\n\n(b) A means-tested service to ineligible customers; or\n\n(c) A category of service to circumvent switched or special access charges.\n\n(5) The commission shall determine the noneconomic regulatory requirements for all telephone corporations providing basic local exchange service or designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier pursuant to sections 62-610A through 62-610F, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to, such matters as service quality standards, provision of access to carriers providing message telecommunications service, filing of price lists, customer notice and customer relation rules.\n\n[62-622, added 1997, ch. 192, sec. 8, p. 544; am. 1999, ch. 114, sec. 6, p. 346; am. 2011, ch. 312, sec. 2, p. 905.]",

A telephone corporation may file a petition with the commission alleging that another telephone corporation, not subject to regulation pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code, is offering basic local exchange service to customers in a local exchange calling area at a price below its average variable cost of providing such service in the local exchange calling area. The commission shall, if after hearing it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the allegations contained in the petition are true, establish a minimum price for basic local exchange service of the telephone corporation in the local exchange calling area, which minimum price shall reflect the telephone corporation’s average variable cost of providing such service.\n\n[62-622A, added 2005, ch. 200, sec. 6, p. 609.]",
