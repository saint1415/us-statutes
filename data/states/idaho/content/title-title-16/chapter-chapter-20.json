      "text": "16-2001. PURPOSE. (1) The purpose of this chapter is to:\n\n(a) Provide for voluntary and involuntary severance of the parent and child relationship and for substitution of parental care and supervision by judicial process, thereby safeguarding the rights and interests of all parties concerned and promoting their welfare and that of the state of Idaho; and\n\n(b) Provide permanency for children who are under the jurisdiction of the court through the child protective act, chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code, where the court has found the existence of aggravated circumstances or that reasonable efforts to return the child to his or her home have failed.\n\n(2) Implicit in this chapter is the philosophy that wherever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved and that the issue of severing the parent and child relationship is of such vital importance as to require a judicial determination in place of attempts at severance by contractual arrangements, express or implied, for the surrender and relinquishment of children. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination in favor of, or against, on the basis of disability.\n\n[16-2001, added 1963, ch. 145, sec. 1, p. 420; am. 2002, ch. 233, sec. 8, p. 677; am. 2005, ch. 391, sec. 46, p. 1295.]",

Chronic neglect or chronic abuse of a child shall consist of abuse or neglect that is so extreme or repetitious as to indicate continuing the relationship would result in unacceptable risk to the health and welfare of the child;\n\n(ii) Sexual abuse against a child of the parent. Sexual abuse, for the purposes of this section, includes any conduct described in section 18-1506, 18-1506A, 18-1507, 18-1508, 18-1508A, 18-6101, or 18-6604, Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) Torture of a child; any conduct described in the code sections listed in section 18-8303(1), Idaho Code; battery or an injury to a child that results in serious or great bodily injury to a child; voluntary manslaughter of a child, or aiding or abetting such voluntary manslaughter, soliciting such voluntary manslaughter or attempting or conspiring to commit such voluntary manslaughter;\n\n(iv) The parent has committed murder, aided or abetted a murder, solicited a murder or attempted or conspired to commit murder; or\n\n(c) The court determines the child to be an abandoned infant, except in a parental termination action brought by one (1) parent against another parent.\n\n(3) The court shall not grant an order terminating the relationship based on the child’s immunization status.\n\n(4) The court may grant an order terminating the relationship if termination is found to be in the best interest of the parent and child.\n\n(5) The court may grant an order terminating the relationship where a consent to termination in the manner and form prescribed by this chapter has been filed by the parent or parents of the child in conjunction with a petition for adoption initiated by the person or persons proposing to adopt the child, where the consent to termination has been filed by a licensed adoption agency, or where the termination is initiated by the department pertaining to a child who is in the legal custody of the department, and no subsequent hearing on the merits of the petition shall be held.

In a state where the father has failed to file notice of claim to paternity and willingness to assume responsibility as provided for pursuant to the laws of such state, and where such failure constitutes an abandonment of such child and constitutes a termination or relinquishment of the rights of the putative father, the court shall accept such failure as a termination in this state without further hearing on the merits if the court is satisfied that such failure constitutes a termination or relinquishment of parental rights pursuant to the laws of that state.\n\n(8) The court shall hold a hearing unless:\n\n(a) A consent to termination signed by the parent or parents of the child has been filed by an adoption agency licensed in the state of Idaho;\n\n(b) A consent to termination was filed in conjunction with a petition for adoption of the child; or\n\n(c) A consent to termination signed by the parent or parents of the child has been filed and the termination is initiated by the department pertaining to a child who is in legal custody of the department.\n\n(9) If the parent has a disability, as defined in this chapter, the parent shall have the right to provide evidence to the court regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligation on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities.\n\n[16-2005, added 1963, ch. 145, sec. 5, p. 420; am. 1971, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 1067; am. 1987, ch. 207, sec. 1, p. 436; am. 1990, ch. 25, sec. 1, p. 38; am. 1994, ch. 393, sec. 4, p. 1248; am. 1994, ch. 426, sec. 2, p. 1336; am. 1996, ch. 365, sec. 2, p. 1224; am. 1998, ch. 310, sec. 1, p. 1028; am. 1999, ch. 314, sec. 1, p. 779; am. 2000, ch. 77, sec. 1, p. 161; am. 2000, ch. 171, sec. 9, p. 435; am. 2002, ch. 233, sec. 10, p. 680; am. 2003, ch. 260, sec. 1, p. 683; am. 2005, ch. 391, sec. 49, p. 1298; am. 2013, ch. 287, sec. 12, p. 758; am. 2016, ch. 296, sec. 7, p. 834; am. 2022, ch. 124, sec. 11, p. 444; am. 2023, ch. 10, sec. 2, p. 34; am. 2025, ch. 130, sec. 3, p. 679; am. 2025, ch. 206, sec. 1, p. 930.]",

The department of health and welfare or the licensed children’s adoption agency shall have thirty (30) days from notification by the court during which it shall complete and submit its investigation unless an extension of time is granted by the court upon application by the agency. The court may order additional investigation as it deems necessary. The social study shall include the circumstances of the petition, the investigation, the present condition of the child and parents, proposed plans for the child, and such other facts as may be pertinent to the parent and child relationship, and the report submitted shall include a recommendation and the reasons therefor as to whether or not the parent and child relationship should be terminated. If the parent has a disability as defined in this chapter, the parent shall have the right, as a part of the social study, to provide information regarding the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. The person performing the social investigation shall advise the parent of such right and shall consider all such information in any findings or recommendations. The social study shall be conducted by, or with the assistance of, an individual with expertise in the use of such equipment and services. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligations on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities. Where the parent is a minor, if the report does not include a statement of contact with the parents of said minor, the reasons therefor shall be set forth. The purpose of the investigation is to aid the court in making disposition of the petition and shall be considered by the court prior thereto.\n\n(3) Except as provided in section 16-1504(6), Idaho Code, no social study or investigation as provided for in subsection (2) of this section shall be directed by the court with respect to the putative father who has failed to timely commence proceedings to establish paternity under section 7-1111, Idaho Code, or who has failed to timely file notice of his filing of proceedings to establish his paternity of his child born out of wedlock under section 16-1513, Idaho Code, with the vital statistics unit of the department of health and welfare, unless such putative father is one of those persons specifically set forth in section 16-1505(1), Idaho Code.\n\n[16-2008, added 1963, ch. 145, sec. 8, p. 420; am. 1985, ch. 55, sec. 1, p. 109; am. 1987, ch. 207, sec. 3, p. 438; am. 1992, ch. 341, sec. 3, p. 1035; am. 2000, ch. 171, sec. 11, p. 439; am. 2002, ch. 233, sec. 12, p. 683; am. 2013, ch. 138, sec. 7, p. 332; am. 2020, ch. 330, sec. 6, p. 962.]",
