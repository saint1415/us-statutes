      "text": "16-2402. LEGISLATIVE PURPOSES. (1) It is the policy of the legislature and the state of Idaho that services for children with serious emotional disturbance should be planned and implemented to maximize the support of the family’s ability to provide adequate safety and well-being for the child at home. If the child cannot receive adequate services within the family home to maintain individual safety and well-being, community resources shall be provided to minimize the need for institutional or other residential placement. The legislature finds that family involvement and participation in the child’s treatment planning and implementation is vital to successful intervention for children with serious emotional disturbance.\n\n(2) Services to address mental health needs are one part of a broad array of services which should be available to Idaho’s children with special needs. Such services shall maximize the preservation of the family, by coordination and collaboration of services with schools and community. The department of health and welfare, the department of education, the department of juvenile corrections, school districts, counties and any other appropriate entities, shall cooperate and collaborate in planning, developing and providing services, and shall consult with counties and private providers of mental health services.\n\n(3) Services shall be individually planned to meet the unique needs of each child and family. Such planning shall include the parent, guardian or surrogate parent(s) of each child. The continuum of services shall include, but not be limited to, individual and family counseling, crisis intervention services, day treatment, respite care, therapeutic foster homes, family support services, residential treatment and inpatient services. These services shall be available to meet the needs of Idaho’s children with serious emotional disturbance or mental illness and their families. Services shall be provided without requiring that parents relinquish custody of the child.\n\n(4) This chapter is intended to achieve, and shall be construed to promote, these legislative purposes:\n\n(a) To empower families of children with serious emotional disturbance to determine their own needs and to make decisions and choices, concerning them;\n\n(b) To give families of children with serious emotional disturbance the support they need, to maintain a stable, nurturing home environment for the children, and to respond to the needs of the entire family, without requiring families to accept services that they do not desire or seek;\n\n(c) To utilize out-of-home placement only after families are provided supportive services and those services are inadequate to provide a reasonable level of safety and well-being for the child and family, or when an emergency exists which requires immediate intervention. Any placement of a child out of home shall follow the principles of least restrictive alternative placement as defined in this chapter and shall be for the shortest period of time necessary to provide for the safety and well-being of the child and family;\n\n(d) To plan, develop, deliver, and evaluate services for children with serious emotional disturbance in an efficient, coordinated and collaborative statewide system, of individualized services;\n\n(e) To provide services in settings that are close to the patterns and norms of society and sensitive to the regional, cultural, and ethnic characteristics of Idaho’s families and communities;\n\n(f) To provide services for families as close to their home communities as possible and to promote integration of families into their communities;\n\n(g) To make use of the capacities of local communities to complement existing public and private community resources, including natural and informal supports provided by family and friends;\n\n(h) To give priority to planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating children’s mental health services to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce the impact of serious emotional disturbance on families;\n\n(i) To assist all state and local public and private agencies and service providers to provide appropriate, flexible, and cost-effective home and community-based services for families;\n\n(j) All state agencies providing services to children with serious emotional disturbances prior to the passage of this chapter shall maintain their existing level of services to this population.\n\n(5) All department and private providers acting under this chapter shall:\n\n(a) Identify and coordinate all available resources, both formal and informal, public and private, so that the needs of families can be met and their strengths can be applied;\n\n(b) Include participation of families with children with serious emotional disturbance in all phases of planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating the programs that affect them;\n\n(c) Be flexible, so that families will have power to decide what services to use, how to use them, and how often to use them;\n\n(d) Apply a family centered approach in working with families;\n\n(e) Respect a family’s method of problem solving and their preferred methods of communication;\n\n(f) Be sensitive to families’ social, economic, physical and other environments;\n\n(g) Disseminate information so that eligible families will know of the availability of services;\n\n(h) Provide services in a manner to ensure uninterrupted and consistent availability of services between children’s and adult services when the child reaches the age of majority;\n\n(i) Refrain from any discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or disabling condition in the employment of individuals, and in providing services.\n\n[16-2402, added 1997, ch. 404, sec. 1, p. 1282.]",

A health care professional may detain a child if such person determines that an emergency situation exists as defined in this chapter, and such person has probable cause to believe that the child is suffering from a serious emotional disturbance as a result of which he is likely to cause harm to himself or others or is manifestly unable to preserve his health or safety with the supports and assistance available to him and that immediate detention and treatment is necessary to prevent harm to the child or others. If the hospital does not have an appropriate facility to provide emergency mental health care, it may cause the child to be transported to an appropriate treatment facility. The health care professional shall notify the parent or legal guardian, if known, as soon as possible and shall document in the patient’s chart the efforts to contact the parent or legal guardian. If the parent or legal guardian cannot be located or contacted, the health care professional shall cause a report to be filed as soon as possible and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours with the Idaho department of health and welfare or an appropriate law enforcement agency. The child may not be detained against the parent or legal guardian’s explicit direction unless the child is taken into protective custody pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, except that the child may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary for a peace officer to be summoned to the hospital to make a determination under subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(3) If a child has been taken into protective custody by a peace officer under the provisions of this section, the officer shall immediately transport the child to a treatment facility or mental health program, such as a regional mental health center, a mobile crisis intervention program, or a therapeutic foster care facility, provided such center’s program or facility has been approved by the regional office of the department for that purpose. The department shall make a list of approved facilities available to law enforcement agencies.\n\n(4) Upon taking the child into protective custody or detaining the child pursuant to this section, the officer or health care professional shall take reasonable precautions to safeguard and preserve the personal property of the child unless a parent or guardian or responsible relative is able to do so. Upon presenting a child to a treatment facility, the officer shall inform the staff in writing of the facts that caused him to detain the child and shall specifically state whether the child is otherwise subject to being held for juvenile or criminal offenses.\n\n(5) If the child who is being detained by a peace officer is not released to the child’s parent, guardian or custodian, the law enforcement agency shall contact the child’s parent, guardian or custodian as soon as possible, and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours, and shall notify the child’s parent, guardian or custodian of his status, location and the reasons for the detention of the child. If the parents cannot be located or contacted, efforts to comply with this section and the reasons for failure to make contact shall be documented in the child’s record.\n\n[16-2411, added 1997, ch. 404, sec. 1, p. 1288; am. 2013, ch. 293, sec. 1, p. 770.]",
