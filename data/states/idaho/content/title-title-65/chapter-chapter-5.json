      "text": "65-501. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. It is the intent of the legislature to honor veterans of the armed forces by providing preference in initial appointments to public sector jobs in Idaho. Veterans’ preference is intended to honor those citizens who have served their country in active duty by providing veterans a more favorable competitive position for government employment and acknowledging the larger sacrifice of disabled veterans. Eligible veterans are provided advantages in public employment in Idaho, including preference for initial employment and retention in the event of layoffs. Veterans’ preference requires public employers to provide additional consideration for eligible veterans, but it does not guarantee the veteran a job.\n\n[65-501, added 2006, ch. 51, sec. 1, p. 145; am. 2013, ch. 187, sec. 16, p. 464.]",

(1) Public employers must give notice in all announcements and advertisements of vacancies that preference in appointment will be given to preference applicants. Application forms must inquire whether the applicant is claiming veterans’ preference and whether the applicant has previously claimed such a preference. An applicant claiming preference is responsible for providing required documentation at the time of making application. The employer must inform applicants of the requirements for documentation.\n\n(2) In all public employment, excluding key employee positions, the hiring official shall give preference to preference eligible applicants.\n\n(3) An application for appointment to a position will be accepted after the closing date of the examination from an applicant who was serving in the armed forces, or undergoing service-connected hospitalization up to one (1) year following discharge. The application must be submitted within one hundred twenty (120) days of the applicant’s separation from the armed forces or hospitalization, prior to the expiration of any register established as a result of the examination, and prior to the selection for the position.\n\n(4) A disabled veteran may file an application at any time up until a selection has been made for any position for which a register is then maintained as a source for future job openings, or for which a register is about to be established, provided he or she has not already been examined twice for the same position and grade for which application is made, does not have current eligibility on that register, or is not serving in a competitive position in the same grade for which application is made. If a register is not used as a part of the selection process, a disabled veteran may file an application after the closing date, but such application will only be considered if a selection has not been made and the selection process is still active.\n\n(5) An appointing authority may refuse to accept an application from an otherwise qualified preference eligible applicant who is deemed unqualified through his or her actions. Examples of such actions include dismissal for cause from a public entity, a felony conviction, or conduct unbecoming a public employee. Such refusal must be supported by good cause and is appealable pursuant to section 65-506, Idaho Code.\n\n[65-503A, added 2011, ch. 284, sec. 3, p. 775; am. 2013, ch. 187, sec. 17, p. 464.]",

Alternatively, ten (10) points shall be added to the earned rating of the widow or widower of any disabled veteran as long as he or she remains unmarried or the spouse of any eligible disabled veteran who cannot qualify for any public employment because of a service-connected disability.

(1) Applicants who believe they have been denied a right or benefit under this chapter may file an appeal with the governing body of the jurisdiction or unit of government within thirty-five (35) days of the alleged denial of preference. If an applicant has notified the public employer of the applicant’s eligibility for preference pursuant to section 65-503A, Idaho Code, the public employer shall provide notice of the appeal process at the conclusion of the selection process. If the public employer does not initiate the appeal process within thirty-five (35) days of a written request by the applicant, the applicant may file an appeal directly in district court pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The thirty-five (35) day period for appeal shall commence upon the issuance of notice of the appeal process by the public employer. If the public employer fails to issue such notice, the thirty-five (35) day period for appeal shall commence when the applicant becomes aware that he was not selected for the position.\n\n(2) The division of human resources is authorized and directed to issue rules for the enforcement of this chapter. Such rules shall include, but are not limited to, procedures public employers may implement for an internal process that must be exhausted prior to gaining access to the courts.\n\n(3) Any public employer who deliberately or willfully refuses or fails to give preference to qualified veterans required by the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to writs of mandate pursuant to sections 7-301 through 7-314, Idaho Code, and if found in violation of any such provisions shall be required to pay the costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in such action, and may further be required to employ or reemploy the veteran, and shall be required to pay as damages such amount as the court may award, but in no event shall the amount of such damages and costs of suit exceed the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or ten percent (10%) of the annual salary of the position, whichever is higher. Such action must be commenced not more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the alleged denial of preference, provided however, applicants for classified state employment remain subject to the procedures set forth in section 67-5316, Idaho Code.
