The legislature of the state of Idaho believes that the primary responsibility for family life and sex education, including moral responsibility, rests upon the home and the church and the schools can only complement and supplement those standards which are established in the family. The decision as to whether or not any program in family life and sex education is to be introduced in the schools is a matter for determination at the local district level by the local school board of duly selected representatives of the people of the community. If such program is adopted, the legislature believes that:\n\n(1) Major emphasis in such a program should be to assist the home in giving them the knowledge and appreciation of the important place the family home holds in the social system of our culture, its place in the family and the responsibility which will be there much later when they establish their own families;\n\n(2) The program should supplement the work in the home and the church in giving youth the scientific, physiological information for understanding sex and its relation to the miracle of life, including knowledge of the power of the sex drive and the necessity of controlling that drive by self-discipline;\n\n(3) The program should focus upon helping youth acquire a background of ideals and standards and attitudes which will be of value to him now and later when he chooses a mate and establishes his own family; and\n\n(4) The program should include instruction relating to available adoption resources and current adoption practices in the United States, as a means of providing for the well-being of a child, and information pertaining to the Idaho safe haven act, chapter 82, title 39, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-1608, added 1970, ch. 119, sec. 1, p. 282; am. 2024, ch. 131, sec. 2, p. 529.]",

(1) It is not the intent of the legislature that instruction regarding human sexuality as defined in section 33-1609, Idaho Code, shall be included or required in Idaho public schools. Prior to any child attending instruction that addresses human sexuality as it is specifically and narrowly defined in section 33-1609, Idaho Code, regardless of whether such instruction is offered by regular or guest instructors, the school district offering such instruction shall notify parents and legal guardians of children who are eligible to attend such instruction no less than two (2) weeks before the date that such instruction will begin. The school district shall provide the parent or legal guardian with a brief description of the content of the instruction in human sexuality and such parent or legal guardian shall have the opportunity to review any materials that will be used in the instruction. The school district shall not permit any child to attend such instruction unless the parent or legal guardian of such child submits a signed and written permission form to the board of trustees within one (1) week of the commencement of the instruction granting the school district permission to allow the child to attend the instruction. For any child whose parents do not provide the written permission form provided for in this section, alternative educational instruction that furthers the completion of any grade level or graduation requirements and does not address human sexuality as specifically and narrowly defined in section 33-1609, Idaho Code, shall be provided to such child.\n\n(2) A parent or legal guardian of a child who was provided any instruction addressing human sexuality as specifically and narrowly defined in section 33-1609, Idaho Code, without the required signed and written permission form shall provide written notice to the board of trustees or its designee that the instruction occurred.

In continuing recognition of the fundamental duty established by the constitution, the legislature finds it in the public interest to define thoroughness and thereby establish the basic assumptions that govern provision of a thorough system of public schools. A thorough system of public schools in Idaho is one in which:\n\n(a) A safe environment conducive to learning is provided;\n\n(b) Educators are empowered to maintain classroom discipline;\n\n(c) The basic values of honesty, self-discipline, unselfishness, respect for authority, and the central importance of work are emphasized;\n\n(d) The skills necessary to communicate effectively are taught;\n\n(e) A basic curriculum necessary to enable students to enter academic or career technical postsecondary educational programs is provided;\n\n(f) Students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for meeting challenging academic achievement standards and succeeding in the workforce and in life;\n\n(g) The students are introduced to current technology;\n\n(h) The importance of students acquiring the skills to enable them to be responsible citizens of their homes, schools, and communities is emphasized;\n\n(i) Students have the right to an uninterrupted education that covers all disciplines, including music, the arts, and physical education if such courses are offered by the local education agency;\n\n(j) During a period of state or local emergency, if a school district or public charter school has to change from in-person instruction at a school facility to virtual instruction or blended or hybrid instruction, then, to the greatest extent possible and where safety requirements can be developed by the school district or public charter school, an in-person instruction option will be made available to students; and\n\n(k) Student progress is monitored and measured in all required courses of instruction.\n\n(3) The state board shall adopt rules, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and section 33-105(3), Idaho Code, to establish a thorough system of public schools with uniformity as required by the constitution, but shall not otherwise impinge upon the authority of the board of trustees of the school districts. Authority to govern the school district, vested in the board of trustees of the school district, not delegated to the state board, is reserved to the board of trustees.

The aspects of a safe environment conducive to learning as provided by section 33-1612, Idaho Code, that pertain to the physical plant used to provide a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools are hereby defined as those necessary to comply with the safety and health requirements set forth in this section.\n\n(2) Inspection. It is the duty of the board of trustees of every school district and the governing body for other schools described in subsection (1) of this section at least once in every school year to require an independent inspection of the school district’s or other entity’s school facilities to determine whether those school facilities comply with codes addressing safety and health standards for facilities, including electrical, plumbing, mechanical, elevator, fire safety, boiler safety, life safety, structural, snow loading, and sanitary codes, adopted by or pursuant to the Idaho uniform school building safety act, chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code, adopted by the state fire marshal, adopted by generally applicable local ordinances, or adopted by rule of the state board of education and applicable to school facilities. The inspection shall be done pursuant to chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code, or by an independent inspector professionally qualified to conduct inspections under the applicable code. The results of the inspection shall be presented to the administrator of the division of occupational and professional licenses and the board of trustees or other governing body for its review and consideration.\n\n(3) Abatement required — Reporting. The board of trustees or other governing body shall require that the unsafe or unhealthy conditions be abated and shall instruct the school district’s or other entity’s personnel to take necessary steps to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The board of trustees or other governing body must issue a report in the same school year in which the inspections are made declaring whether any unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified have not been abated. The state board of education shall, by rule, provide for uniform reporting of unsafe and unhealthy conditions and for uniform reporting of abatement or absence of abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Copies of such reports shall be provided to the administrator of the division of occupational and professional licenses and the board of trustees of the school district.\n\n(4) Costs of and plan of abatement. If the school district or other entity described in subsection (1) of this section can abate all unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified with the funds available to the school district or other entity, it shall do so, and it need not separately account for the costs of abatement nor segregate funds expended for abatement. If the school district or other entity cannot abate all unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified with the funds available to it, the board of trustees or other governing body shall direct that a plan of abatement be prepared. The plan of abatement shall provide a timetable that shall begin no later than the following school year and that shall provide for abatement with all deliberate speed of unsafe and unhealthy conditions identified. The abatement plan shall be submitted to the administrator of the division of occupational and professional licenses. The school district or other entity shall immediately begin to implement its plan of abatement and must separately account for its costs of abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions and separately segregate funds for the abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions as required by subsection (5) of this section.\n\n(5) Special provisions for implementation of plan of abatement.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law concerning expenditure of lottery moneys distributed to the school district or other entity, all lottery moneys provided to the school district or other entity for a school year in which the school district cannot abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified and not legally encumbered to other uses at the time and all lottery moneys for following school years shall be segregated and expended exclusively for abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions identified until all of the unhealthy and unsafe conditions identified are abated, provided, if the school district has obtained a loan from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund, the provisions of section 33-1017, Idaho Code, and the conditions of the loan shall determine the use of the school district’s lottery moneys during the term of the loan.\n\n(b) If the lottery moneys referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection will, in the board of trustees’ or other governing bodies’ estimation, be insufficient to abate the unsafe and unhealthy conditions identified, the plan of abatement shall identify additional sources of funds to complete the abatement of the unsafe and unhealthy conditions. The board of trustees may choose from among the following sources, or from other sources of its own identification, but the plan of abatement must identify sufficient sources of funds for abatement.\n\n(i) If the school district is not levying under chapter 8, title 33, Idaho Code, at the maximum levies allowed by law for levies that may be imposed by a board of trustees without an election, the board of trustees may increase any of those levies as allowed by law for the school year following the school year in which it was unable to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified.\n\n(ii) If the school district is levying under chapter 8, title 33, Idaho Code, at the maximum levies allowed by law for levies that may be imposed by the board of trustees without an election; or, if after increasing those levies to the maximum levies allowed by law for levies that may be imposed by the board of trustees without an election, there will still be insufficient funds to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified, the school district, after giving notice and conducting a hearing, may declare a financial emergency and/or may apply for a loan or, if eligible, an interest grant from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund as provided in section 33-1017, Idaho Code, to obtain funds to abate the unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified.\n\n(iii) Upon the declaration of a financial emergency, the board of trustees shall have the power to impose a reduction in force, to freeze some or all salaries in the school district, and/or to suspend some or all contracts that may be legally suspended upon the declaration of a financial emergency; provided, that when a board of trustees declares a financial emergency, or when a declaration of a financial emergency is imposed by the state treasurer pursuant to section 33-1017, Idaho Code, and there is a reduction in force, some or all salaries are frozen, or some contracts are suspended, the payments to the school district under the foundation program of chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code, and in particular the staff allowances under that chapter, shall not be reduced during the duration of the financial emergency as a result of a reduction in force, frozen salaries, or suspended salaries from what the staff allowance would be without the reduction in force, frozen salaries or suspended contracts.\n\n(c) All costs of abatement for a program implementing plans of abatement under subsection (5) of this section must be separately accounted for and documented with regard to abatement of each unsafe or unhealthy condition identified.
