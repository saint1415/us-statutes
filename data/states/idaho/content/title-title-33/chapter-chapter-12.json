(1) The professional standards commission may conduct investigations on any signed allegation of unethical conduct of any teacher brought by:\n\n(a) An individual with a substantial interest in the matter, except a student in an Idaho public school; or\n\n(b) A local board of trustees.\n\nThe allegation shall state the specific ground or grounds for the allegation of unethical conduct that could lead to a possible revocation, suspension, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuance of a letter of reprimand. Upon receipt of a written and signed allegation of unethical conduct, the chief certification officer, in conjunction with the attorney general and the professional standards commission investigator, shall conduct a review of the allegation using established guidelines to determine whether to remand the issue to the school district to be resolved locally or to open an investigation and forward the case to the professional standards commission. Within fourteen (14) days of the decision to forward the case, the chief certification officer shall notify the complainant and the teacher, in writing, that an investigation will be conducted and the teacher shall be afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegation verbally and in writing prior to the issuance of the complaint. The executive committee of the professional standards commission shall review the circumstances of the forwarded case at one (1) of the two (2) next regularly scheduled meetings, and determine whether probable cause exists to warrant the filing of a complaint and the requesting of a hearing.\n\n(2) Proceedings to revoke or suspend any certificate issued under section 33-1201, Idaho Code, or to issue a letter of reprimand or place reasonable conditions on the certificate shall be commenced by a written complaint against the holder thereof. Such complaint shall be made by the chief certification officer stating the ground or grounds for issuing a letter of reprimand, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or for revocation or suspension and proposing that a letter of reprimand be issued, reasonable conditions be placed on the certificate, or the certificate be revoked or suspended. A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the certificate holder, either by personal service or by certified mail, within thirty (30) days of determination by the executive committee or such other time agreed to by the teacher and the chief certification officer.\n\n(3) Not more than thirty (30) days after the date of service of any complaint, the person complained against may request, in writing, a hearing upon the complaint. Any such request shall be made and addressed to the state superintendent of public instruction; and if no request for hearing is made, the grounds for suspension, revocation, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuing a letter of reprimand stated in the complaint shall be deemed admitted. Upon a request for hearing, the chief certification officer shall give notice, in writing, to the person requesting the hearing, which notice shall state the time and place of the hearing and which shall occur not more than ninety (90) days from the request for hearing or such other time agreed to by the teacher and the chief certification officer. The time of such hearing shall not be less than five (5) days from the date of notice thereof. Any such hearing shall be informal and shall conform with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The hearing will be held within the school district in which any teacher complained of shall teach, or at such other place deemed most convenient for all parties.\n\n(4) Any such hearing shall be conducted by three (3) or more panel members appointed by the chairman of the professional standards commission, a majority of whom shall hold a position of employment the same as the person complained against. One (1) of the panel members shall serve as the panel chair. The panel chair shall be selected by the chairman of the professional standards commission from a list of former members of the professional standards commission who shall be instructed in conducting administrative hearings. No commission member who participated in the probable cause determination process in a given case shall serve on the hearing panel. All hearings shall be held with the object of ascertaining the truth. Any person complained against may appear in person and may be represented by legal counsel, and may produce, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and, if he chooses to do so, may submit for the consideration of the hearing panel a statement, in writing, in lieu of oral testimony, but any such statement shall be under oath and the affiant shall be subject to cross-examination.\n\n(5) The state superintendent of public instruction, as authorized by the state board of education, has the power to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of pertinent papers, books, documents, records, accounts and testimony. The state board or its authorized representative may, if a witness refuses to attend or testify or to produce any papers required by such subpoena, report to the district court in and for the county in which the proceeding is pending, by petition, setting forth that a due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of the witnesses, or the production of the papers, that the witness has been properly summoned, and that the witness has failed and refused to attend or produce the papers required by this subpoena before the board, or its representative, or has refused to answer questions propounded to him in the course of the proceedings, and ask for an order of the court compelling the witness to attend and testify and produce the papers before the board. The court, upon the petition of the board, shall enter an order directing the witness to appear before the court at a time and place to be fixed by the court in the order, the time to be not more than ten (10) days from the date of the order, and then and there shall show cause why he has not attended and testified or produced the papers before the board or its representative. A copy of the order shall be served upon the witness. If it shall appear to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued by the board and regularly served, the court shall thereupon order that the witness appear before the board at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required papers. Upon failure to obey the order, the witness shall be dealt with for contempt of court. The subpoenas shall be served and witness fees and mileage paid as allowed in civil cases in the district courts of this state.\n\n(6) Within twenty-one (21) days of the conclusion of any hearing dealing with the revocation, suspension, denial of a certificate, placing reasonable conditions on the certificate, or issuing a letter of reprimand, the hearing panel shall submit to the chief certification officer, to the person complained against and to the chief administrative officer of the public school employing the certificate holder, if any, a concise statement of the proceedings, a summary of the testimony, and any documentary evidence offered, together with the findings of fact and a decision. The hearing panel may determine to suspend or revoke the certificate, or the panel may order that reasonable conditions be placed on the certificate or a letter of reprimand be sent to the certificate holder, or if there are not sufficient grounds, the allegation against the certificate holder is dismissed and is so recorded.\n\n(7) Within three (3) days of issuance, the hearing panel’s decision shall be made a permanent part of the record of the certificate holder. Should the final decision be to place reasonable conditions upon the certificate holder or a suspension or revocation of the teaching certificate, the professional standards commission must notify the employing public school of the hearing panel’s decision and to provide notice that such may negatively impact upon the employment status of the certificated employee.\n\n(8) The final decision of the hearing panel shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, in the district court of the county in which the holder of a revoked certificate has been last employed as a teacher.\n\n(9) Whenever any certificate has been revoked, suspended or has had reasonable conditions placed upon it, or an application has been denied, the professional standards commission may, upon a clear showing that the cause constituting grounds for the listed actions no longer exists, issue a valid certificate. Provided however, that no certificate shall be issued to any person who has been convicted of any crime listed in subsection (2) of section 33-1208, Idaho Code.\n\n(10) For any person certified in another state and applying for certification in Idaho, and for any person previously certified in this state who is applying for certification in the event their certification has lapsed or is seeking renewal of a current certification, the chief certification officer shall deny an application for a new certificate or for a renewal of a certificate, regardless of the jurisdiction where such certificate was issued, if there are any unsatisfied conditions on such current or previously issued certificate or if there is any form of pending investigation by a state agency concerning the applicant’s teaching license or certificate. Provided however, the chief certification officer shall not automatically deny the application if such person authorized in writing that the chief certification officer and the professional standards commission shall have full access to the investigative files concerning the conditions on, or investigation concerning, such certificate in Idaho or any other state or province. Upon review of the information authorized for release by the applicant, the chief certification officer shall either grant or deny such application or, upon denial and upon written request made by the applicant within thirty (30) days of such denial, shall afford the applicant with the procedures set forth in subsections (3) through (9) of this section. If the applicant does not execute the written authorization discussed herein, reapplication may be made once all investigations have been completed and all conditions have been satisfied, resulting in a clear certificate from the issuing state or province.\n\n(11) For the purposes of this section, the term \"teacher\" shall include any individual required to hold a certificate pursuant to section 33-1201, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-1209, added 1989, ch. 122, sec. 2, p. 269; am. 1992, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 514; am. 1993, ch. 216, sec. 16, p. 597; am. 1995, ch. 235, sec. 1, p. 794; am. 2004, ch. 221, sec. 1, p. 659; am. 2011, ch. 246, sec. 2, p. 664; am. 2012, ch. 210, sec. 1, p. 565; am. 2020, ch. 264, sec. 3, p. 768.]",

(1) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Applicant\" means an applicant for employment in a certificated or noncertificated position who is currently or was previously employed by a school district.\n\n(b) \"Employer\" means a school district employer.\n\n(2) Before hiring an applicant, a school district shall request the applicant to sign a statement:\n\n(a) Authorizing the applicant’s current and past employers, including employers outside of the state of Idaho, to release to the hiring school district all information relating to the job performance and/or job related conduct, if any, of the applicant and making available to the hiring school district copies of all documents in the previous employer’s personnel files established pursuant to sections 33-517 or 33-518, Idaho Code, or investigative or other files, regardless of whether or not the employee has received notice of the existence of such documentation due to a voluntary separation from employment or the employee’s refusal to sign such documents, relating to the job performance by the applicant. Upon separation of employment, all documents from any other file, including an investigative file, shall be moved into the personnel file. The requirement to submit investigative files to the personnel file shall not be construed to be a waiver of the attorney client privilege. Names of any student, fellow employee or complainant, other than the employee’s administrative supervisor or administrative author shall be redacted from investigative file documents prior to placement in the personnel file. The former employee shall be provided a copy of the documents and written notice of the inclusion of the information in the personnel file to the former employee’s last known address. The former employee shall be permitted the opportunity to file a rebuttal to the new documents placed into the personnel file. If an ongoing personnel investigation was taking place, the contents of the district’s investigative file shall be forwarded to the professional standards commission when the district submits the report required pursuant to section 33-1208A, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Documentation related to the job performance or job related conduct of any employee/applicant is defined as and may be limited by the producing district to include: all annual evaluations, letters of reprimand, letters of direction, letters of commendation or award, disciplinary actions and documentation of disciplinary investigations, recommendations for probation, notices of probation, notices of removal from probation, recommendations for termination or nonrenewal, notices of termination or nonrenewal, notices from the professional standards commission of Idaho or any other such similar state agency of action taken against an individual’s certificate and any rebuttal documentation filed by the employee relative to any of the above documents. Names of any student or fellow employee complainant, other than the employee’s administrative evaluator or administrative author of communication to the employee, shall be redacted from such provided documentation.\n\n(c) Releasing the applicant’s current and past employers, and employees acting on behalf of that employer, from any liability for providing information described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\n\n(3) Before hiring an applicant, a school district shall request in writing, electronic or otherwise, the applicant’s current and past public school employers, including out-of-state employers, to provide the information described in subsection (2)(a) of this section, if any. The request shall include a copy of the statement signed by the applicant under subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(4) Not later than twenty (20) business days after receiving a request under subsection (3) of this section, a school district within Idaho shall provide the information requested and make available to the requesting school district copies of all documents in the applicant’s personnel record relating to job performance. The school district, or an employee acting on behalf of the school district, who in good faith discloses information under this section either in writing, printed material, electronic material or orally is immune from civil liability for the disclosure. An employer is presumed to be acting in good faith at the time of the disclosure under this section unless the evidence establishes one (1) or more of the following: (a) that the employer knew the information disclosed was false or misleading; (b) that the employer disclosed the information with reckless disregard for the truth; or (c) that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by a state or federal statute.\n\n(5) A hiring district shall request from the office of the superintendent of public instruction verification of certification status, any past or pending violations of the professional code of ethics, any detail as to any prior or pending conditions placed upon a certificate holder’s certificate, any prior or pending revocation, suspension or the existence of any prior letters of reprimand and information relating to job performance as established by the provisions of subsection (11) of this section, if any, for applicants for certificated employment.\n\n(6) A school district shall not hire an applicant who does not sign the statement described in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(7) School districts may employ applicants on a noncontracted provisional basis pursuant to the provisions of this section. Once the prior employer personnel performance materials have arrived for an individual provisionally hired, the district must review the documents within thirty (30) days of receipt. A standard certificated contract shall automatically be issued at the end of the thirty (30) day review period unless, prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the board articulates in writing the specific information received pursuant to subsection (2)(a) of this section, which justifies the decision not to issue a standard contract. The reason articulated in this decision must derive only from the documents received in the personnel file and cannot be based upon any event that has occurred during the status as a noncontracted provisional certified professional employee. Prior to issuing a standard certificated contract or prior to the decision not to issue a standard certificated contract, or upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, an individual employed as a noncontracted provisional certificated professional employee shall be provided with the same compensation and benefits as if the employee had been employed on a standard certificated contract. When requests are sent to out-of-state employers under subsection (3) of this section, an applicant who has signed the statement described in subsection (2) of this section shall not be prevented from gaining employment in Idaho public schools if the laws or policies of that other state prevent documents from being made available to Idaho school districts or if the out-of-state school district fails or refuses to cooperate with the request.\n\n(a) If no documentation is going to be forthcoming from an out-of-state employer, the Idaho district may initially employ the applicant on a standard contract and not utilize the conditional basis employment.\n\n(b) For new employees with no prior public school work experience or for applicants whose out-of-state former employers will not release documentation pursuant to this statute, the district board shall develop a policy to confirm prior work experience and check references.\n\n(8) Information received pursuant to this section shall be used by a school district only for the purpose of evaluating an applicant’s qualifications for employment in the position for which he or she has applied. Except as otherwise provided by law, a board member or employee of a school district shall not disclose the information to any person, other than the applicant, who is not directly involved in the process of evaluating the applicant’s qualifications for employment. A person who violates the provisions of this subsection may be civilly liable for damages caused by such violation.\n\n(9) Beginning September 1, 2011, the board or an official of a school district shall not enter into any resignation agreement, severance agreement, or any other contract or agreement that has the effect of suppressing information about negative job performance by a present or former employee or of expunging information about that performance or unethical conduct from any documents in the previous employer’s personnel, investigative or other files relating to job performance by the applicant. Any provision of a contract or agreement that is contrary to this subsection is void and unenforceable. This subsection does not restrict the expungement from a personnel file of information about alleged verbal or physical abuse or sexual misconduct that has not been substantiated.\n\n(10) This section does not prevent a school district from requesting or requiring an applicant to provide information other than that described in this section.\n\n(11) By September 1, 2012, the state board of education has the authority to and shall adopt rules defining job standards performance and \"verbal abuse,\" \"physical abuse,\" \"sexual misconduct\" and \"unethical conduct\" as defined in the code of ethics for Idaho professional educators for application to all certificated and noncertificated employees. The definitions of job standards performance, verbal and physical abuse and sexual misconduct adopted by the state board of education must include the requirement that the school district has made a determination that there is sufficient information to conclude that the abuse or unethical conduct occurred and that the abuse or unethical conduct resulted in the employee’s leaving his or her position at the school district.\n\n[33-1210, added 2011, ch. 246, sec. 3, p. 666; am. 2012, ch. 210, sec. 2, p. 568.]",

The focus of college and career planning is to help students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve academic success and to be college and career ready upon high school graduation.\n\n(2) School districts and charter schools may employ noncertificated staff to serve in the role of college and career advisors and student mentors. Appropriate alternative forms of advising and mentoring shall be research-based and may include the following:\n\n(a) High contact programs such as:\n\n(i) Near peer or college student mentors; and\n\n(ii) Counselor, teacher or paraprofessional as advisor or mentor;\n\n(b) Collaborative programs such as:\n\n(i) Student ambassadors; and\n\n(ii) Cooperative agreements with other school districts or postsecondary institutions; and\n\n(c) Virtual coach or mentor programs.\n\n(3) School districts and charter schools shall provide professional development in the area of college and career advising to all staff serving in the role of student mentors or advisors.

(a) At the beginning of each new employment year and thereafter as necessary during the employment year, each noncertificated employee of any school district, including charter districts, who regularly works twenty (20) hours or more per week or certificated employee who works half time or more per week for a school district, including charter districts, shall be entitled to sick leave with full pay of one (1) day, as projected for the employment year for each month of service in which they work a majority portion of that month, subject to the limitations provided by this chapter. Sick leave for noncertificated employees shall be calculated proportionate to the average hours worked per day. Sick leave for certificated employees shall be calculated by the day, or percentage thereof, as defined in their individual employment contracts. The local board of trustees shall not provide compensation for unused sick leave. This shall not prohibit the local board of trustees from establishing a policy providing retirement severance pay.\n\n(b) The board of trustees may require proof of illness adequate to protect the district against malingering and false claims of illness. Any accumulated sick leave earned prior to July 1, 1976, shall be used before the use of any accumulated sick leave earned subsequent to July 1, 1976.\n\nEach local board of trustees may establish a policy governing leave for certificated and noncertificated employees in the case of illness or death of members of the families of such employees, for professional conferences and workshops, and for such other purposes as the board may determine.\n\n(c) Each local board of trustees may establish a policy governing leave for certificated and noncertificated employees in the case of absence during a period for which the employee is paid by worker’s compensation. In addition the board may supplement the worker’s compensation payment by an amount not to exceed an amount which when combined with the worker’s compensation payment would be equal to the amount the employee would have been paid if he had not been injured.

This term does not include devices implemented by trained school personnel or utilized by a student that have been prescribed by an appropriate medical-related services professional and are used for the specific and approved purposes for which such devices were designed, such as:\n\n1. Adaptive devices or mechanical supports, when used to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment to allow greater freedom of mobility than would be possible without the use of such devices or mechanical supports;\n\n2. Vehicle safety restraints, when used as intended during the transport of a student in a moving vehicle;\n\n3. Restraints for medical immobilization; or\n\n4. Orthopedically prescribed devices that permit a student to participate in activities without risk of harm; and\n\n(iii) \"Chemical restraint\" means the use of drugs or medication to control behavior.

It is the duty of a teacher to carry out the rules and regulations of the board of trustees in managing classroom behavior, and a teacher shall have the power to adopt any reasonable rule or regulation to manage classroom behavior and otherwise govern the classroom, not inconsistent with any statute or rule or regulation of the board of trustees. However, corporal punishment shall not be used.\n\n(3) Restraint and seclusion shall not be used as forms of discipline or methods of classroom governance.

Chemical restraint shall not be used for any purpose. Physical or mechanical restraint or seclusion may be deployed only in circumstances where a pupil’s conduct has placed himself, employees, or any other individual in imminent danger of serious bodily harm. Termination of restraint or seclusion shall immediately occur when it is determined that the student is no longer placing himself, employees, or any other individual in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or when a parent or legal guardian has taken custody of the student.\n\n(4) The state department of education shall prepare resources, guidance, and training modules to support schools in adhering to the provisions of this section.\n\n(5) All public and charter school staff directly assigned to students or classrooms shall receive annual professional development training regarding positive behavior supports, de-escalation techniques, and classroom behavior management.

A sum equal to one-half (1/2) of the monetary value of such unused sick leave, calculated at the rate of pay for such employee during the employee’s highest year of salary used in the average monthly salary, as determined by the retirement board, shall be transferred from the sick leave account provided by subsection (3) of this section and shall be credited to such employee’s retirement account. Such sums shall be used by the retirement board to continue to pay, subject to applicable federal tax limits:\n\n(a) Premiums for the retiree and the retiree’s dependents at the rate for the active employee’s group health, long-term care, vision, prescription drug and dental insurance programs as maintained by the employer for the active employees until the retiree and/or the retiree’s spouse becomes eligible for medicare at which time the district shall make available a supplemental program to medicare for the eligible individual.

Coverage may be continued for the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse and dependents until remarriage of the spouse or until the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse is eligible for a group health program by an employer. The medicare supplement program will provide the same premium and benefits for all retirees of all the employers served by the same insurance carrier. However, a school district may make available to all retirees from that district other benefits in addition to the medicare supplement program, and the retiree or the district shall pay for such additional benefits.\n\n(b) Premiums at the time of retirement for the retiree for the life insurance program maintained by the employer which may be reduced to a minimum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) of coverage.\n\n(2) The retiree may continue to pay the premiums for the health, accident, dental and life insurance to the extent of the funds credited to the employee’s account pursuant to this section, and when these funds are expended, the premiums may be deducted from the retiree’s allowance. Upon a retiree’s death, any unexpended sums remaining in the retiree’s account shall revert to the sick leave account. If funds are not available for payment by the Idaho public employee retirement system from the retiree’s surviving dependent spouse’s allowance, the insurance carrier shall implement a direct billing procedure to permit the retiree’s surviving spouse to continue coverage.\n\n(3) Each employer shall contribute to a sick leave account maintained by the public employee retirement system in trust exclusively for the purpose of the provisions of this section. The retirement board shall serve as trustee of the trust and shall be indemnified to the same extent as provided in section 59-1305, Idaho Code. Assets in the trust shall not be assignable or subject to execution, garnishment or attachment or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law. The rate of such contribution each pay period shall consist of a percentage of employees’ salaries as determined by the board, and such rate shall remain in effect until next determined by the board. Any excess balance in the sick leave account shall be invested, and the earnings therefrom shall accrue to the sick leave account except the amount required by the board to defray administrative expenses. Assets of the trust may be commingled for investment purposes with other assets managed by the retirement board. All moneys payable to the sick leave account are hereby perpetually appropriated to the board and shall not be included in its departmental budget.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section public school employment shall be defined to include the employees of the Idaho digital learning academy, and to permit inclusion of employees of organizations funded by school districts or of contributions of employees of school districts and shall include employees of the Idaho bureau of educational services for the deaf and the blind.\n\n[33-1228, added 1978, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 347; am. 1982, ch. 206, sec. 1, p. 569; am. 1988, ch. 254, sec. 1, p. 493; am. 1990, ch. 407, sec. 1, p. 1133; am. 1993, ch. 398, sec. 1, p. 1461; am. 2006, ch. 150, sec. 1, p. 463; am. 2007, ch. 78, sec. 1, p. 205; am. 2009, ch. 55, sec. 1, p. 156; am. 2009, ch. 168, sec. 3, p. 503; am. 2018, ch. 91, sec. 1, p. 195.]",
