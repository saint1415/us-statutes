This term may also apply to virtual, blended, or other career technical education programs.\n\n(3) The courses, programs, training, and services include, but are not limited to, career, technical, and applied technology education. They are delivered through the career technical delivery system of public secondary schools, including approved public charter schools, irrespective of the delivery method, and postsecondary schools and colleges. The division of career technical education will include approved public charter schools and their students equally and without discrimination in reviewing, authorizing, and funding the delivery of career technical education courses and programs, irrespective of the school’s chosen instructional delivery method, as long as the chosen instructional delivery method is appropriate to the nature of the work as demonstrated by participation in a capstone course that meets recognized industry standards. Career technical education programs may be delivered by traditional, blended, or virtual models and must meet the required elements as outlined in the state standards for secondary programs. Virtual programs will utilize post-capstone interviews conducted by industry professionals to demonstrate technical proficiency and to satisfy face-to-face requirements. Interviews will be based on students’ needs and may be conducted face-to-face or electronically.\n\n[(33-2202) 1919, ch. 53, part of sec. 2, p. 160; C.S., sec. 1003; I.C.A., sec. 32-1702; am. 1963, ch. 150, sec. 1, p. 451; am. 1970, ch. 4, sec. 1, p. 6; am. 1999, ch. 329, sec. 5, p. 856; am. 2016, ch. 25, sec. 11, p. 43; am. 2018, ch. 95, sec. 1, p. 203; am. 2019, ch. 298, sec. 2, p. 882.]",
