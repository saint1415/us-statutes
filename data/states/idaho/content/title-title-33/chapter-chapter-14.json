      "text": "33-1402. ENROLLMENT OPTIONS. (1) Each school district shall implement an enrollment options program as provided in this section. School districts shall adopt policies to govern the process for enrollment options pursuant to this chapter, including in-district transfers. The policies shall prohibit discrimination against any pupil on the basis of his residential address, ability, disability, race, ethnicity, sex, or socioeconomic status. Such policies shall be posted to the school district’s website. Schools of choice within a district that have lottery enrollment policies are not subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) Whenever the parent or legal guardian of any Idaho pupil determines that it is in the best interest of the pupil to attend a school within another district, or to attend another school within the home district, such pupil may be transferred to and attend the selected school, subject to the provisions of this section and section 33-1404, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) The pupil’s parent or legal guardian shall apply for admission to a school within another district, or to another school within the home district, on a form provided by the state department of education or a district-provided form that is substantially similar. The application shall be submitted to the receiving school district by February 1 for enrollment during the following school year, and notice of such application shall be given to the home district. At the time of application, the parent or legal guardian shall request that the home district or school forward the pupil’s student record. The home district or school shall respond by forwarding a certified copy of the transferred student’s record within ten (10) days, unless the provisions of section 18-4511, Idaho Code, apply. The receiving school district, or the receiving school within the home district, shall notify the applicant within sixty (60) days and, if denied, shall include written explanation of the denial.\n\n(4) There may be times during the school year when a parent or legal guardian believes it is in the best interest of the pupil to transfer schools. Open enrollment applications shall be accepted at any time throughout the year. However, those applications received after the February 1 deadline will be considered based on capacity stated in policy at the receiving district.\n\n(5) Priority for enrollment under this section shall be given to pupils applying to attend another school within the home district.\n\n(6) A district may deny a transfer application for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The pupil was expelled by the pupil’s previous district;\n\n(b) The pupil has a documented history of significant disciplinary issues;\n\n(c) The pupil has a conviction or adjudication for any of the offenses under section 20-525A(5), Idaho Code, or chapter 9, 61, or 66, title 18, Idaho Code;\n\n(d) The pupil has a documented history of chronic absenteeism; or\n\n(e) The receiving district does not have space available pursuant to section 33-1409, Idaho Code. Where applicable, a denial may include information about other schools that are below maximum enrollment.\n\n(7) For a pupil accepted by the receiving school or district, the parent or legal guardian does not need to reapply to regain acceptance the next school year. However, the parent or legal guardian shall provide notice to the receiving school or district of intent for the pupil to reenroll. The district may prescribe the form of notice. Once a pupil has been enrolled at the same school for a second consecutive year, the pupil may complete his education at such school, unless the pupil’s approved transfer has been revoked pursuant to this section.\n\n(8) Whenever any pupil enrolls in and attends a school outside the district within which the parent or legal guardian resides, the parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for transporting the pupil to and from the school or to an appropriate bus stop within the receiving district. For students attending another school within the home district, the parent or legal guardian is responsible for transporting the pupil to and from an appropriate bus stop. Tuition shall be waived for parents or legal guardians of any Idaho pupils allowed under the provisions of this section. Tuition charged to the debtor district may be waived by the creditor district.\n\n(9) A pupil who applies and is accepted in a nonresident school district is subject to the policy of the receiving school district and shall be ineligible to again apply for an enrollment option or the transfer approval may be revoked in that nonresident district if:\n\n(a) The pupil is chronically absent;\n\n(b) The pupil commits repeated, serious disciplinary infractions;\n\n(c) The pupil commits disciplinary infractions that result in expulsion;\n\n(d) The pupil has a conviction or adjudication for any of the offenses under section 20-525A(5), Idaho Code, or chapter 9, 61, or 66, title 18, Idaho Code; or\n\n(e) The school in which the student is enrolled exceeds maximum enrollment of resident pupils due to growth. However, pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, the receiving district may not revoke a transfer approval to a school after two (2) consecutive years of attendance. If a transfer approval is revoked under this subsection, the receiving district shall offer the pupil information about other schools within the district that are below maximum enrollment.\n\n(10) A receiving school shall inform the parent or legal guardian of the circumstances that jeopardize the student’s status at a transfer school.\n\n(11) No district shall take any action to prohibit or prevent application by resident pupils to attend school in another school district or to attend another school within the home district.\n\n[33-1402, added 1990, ch. 43, sec. 2, p. 68; am. 1993, ch. 76, sec. 1, p. 202; am. 2023, ch. 156, sec. 1, p. 420; am. 2024, ch. 16, sec. 10, p. 143; am. 2025, ch. 220, sec. 2, p. 1038.]",

(1) The state department of education shall prepare and distribute all necessary forms and shall issue to each school district, annually, a tuition certificate bearing a serial number, which certificate shall authorize the receiving district to charge and to bill for the tuition of its nonresident pupils where tuition has not been waived.\n\n(2) In determining tuition rates to be charged by any creditor school district, the state department of education shall compute the sum of that district’s maintenance and operation costs, depreciation on its buildings, equipment, and other property, and the interest, if any paid by it on bonded debt or registered warrants. The said state department of education shall then compute what proportion of the sum of said costs, depreciation, and interest is allocable to elementary schools and what proportion is allocable to secondary schools in the district. The proportion allocable to elementary schools shall then be divided by the average daily attendance of elementary school pupils, and the proportion allocable to secondary schools shall be divided by the average daily attendance of secondary school pupils, in the district, and the amount so determined shall be the gross per-pupil cost, elementary or secondary, as the case may be.
