      "text": "33-1302. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature hereby finds that interpreting services in Idaho public schools, kindergarten through grade twelve (12), for students who are deaf, hard of hearing or deaf-blind need to be improved. The absence of state standards for evaluating educational interpreters allows for inconsistencies in the delivery of educational information to students who are in need of such services. The legislature recognizes that educational interpreters in Idaho public schools must not only interpret the spoken word but must also convey concepts and facilitate the student’s understanding of the educational material. The legislature also finds that among the many factors that influence student success, there is a correlation between the academic achievements of deaf, hard of hearing and deaf-blind students and the competency of their interpreters. Therefore, the legislature finds that Idaho educational public policy is served by establishing standards for persons employed in the Idaho public schools as educational interpreters.\n\n[33-1302, added 2006, ch. 173, sec. 1, p. 531.]",
