(1) The parent or guardian of a child of school age who is enrolled in a nonpublic school or a public charter school shall be allowed to enroll the student in any public school, including another public charter school, for dual enrollment purposes. The board of trustees of the school district or board of directors of the public charter school shall adopt procedures governing enrollment pursuant to this section. If enrollment in a specific program reaches the maximum for the program, priority for enrollment shall be given to a student who is enrolled full time in the public school. In the case of dual enrollment in a public charter school, the student who is dually enrolled shall not count toward the public charter school’s maximum enrollment restrictions. The dually enrolled student’s primary education provider shall be the provider in which the student is registered for the majority of the coursework. At no time may the dual enrollment provisions be used to circumvent a public charter school’s lottery requirements.\n\n(2) Any student participating in dual enrollment may enter into any program in the public school available to other students, subject to compliance with the eligibility requirements herein and the same responsibilities and standards of behavior and performance that apply to any student’s participation in the activity, except that the academic eligibility requirements for participation in nonacademic activities are as provided for herein.\n\n(3) All schools shall be allowed to include dually enrolled nonpublic school and public school students for the purposes of state funding only to the extent of the student’s participation in the public school programs.\n\n(4) Oversight of academic standards relating to participation in nonacademic public school activities shall be the responsibility of the primary education provider for that student. In order for any nonpublic school student or public school student to participate in nonacademic public school activities for which public school students must demonstrate academic proficiency or eligibility, the nonpublic school or public school student shall demonstrate composite grade-level academic proficiency on any state board of education recognized achievement test, portfolio, or other mechanism as provided for in state board of education rules. Additionally, a student shall be eligible if he achieves a minimum composite, core or survey test score within the average or higher-than-average range as established by the test service utilized on any nationally normed test. Demonstrated proficiency shall be used to determine eligibility for the current and next following school years. School districts and public charter schools shall provide to nonpublic students who wish to participate in dual enrollment activities the opportunity to take state tests or other standardized tests given to all regularly enrolled public school students.\n\n(5) A public school student who has been unable to maintain academic eligibility is ineligible to participate in nonacademic public school activities as a nonpublic school or public charter school student for the duration of the school year in which the student becomes academically ineligible and for the following academic year.\n\n(6) A nonpublic school or public school student participating in nonacademic public school activities must reside within the attendance boundaries of the school for which the student participates.\n\n(7) Dual enrollment shall include the option of joint enrollment in a regular public school and an alternative public school program. The state board of education shall establish rules that provide funding to school districts for each student who participates in both a regular public school program and an alternative public school program.\n\n(8) Dual enrollment shall include the option of enrollment in a postsecondary institution. Any credits earned from an accredited postsecondary institution shall be credited toward state board of education high school graduation requirements.\n\n(9) A nonpublic student is any student who receives educational instruction outside a public school classroom and such instruction can include, but is not limited to, a private school or a home school.\n\n[33-203, added 1995, ch. 224, sec. 1, p. 775; am. 1999, ch. 387, sec. 1, p. 1082; am. 2002, ch. 106, sec. 1, p. 289; am. 2017, ch. 62, sec. 1, p. 151.]",

(1) The board of trustees may deny enrollment or attendance at any of its schools by expulsion, to any pupil:\n\n(a) Who is habitually truant;\n\n(b) Whose conduct, in the judgment of the board, is such as to be continuously disruptive of school discipline or of the instructional effectiveness of the school;\n\n(c) Whose presence in a public school is detrimental to the health and safety of other pupils;\n\n(d) Who has possessed a deadly or dangerous weapon or firearm on school property;\n\n(e) Who has been denied enrollment due to behavior detrimental to the health and safety of other pupils, disenrolled in lieu of discipline, or expelled from another school in this state or any other state; or\n\n(f) Who has a conviction or adjudication for any of the offenses under section 20-525A(5), Idaho Code, or chapter 9, 61, or 66, title 18, Idaho Code. Such convictions or adjudications shall be disclosed by a parent or legal guardian of a pupil to any school district where the pupil is seeking enrollment or is enrolled. The parent’s or legal guardian’s failure to disclose such convictions shall constitute adequate grounds to deny enrollment or attendance to such pupil.\n\n(2) Discipline of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with the requirements of federal law part B of the individuals with disabilities education act and section 504 of the rehabilitation act.\n\n(3) Any pupil having been denied enrollment or expelled may be enrolled or readmitted to the school by the board of trustees upon such reasonable conditions as may be prescribed by the board; but such enrollment or readmission shall not prevent the board from again expelling such pupil for cause.\n\n(4) Provided however, the board shall expel from school for a period of no less than one (1) year, twelve (12) calendar months, or may deny enrollment to a student who has been found to have possessed a firearm on school property in this state or any other state. The board may modify such expulsion or denial of enrollment requirement on a case-by-case basis when the board determines reasonable conditions apply and the student’s presence is not detrimental to the health and safety of other students. An authorized representative of the board shall report such student and incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency.\n\n(5) No pupil shall be expelled or denied enrollment without the board of trustees having first given written notice to the parent or legal guardian of the pupil, which notice shall state the grounds for the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment and the time and place where such parent or legal guardian may appear to contest the action of the board to deny school attendance and which notice shall state the rights of the pupil to be represented by counsel, to produce witnesses and submit evidence on his own behalf, and to cross-examine any adult witnesses who may appear against him. Within a reasonable period of time following such notification, the board of trustees shall grant the pupil and his parents or legal guardian a full and fair hearing on the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment. However, the board shall allow a reasonable period of time between such notification and the holding of such hearing to allow the pupil and his parents or legal guardian to prepare their response to the charge. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 74-205 and 74-206, Idaho Code, a decision to expel or to deny enrollment of a student may be made in executive session, and the student shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the student’s educational record and in the official records of the board. Any pupil within the age of compulsory attendance who is expelled or denied enrollment as herein provided shall come under the purview of the juvenile corrections act, and an authorized representative of the board shall, within five (5) days, give written notice of the pupil’s expulsion to the prosecuting attorney of the county of the pupil’s residence.\n\n(6) The superintendent of any district or the principal of any school may temporarily suspend any pupil for disciplinary reasons, including student harassment, intimidation or bullying, or for other conduct disruptive of good order or of the instructional effectiveness of the school. A temporary suspension by the principal shall not exceed five (5) school days, and the school superintendent may extend the temporary suspension an additional ten (10) school days. Provided, that on a finding by the board of trustees, which finding shall be made in executive session, that immediate return to school attendance by the temporarily suspended student would be detrimental to other pupils’ health, welfare, or safety, the board of trustees may extend the temporary suspension for an additional five (5) school days. Prior to suspending any student, the superintendent or principal shall grant an informal hearing on the reasons for the suspension and the opportunity to challenge those reasons. Any pupil who has been suspended may be readmitted to the school by the superintendent or principal who suspended him upon such reasonable conditions as said superintendent or principal may prescribe. The board of trustees shall be notified of any temporary suspensions, the reasons therefor, and the response, if any, thereto.\n\n(7) The board of trustees of each school district shall establish the procedure to be followed by the superintendent and principals under its jurisdiction for the purpose of effecting a temporary suspension, which procedure shall conform to the minimal requirements of due process and afford the pupil privacy.\n\n(8) As used in this section, \"possess,\" \"deadly or dangerous weapon,\" and \"firearm\" have the same meanings as provided in section 18-3302D, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-205, added 1963, ch. 13, sec. 28, p. 27; am. 1973, ch. 294, sec. 1, p. 618; am. 1976, ch. 86, sec. 1, p. 293; am. 1978, ch. 67, sec. 1, p. 135; am. 1992, ch. 47, sec. 1, p. 149; am. 1995, ch. 248, sec. 2, p. 820; am. 1995, ch. 250, sec. 1, p. 825; am. 1995, ch. 252, sec. 1, p. 827; am. 1998, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 680; am. 2002, ch. 348, sec. 1, p. 994; am. 2006, ch. 313, sec. 1, p. 969; am. 2021, ch. 182, sec. 1, p. 502; am. 2021, ch. 290, sec. 1, p. 869; am. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 21, p. 381; am. 2025, ch. 220, sec. 1, p. 1036.]",

      "text": "33-210. STUDENTS USING OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL OR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. (1) It is legislative intent that parental involvement in all aspects of a child’s education in the public school system remain a priority. Substance abuse prevention programs and counseling for students attending public schools are no exception. Consequently, it is the duty of the board of trustees of each school district, including specially chartered school districts, and governing boards of charter schools, to adopt and implement policies specifying how personnel shall respond when a student discloses or is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance defined by section 37-2732C, Idaho Code. Such policies shall include provisions that anonymity will be provided to the student on a faculty \"need to know\" basis, when a student voluntarily discloses using or being under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance while on school property or at a school function, except as deemed reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety of others. Notification of the disclosure and availability of counseling for students shall be provided to parents, the legal guardian or child’s custodian. However, once a student is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code, regardless of any previous voluntary disclosure, the school administrator or designee shall contact the student’s parent, legal guardian or custodian, and report the incident to law enforcement. The fact that a student has previously disclosed use of alcohol or a controlled substance shall not be deemed a factor in determining reasonable suspicion at a later date.\n\n(2) In addition to policies adopted pursuant to this section, students may, at the discretion of the district board of trustees or governing board of a charter school, be subject to other disciplinary or safety policies, regardless whether the student voluntarily discloses or is reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of district or charter school policy or section 37-2732C, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) The district board of trustees or the governing board of the charter school shall ensure that procedures are developed for contacting law enforcement and the student’s parents, legal guardian or custodian regarding a student reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. District and charter school policies formulated to meet the provisions of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code, and this section shall be made available to each student, parent, guardian or custodian by August 31, 2002, and thereafter as provided by section 33-512(6), Idaho Code.\n\n(4) Any school district employee or independent contractor of an educational institution who has a reasonable suspicion that a student is using or is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and, acting upon that suspicion, reports that suspicion to a school administrator or initiates procedures adopted by the board of trustees or governing board of the charter school pursuant to this section, shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed. Any such participant shall have the same immunity with respect to participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from such report. Any person who reports in bad faith or with malice shall not be protected by this section. Employees and independent contractors of educational institutions who intentionally harass a student through the misuse of the authority provided in this section shall not be immune from civil liability arising from the wrongful exercise of that authority and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300).\n\n(5) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(a) \"Reasonable suspicion\" means an act of judgment by a school employee or independent contractor of an educational institution which leads to a reasonable and prudent belief that a student is in violation of school board or charter school governing board policy regarding alcohol or controlled substance use, or the \"use\" or \"under the influence\" provisions of section 37-2732C, Idaho Code. Said judgment shall be based on training in recognizing the signs and symptoms of alcohol and controlled substance use.\n\n(b) \"Intentionally harass\" means a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific student which seriously alarms, annoys, threatens or intimidates the student and which serves no legitimate purpose. The course of conduct must be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.\n\n(c) \"Course of conduct\" means a pattern or series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Constitutionally and statutorily protected activity is not included within the meaning of \"course of conduct.\"\n\n[33-210, added 1996, ch. 379, sec. 1, p. 1284; am. 1998, ch. 206, sec. 1, p. 732; am. 2002, ch. 353, sec. 1, p. 1007; am. 2006, ch. 244, sec. 2, p. 740.]",
