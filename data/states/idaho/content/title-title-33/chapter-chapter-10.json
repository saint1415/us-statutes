In applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance, but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of education following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expenditures.\n\n(5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per support unit.\n\n(6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school district in the state shall be determined as follows:\n\n(a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding students approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational program for the administrative schools and each of the separate schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients to obtain the district’s support units allowance for regular students, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth.\n\n(ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile detention center students and students with disabilities approved for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of exceptional education support units to obtain the number of support units allowed for the district’s approved exceptional child program. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.\n\n(iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be the sum of the total support units for regular students, subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph.\n\n(b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the district’s total number of support units, carried out to the nearest hundredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in subsection (2) of this section to secure the district’s total allowance for the educational support program.\n\n(c) District Share. The district’s share of state apportionment is the amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncertificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district’s share as calculated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.\n\n(7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school maintenance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calculating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%).

(1) School districts, public charter schools, and eligible cooperative service agencies may establish career technical centers that qualify for funding appropriated for the specific purpose of supporting the added cost of career technical centers. These funds will be appropriated to the state board for career technical education, to be expended by the division of career technical education. In order for a center to qualify for funding as a career technical center, it must make application to the division of career technical education on or before the fifteenth of April for the following fiscal year. This includes applicants for new centers and renewal applications. Approved public charter schools with career technical education programs will receive the same added cost unit as any other eligible center on an actual approved cost basis not to exceed the per-student cost for a traditional instructional delivery method. All career technical centers must meet all three (3) of the following criteria:\n\n(a) The program serves students from two (2) or more high schools. No one (1) high school can comprise more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the total enrolled career technical center students, unless it is a new program in the first or second year of operation. During the first year of operation of a new program, no more than one (1) high school may comprise more than ninety-five percent (95%) of the total enrolled career technical students and no more than ninety percent (90%) of the total enrolled career technical students during the second year of operation. In the event a student enrolled in the career technical center is not enrolled in a public high school or is attending the sponsoring school district’s high school through the school district’s open enrollment policy for the purpose of accessing the career technical education program, the eighty-five percent (85%) will be calculated based on the public high school attendance area where the student resides. This provision does not exclude a public charter school with a statewide boundary from applying for appropriate added cost funds authorized for career technical education, irrespective of the instructional delivery method. In the event an existing career technical program that has been in operation for more than three (3) years should have the enrollment of career technical students increase to more than eighty-five percent (85%) in a single year, the division of career technical education may choose, with an approved enrollment plan, to use the program’s three (3) year rolling average enrollment between participating high schools for determining eligibility.\n\n(b) The majority of the program’s offerings lead to some form of postsecondary credit, such as dual credit or other advanced opportunities, as defined by the state board of education, or include apprenticeship opportunities.\n\n(c) All programs offer at least one (1) supervised field experience for all students.\n\n(2) All career technical centers must also meet at least one (1) of the following three (3) requirements:\n\n(a) The center is funded separately from schools that qualify for computation using regular secondary support units.\n\n(b) The center has a separate and distinct governing board.\n\n(c) The majority of the programs are provided at dedicated facilities that are separate from the regular high school facilities.\n\n(3) An eligible cooperative service agency, formed pursuant to section 33-317, Idaho Code, must own or maintain a facility separate from any of the member school districts making up the cooperative service agency.\n\n[33-1002G, added 1998, ch. 261, sec. 2, p. 864; am. 1999, ch. 329, sec. 2, p. 854; am. 2016, ch. 25, sec. 7, p. 39; am. 2018, ch. 341, sec. 1, p. 781; am. 2019, ch. 298, sec. 1, p. 881; am. 2022, ch. 14, sec. 1, p. 33; am. 2023, ch. 271, sec. 1, p. 814.]",

(1) Decrease in Average Daily Attendance. — For any school district that has a decrease in total average daily attendance of three percent (3%) or more of its average daily attendance in the current school year from the total average daily attendance used for determining the allowance in the educational support program for the prior school year, the allowance of funds from the educational support program may be based on the average daily attendance of the prior school year, less three percent (3%). When this provision is applied, the decrease in average daily attendance shall be proportionately distributed among the various categories of support units that are appropriate for the district. After applying the provisions of this subsection, the state department of education shall calculate the percentage of additional statewide support units to total statewide support units and shall then reduce each school district’s support units by this uniform percentage. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to public charter schools.\n\n(2) Application of Support Program to Separate Schools/Attendance Units in District.\n\n(a) Separate Elementary School. — Any separate elementary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only elementary school operated by the district.\n\n(b) Hardship Elementary School. — Upon application of the board of trustees of a school district, the state board of education is empowered to determine that a given elementary school or elementary schools within the school district, not otherwise qualifying, are entitled to be counted as a separate elementary school as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, when, in the discretion of the state board of education, special conditions exist warranting the retention of the school as a separate attendance unit and the retention results in a substantial increase in cost per pupil in average daily attendance above the average cost per pupil in average daily attendance of the remainder of the district’s elementary grade school pupils. An elementary school operating as a previously approved hardship elementary school shall continue to be considered as a separate attendance unit, unless the hardship status of the elementary school is rescinded by the state board of education.\n\n(c) Separate Secondary School. — Any separate secondary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only secondary school operated by the district.\n\n(d) Elementary/Secondary School Attendance Units. — Elementary grades in an elementary/secondary school will be funded as a separate attendance unit if all elementary grades served are located more than ten (10) miles distance by an all-weather road from both the nearest like elementary grades within the same school district and from the location of the office of the superintendent of schools of such district, or from the office of the chief administrative officer of such district if the district employs no superintendent of schools. Secondary grades in an elementary/secondary school will be funded as a separate attendance unit if all secondary grades served are located more than fifteen (15) miles by an all-weather road from the nearest like secondary grades operated by the district.\n\n(e) Hardship Secondary School. — Any district that operated two (2) secondary schools separated by less than fifteen (15) miles, but which district was created through consolidation subsequent to legislative action pursuant to chapter 111, laws of 1947, and which school buildings were constructed prior to 1935, shall be entitled to count the schools as separate attendance units.\n\n(f) Minimum Pupils Required. — Any elementary school having less than ten (10) pupils in average daily attendance shall not be allowed to participate in the state or county support program unless the school has been approved for operation by the state board of education.\n\n(3) Remote Schools. — The board of trustees of any Idaho school district that operates and maintains a school that is remote and isolated from the other schools of the state because of geographical or topographical conditions may petition the state board of education to recognize and approve the school as a remote and necessary school. The petition shall be in form and content approved by the state board of education and shall provide such information as the state board of education may require. Petitions for the recognition of a school as a remote and necessary school shall be filed annually at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of the regular June meeting of the board of trustees.\n\nWithin forty-five (45) days after the receipt of a petition for the recognition of a remote and necessary school, the state board of education shall either approve or disapprove the petition and notify the board of trustees of its decision. Schools that the state board of education approves as being necessary and remote shall be allowed adequate funding within the support program for an acceptable educational program for the students of the school. In the case of a remote and necessary secondary school, grades 7-12, the educational program shall be deemed acceptable when, in the opinion of the state board of education, the accreditation standard relating to staff size, established in accordance with the provisions of section 33-119, Idaho Code, has been met. The final determination of an acceptable program and adequate funding in the case of a remote and necessary elementary school shall be made by the state board of education.\n\n(4) Support Program When District Boundaries are Changed.\n\n(a) In new districts formed by the division of a district, the support program computed for the district, divided in its last year of operation, shall be apportioned to the new districts created by the division in the proportion that the average daily attendance of pupils, elementary and secondary combined, residing in the area of each new district so created, is to the average daily attendance of all pupils, elementary and secondary combined, in the district divided in its last year of operation before the division.\n\n(b) When boundaries of districts are changed by excision or annexation of territory, the support program of any district from which territory is excised for the last year of operation before such excision shall be divided, and apportioned among the districts involved, as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\n\n(c) In new districts formed by consolidation of former districts after January 1, 2007, the support program allowance, for a seven (7) year period following the formation of the new district, shall not be less than the combined support program allowances of the component districts in the last year of operation before consolidation. After the expiration of this period, the state department of education shall annually calculate the number of support units that would have been generated had the previous school districts not consolidated. All applicable state funding to the consolidated district shall then be provided based on a support unit number that is halfway between this figure and the actual support units, provided that it cannot be less than the actual support units.\n\n[33-1003, added 2013, ch. 184, sec. 2, p. 441; am. 2018, ch. 164, sec. 7, p. 326.]",

If the district does not employ the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number employed, except as provided in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section;\n\n(3) Determine the pupil service staff allowance by multiplying the support units by.079;\n\n(4) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .075;\n\n(5) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .375;\n\n(6) Additional conditions governing staff allowance:\n\n(a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted in the staff allowance. A \"nondistrict employee\" means a person for whom the school district does not pay the employer’s obligations for employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be allowable for computations.\n\n(b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff allowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state department of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted.\n\n(c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units:\n\n(i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance; and\n\n(ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual administrative staff employed in the school year is greater than the administrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff allowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance.\n\n(iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20) support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the number of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be increased as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph and by an additional one-half (1/2) instructional staff allowance.\n\n(d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades 9 through 12, the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school.\n\n(e) Only instructional, pupil service and administrative staff and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, including determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district’s salary-based apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance.\n\n(f) A district may utilize up to fifteen percent (15%) of the moneys associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to pay another school district or public charter school for instructional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual education coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.\n\n(g) A district may employ nine and one-half percent (9.5%) fewer positions than funded pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.\n\n(7) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insufficient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state board of education demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be limited to one (1) year but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justification.\n\n(8) A district may utilize a portion of the instructional staff allowance provided for in this section for kindergarten teachers to visit the parents or guardians of students during the first week of the kindergarten school year. Such visits may take place at school, at the student’s home or at another location agreed to by the teacher and parents or guardians. The purpose of such visits is to help strengthen the working relationship between the teacher, the parents or guardians, and the student. The visits should be used as an opportunity to help establish the teacher’s expectations of the student. The visit should also provide an opportunity for the parents or guardians to explain their expectations. The amount of moneys to be expended for such visits by the district may not exceed the amount equal to one (1) week of instructional staff allowance computed for kindergarten instructors in the district.\n\n[33-1004, added 1994, ch. 428, sec. 5, p. 1375; am. 1995, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 119; am. 1995, ch. 271, sec. 1, p. 871; am. 1998, ch. 166, sec. 1, p. 561; am. 2003, ch. 375, sec. 5, p. 1004; am. 2006, ch. 412, sec. 1, p. 1249; am. 2006, 1st Ex.

The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff determined as provided in section 33-1004(2), Idaho Code. Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of education. No full-time instructional staff member or pupil service staff member on the residency compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the career ladder residency compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(2) Effective July 1, 2022, no full-time instructional staff member or pupil service staff member on the professional or advanced professional compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the career ladder professional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(3) Effective July 1, 2025, no full-time instructional staff member or pupil service staff member on the advanced professional compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the advanced professional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(4) If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall receive two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year for five (5) years from the year in which national board certification was earned.

The resulting amount is the district’s salary-based apportionment for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase shall be those who have been recognized as national board-certified teachers as of July 1 of each year.\n\n(5) To determine the apportionment for pupil service staff, take the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. If the district does not employ any pupil service staff, the district’s pupil service staff average salary shall equal the district’s instructional staff average salary for purposes of calculating pupil service salary-based apportionment. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for pupil service staff determined pursuant to section 33-1004(3), Idaho Code. Full-time pupil service staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of education. The resulting amount is the district’s salary-based apportionment for pupil service staff. No full-time pupil service staff member shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the career ladder residency compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(6) To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. If the district does not employ any administrative staff, the district administrative index shall equal the statewide average index for purposes of calculating administrative salary-based apportionment. On and after July 1, 2025, the district administrative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of forty-six thousand six hundred sixty-eight dollars ($46,668). The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33-1004(4), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district’s salary-based apportionment for administrative staff.\n\n(7) On and after July 1, 2025, to determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply forty-one thousand nine hundred sixty-four dollars ($41,964) by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section 33-1004(5), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district’s apportionment for classified staff.\n\n(8) The district’s salary-based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections (1), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this section, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33-1004F, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-1004E, added 2016, ch. 245, sec. 8, p. 653; am. 2016, ch. 257, sec. 4, p. 676; am. 2016, ch. 306, sec. 4, p. 862; am. 2017, ch. 252, sec. 4, p. 624; am. 2017, ch. 254, sec. 4, p. 627; am. 2018, ch. 229, sec. 4, p. 538; am. 2018, ch. 283, sec. 4, p. 669; am. 2019, ch. 119, sec. 4, p. 445; am. 2019, ch. 121, sec. 4, p. 449; am. 2020, ch. 270, sec. 4, p. 788; am. 2020, ch. 272, sec. 3, p. 802; am. 2020, ch. 298, sec. 4, p. 867; am. 2020, ch. 300, sec. 4, p. 871; am. 2021, ch. 312, sec. 4, p. 927; am. 2021, ch. 338, sec. 4, p. 1029; am. 2022, ch. 247, sec. 3, p. 810; am. 2022, ch. 248, sec. 3, p. 814; am. 2022, ch. 264, sec. 1, p. 850; am. 2023, ch. 224, sec. 3, p. 695; am. 2023, ch. 277, sec. 3, p. 831; am. 2024, ch. 205, sec. 10, p. 725; am. 2024, ch. 303, sec. 11, p. 1021; am. 2025, ch. 211, sec. 16, p. 982; am. 2025, ch. 287, sec. 4, p. 1215.]",

(1) The state board of education shall determine what costs of transporting pupils, including maintenance, operation and depreciation of basic vehicles, insurance, payments under contract with other public transportation providers whose vehicles used to transport pupils comply with federal transit administration regulations, \"bus testing,\" 49 CFR part 665, and any revision thereto, as provided in subsection (4)(d) of this section, or other state department of education-approved private transportation providers, salaries of drivers, and any other costs, shall be allowable in computing the transportation support program of authorized transportation operations.\n\n(2) Any costs associated with the addition of vehicle features that are not part of the basic vehicle shall not be allowable in computing the transportation support program of an authorized transportation operation. A basic vehicle is hereby defined as the cost of the vehicle without optional features, plus the addition of essential safety features and features necessary for the transportation of pupils with disabilities.\n\n(3) Each authorized transportation operation shall maintain records and make reports as are required for the purposes of this section.\n\n(4) The transportation support program of an authorized transportation operation shall be based upon the allowable costs of:\n\n(a) Transporting public school pupils one and one-half (1 1/2) miles or more to school;\n\n(b) Transporting pupils less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles as provided in section 33-1501, Idaho Code, when approved by the state board of education;\n\n(c) Payments when transportation is not furnished, as provided in section 33-1503, Idaho Code;\n\n(d) The transportation program for kindergarten through grade 12, upon the costs of payments pursuant to a contract with other public or private transportation providers entered into as provided in section 33-1510, Idaho Code, if the authorized transportation operation establishes that the reimbursable costs of transportation under the contract are equal to or less than the costs for school buses;\n\n(e) The employer’s share of contributions to the public employee retirement system and to social security; and\n\n(f) Providing transportation to and from approved school activities as may be approved by the rules of the state board of education.\n\n(5) The state’s share of the transportation support program shall be fifty percent (50%) of reimbursable transportation costs incurred by the authorized transportation operation during the immediately preceding state fiscal year, except for the cost of state department of education training and fee assessments and bus depreciation and maintenance, for which the state’s share shall be eighty-five percent (85%) of such costs. The state’s share for authorized transportation operations that contract for pupil transportation services shall be the average state share of costs for authorized transportation operations that are school district-run operations, based on the statewide total of such costs. Provided however, that the reimbursable costs for any authorized transportation operation shall not exceed one hundred three percent (103%) of the statewide average reimbursable cost per mile or the statewide average reimbursable cost per student rider, whichever is more advantageous to the authorized transportation provider. If an authorized transportation operation’s costs exceed the one hundred three percent (103%) limit when computed by the more advantageous of the two (2) methods, that authorized transportation operation shall be reimbursed at the appropriate percentage designated by this subsection, multiplied by the maximum limit for whichever method is more favorable to the authorized transportation operation. An authorized transportation operation may appeal the application of the one hundred three percent (103%) limit on reimbursable costs to the state board of education, which may establish for that authorized transportation operation a new percentile limit for reimbursable costs compared to the statewide average, which is higher than one hundred three percent (103%). In doing so, the state board of education may set a new limit that is greater than one hundred three percent (103%), but is less than the percentile limit requested by the authorized transportation operation. However, the percentage increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap shall not exceed the percentage of the authorized transportation operation’s bus runs that qualify as a hardship bus run, pursuant to this subsection. Any costs above the new level established by the state board of education shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall only be granted by the state board of education for hardship bus runs. To qualify as a hardship bus run, such bus run shall meet at least two (2) of the following criteria:\n\n(a) The number of student riders per mile is less than fifty percent (50%) of the statewide average number of student riders per mile;\n\n(b) Less than a majority of the miles on the bus run are by paved surface, concrete or asphalt road;\n\n(c) Over ten percent (10%) of the miles driven on the bus run are a five percent (5%) slope or greater.\n\n(6) Beginning on July 1, 2005, any eligible home-based public virtual school may claim transportation reimbursement for the prior fiscal year’s cost of providing educational services to students. In order to be eligible, such a school shall have at least one (1) average daily attendance divisor, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that is greater than the median divisor shown for any category of pupils, among the actual divisors listed. For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection, \"education provider\" means the home-based public virtual school or an entity that has legally contracted with the home-based public virtual school to supply education services. Reimbursable costs shall be limited to the costs of:\n\n(a) Providing an internet connection service between the student and the education provider, not including the cost of telephone service;\n\n(b) Providing electronic and computer equipment used by the student to transmit educational material between the student and the education provider;\n\n(c) Providing a toll-free telephone service for students to communicate with the education provider;\n\n(d) Providing education-related, face-to-face visits by representatives of the home-based public virtual school, with such reimbursements limited to the mileage costs set for state employee travel by the state board of examiners; and\n\n(e) Any actual pupil transportation costs that would be reimbursable if claimed by an authorized transportation operation that is a school district.\n\nThe total reimbursement for such home-based public virtual schools shall be exempt from the statewide average cost per mile limitations of this section. The state’s share of reimbursable costs shall be eighty-five percent (85%), subject to the statewide cost per student rider provisions of this section. For the purposes of such home-based public virtual school, the number of student riders shall be the same as the number of pupils in average daily attendance.\n\n(7) The state department of education shall calculate the amount of state funds lost in fiscal year 2010 by each authorized transportation operation as a result of the decrease in the state reimbursement from eighty-five percent (85%) to fifty percent (50%) of certain eligible costs, including the reduction calculated for authorized transportation operations that contract for pupil transportation services, and excluding any reductions made due to the limitation on reimbursable expenses, all pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. The amount so calculated shall be distributed to each authorized transportation operation in fiscal year 2010. For each fiscal year thereafter, the amount distributed pursuant to this subsection for each authorized transportation operation shall be determined as follows:\n\n(a) Divide the amount distributed to the authorized transportation operation pursuant to this subsection in fiscal year 2010 by the authorized transportation operation’s support units for fiscal year 2010;\n\n(b) Multiply the result of the calculation found in paragraph (a) of this subsection by the number of support units in the current fiscal year, excluding any support units attributable to students educated primarily through home-based or virtual means;\n\n(c) Determine the percentage change in statewide transportation reimbursements as provided for in subsection (5) of this section since fiscal year 2010;\n\n(d) Determine the percentage change in statewide student enrollment since fiscal year 2010;\n\n(e) Subtract the result of the calculation found in paragraph (d) of this subsection from the result of the calculation found in paragraph (c) of this subsection;\n\n(f) Adjust the result of the calculation found in paragraph (b) of this subsection by the percentage result from paragraph (e) of this subsection.\n\nFor authorized transportation operations that are school districts that divided after fiscal year 2010, the calculation in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall still be based on the fiscal year 2010 figures for the formerly consolidated district. For authorized transportation operations that are public charter schools beginning operations on or after July 1, 2009, all calculations in this subsection that are based on fiscal year 2010 shall instead be based on the public charter school’s first fiscal year of operations. For the purposes of this subsection, the support units used shall be the number used for calculating salary-based apportionment. Funds distributed pursuant to this subsection shall be used to defray the cost of pupil transportation. If the amount distributed is in excess of an authorized transportation operation’s actual pupil transportation costs, less any state reimbursements provided by subsection (5) of this section, the excess funds may be used at the authorized transportation operation’s discretion.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, the state’s share of the transportation support program will be based on reimbursable transportation costs incurred by an authorized transportation provider during the state fiscal year prior to the immediately preceding state fiscal year if, during the immediately preceding state fiscal year:\n\n(a) An emergency occurred in the state or in the area where the authorized transportation operation is located. For purposes of this subsection, an emergency includes but is not limited to school closures caused by extreme weather conditions, a fire, an epidemic, or pollution of air or water; and\n\n(b) As a direct result of such emergency, the reimbursable transportation costs of an authorized transportation operation decreased by at least ten percent (10%) from the prior fiscal year.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, for the duration of an emergency described in subsection (8) of this section, the miles for which transportation costs may be reimbursed will be miles:\n\n(a) Directly associated with transporting students for the purpose of school attendance during regular days and hours; or\n\n(b) Related to the delivery of food, delivery of instructional materials, or other trips supporting the continuation of educational services.\n\n(10) As used in this section, \"authorized transportation operation\" means a school district or public charter school transportation program authorized by the state department of education that may include the use of any vehicles authorized pursuant to chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-1006, added 1963, ch. 13, sec. 130, p. 27; am. 1969, ch. 198, sec. 1, p. 582; am. 1974, ch. 207, sec. 1, p. 1536; am. 1979, ch. 254, sec. 8, p. 670; am. 1980, ch. 179, sec. 7, p. 390; am. 1994, ch. 428, sec. 11, p. 1379; am. 1997, ch. 281, sec. 1, p. 853; am. 2003, ch. 372, sec. 11, p. 993; am. 2004, ch. 370, sec. 1, p. 1095; am. 2007, ch. 352, sec. 10, p. 1040; am. 2009, ch. 284, sec. 1, p. 852; am. 2010, ch. 234, sec. 33, p. 537; am. 2012, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 148; am. 2013, ch. 168, sec. 1, p. 386; am. 2017, ch. 117, sec. 1, p. 268; am. 2021, ch. 248, sec. 1, p. 771; am. 2025, ch. 278, sec. 1, p. 1175.]",

The state department of education shall distribute to the school district the full amount of the special transfer as soon as practical after such transfer is made. In making the levy computations required by this subsection the state department of education shall take into account and consider the full amount of money receipted into the public school income fund from all sources for the given fiscal year. Deficits in the transfer of the appropriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official estimated amount from those sources.

There is hereby created a fund in the state treasury to be known as the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund to which shall be credited all moneys that may be appropriated, apportioned, allocated and paid back to that fund. Moneys in this fund shall be used exclusively as provided in this section, except that moneys in this fund shall be returned to the budget stabilization fund as provided in this section.\n\n(2) Approval of loan or grant. A school district that does not have the financial resources to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified pursuant to section 33-1613, Idaho Code, and that is eligible to seek additional funds under subsection (5)(b)(ii) of section 33-1613, Idaho Code, may apply to the state treasurer for a loan and, if eligible, a grant from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund. A school district that has borrowed money from the Idaho safe school facilities loan program may apply for a grant of interest from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund. The loan or grant shall be approved if the school district’s application meets the criteria of section 33-1613, Idaho Code, and of this section. If the board of examiners finds that existing and anticipated loans or grants under this section have depleted the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund to an extent that the fund does not have available sufficient moneys to loan to an eligible school district, the board of examiners shall declare that additional loans may be made from the budget stabilization fund provided in section 57-814, Idaho Code, up to any limits of the use of that fund provided by statute or declared by the governor in times of general revenue shortfalls or major disaster.\n\n(3) Conditions of loan or grant — Repayment of loan.\n\n(a) The school district’s application shall identify the unsafe or unhealthy conditions that would be abated with the proceeds of the loan or grant and, if a loan, shall propose a method of and timetable for abating those conditions and for repaying the loan.\n\n(b) The state treasurer shall review the application to determine whether the application is for abatement of unsafe or unhealthy conditions as described in section 33-1613, Idaho Code, and to determine whether the estimated costs of abatement and proposed plan of abatement are reasonable. In reviewing the application, the state treasurer may call upon the assistance of the state division of occupational and professional licenses, the state fire marshal, the state department of administration, the state board of education, the state department of education, or other knowledgeable persons to determine whether conditions identified to be abated meet the criteria of section 33-1613, Idaho Code, and to determine whether the plan of abatement, estimated costs of abatement and proposed methods of abatement are reasonable. The state treasurer shall process the application for a loan or grant within thirty-five (35) days after its receipt.\n\n(i) If the state treasurer determines that the application has not identified unsafe or unhealthy conditions as described in section 33-1613, Idaho Code, the state treasurer shall return the application with a written statement that contains reasons why the loan or grant application does not meet the criteria of this section and of section 33-1613, Idaho Code.\n\n(ii) If the state treasurer determines that the application has identified unsafe or unhealthy conditions as described in section 33-1613, Idaho Code, the state treasurer shall then determine whether the application has proposed reasonable methods of abatement and reasonable estimates of costs of abatement. The state treasurer shall approve the plan of abatement if the school district has proposed a reasonable method of abatement and if its estimated costs of abatement are reasonable; otherwise, the state treasurer shall return the application with a written statement how the application can be amended to qualify.\n\n(c) If the application is for a loan, the state treasurer may accept the school district’s proposed method of and timetable for repaying the loan or may impose reasonable alternative or substitute methods of and timetables for repayment consistent with this subsection, which alternative or substitute methods shall be binding on the school district. At a minimum, the school district shall be required to repay in each fiscal year succeeding the year of the loan an amount no less than the lottery proceeds that the school district would otherwise receive for that fiscal year and additional foundation support moneys, if any, accruing as a result of an initial overestimation of state average daily attendance support units and later distribution of residual amounts resulting from fewer support units than originally estimated. The loan shall provide for the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund, or the budget stabilization fund, to the extent that it was the source of the loan, to intercept the lottery proceeds that would otherwise go to the school district until the loan is fully repaid. In addition, the state treasurer may impose reasonable fiscal conditions on the school district during the term of loan repayment including, but not limited to, restrictions in use of otherwise unrestricted school district moneys to assist in repayment of the loan or in abatement of unsafe or unhealthy conditions, the declaration of a financial emergency during some or all of the term of repayment of the loan, or interception by the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund of a portion of the state foundation program payments under chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code, that would otherwise go to the school district to repay the loan. The initial term of the loan shall not exceed ten (10) years, but may be extended in the state treasurer’s discretion for another ten (10) years.\n\n(d) If a loan is approved, the state treasurer shall establish a line of credit for the school district and monthly reimburse the school district for costs incurred to abate the unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified as the reason for the loan. The state treasurer may prescribe forms and procedures for administration of this line of credit.\n\n(e) A school district may repay its loan or any portion of its loan in advance at any time without penalty.\n\n(4) Interest. Loans to school districts under this section shall bear interest at the average rate of interest that would be available to the state treasury were the loan funds retained in the state treasury, as determined by the state treasurer.\n\n(5) Certification of loan funds spent. If a school district obtains a loan pursuant to this section, the board of trustees shall certify the total expenditures of loaned funds that were actually spent to abate unsafe and unhealthy conditions.\n\n(6) Excess funds. If any funds loaned pursuant to this section were not spent on abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions, they must be returned to the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund or the budget stabilization fund, as the case may be. This subsection shall be judicially enforceable by the state treasurer, and any amounts due for repayment under this subsection may be recovered by offset from state foundation program moneys that would otherwise be paid to the school district.\n\n(7) Eligibility for grant. After complying with the provisions of section 33-1613, Idaho Code, school districts that borrow money from the Idaho safe schools facilities loan program pursuant to section 33-804A, Idaho Code, or that refinance through the Idaho safe schools facilities loan program loans for money borrowed under this section or that finance abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions through indebtedness pursuant to chapter 11, title 33, Idaho Code, may apply for a grant from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund to pay for eligible interest costs incurred on loan proceeds used to abate unsafe and unhealthy conditions. If the school district’s application for a grant is accepted, then the school district will qualify for a grant of the present value of the qualifying percentage of the interest costs of the loan associated with abating unsafe and unhealthy conditions as follows:\n\n(a) If the school district is participating in the Idaho safe schools facilities loan program, within seven (7) days after the approved school district receives loan proceeds from the Idaho safe schools facilities loan fund, the state treasurer shall provide funds to the school district in the amount of the qualifying percentage of the present value of the interest costs associated with abating unsafe and unhealthy conditions.\n\n(b) If a school district has obtained a loan from the school health and safety revolving loan and grant fund and has refinanced its loan through the Idaho safe schools facilities program and prepays the outstanding principal of its loan, the school district shall be eligible for a grant of the qualifying percentage of the present value of the outstanding interest costs associated with the prepaid principal.\n\n(c) If the school district has financed the abatement of unsafe or unhealthy conditions through indebtedness pursuant to chapter 11, title 33, Idaho Code, within seven (7) days after the school district receives bond proceeds, the state treasurer shall provide funds to the school district in the amount of the qualifying percentage of the present value of the interest costs associated with abating unsafe and unhealthy conditions.\n\n(8) Present value. The present value of the interest costs associated with money borrowed under the Idaho safe schools facilities loan program shall be calculated by the state treasurer using a method of equal annual loan payments and a discount rate of the interest rate prescribed in subsection (4) of this section on the date that the school district receives funds from the Idaho safe schools facilities loan fund. The present value of the unpaid interest costs for principal prepayments to the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund shall be calculated by the state treasurer by summing the unpaid interest that would be paid without the principal prepayment and discounting it at the interest rate prescribed in subsection (4) of this section on the date that the treasurer receives the prepayment. The present value of the interest costs associated with money borrowed by a school district in a bond issue shall be calculated by the state treasurer using the school district’s actual schedule for making interest payments on the bonds and discounting those interest payments by the interest rate prescribed in subsection (4) of this section on the date that the school district receives funds from the bond issue.\n\n(9) Qualifying percentage. The qualifying percentage of the interest costs of a school district applying for a grant of interest under this section shall be determined as follows: For a school district borrowing money under the Idaho safe schools facilities loan program or refinancing a loan made under this section with money borrowed under the Idaho safe schools facilities program or incurring bonded indebtedness for safe and healthy schools, the state treasurer shall express:\n\n(a) The total of the bond and plant facilities levies imposed by the school district (including the levy for which the application is made); and\n\n(b) The total levies imposed by the school district (including the levy for which the application is made)\n\nas a fraction of assessed value for the most recent assessment against which the school district’s existing levies are made. The qualifying percentage of interest granted under this section shall be the higher of the amounts shown in the following tables:\n\nTable 1 – Bond and Plant Facilities Levies\n\nBond Plus Plant Facilities Levy\n\nLess than.0019\n\nMore than.0019 and less than.0029\n\nMore than.0029 and less than.0039\n\nMore than.0039\n\nTable 2 – Total Levies\n\nLess than.0060\n\nMore than.0060 and less than.0072\n\nMore than.0072 and less than.0084\n\nMore than.0084 and less than.0096\n\nMore than.0096\n\n(10) Interest costs for abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions. The interest costs for abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions shall be calculated by determining the percentage of the loan proceeds or prepayment of the loan that will be used to abate unsafe and unhealthy conditions.\n\n(11) Procedures. The state treasurer may prescribe forms for applying for a loan or grant under this section. No actions taken under this section are contested cases or rulemaking subject to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and none of the contested case or rulemaking procedures of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, apply to actions taken under this section.\n\n(12) The state treasurer’s authority to accept applications for and to approve grants of interest from the school safety and health revolving loan and grant fund shall cease on July 1, 2003.\n\n[33-1017, added 2000, ch. 219, sec. 2, p. 610; am. 2001, ch. 326, sec. 2, p. 1144; am. 2002, ch. 157, sec. 1, p. 453; am. 2023, ch. 15, sec. 4, p. 71.]",
