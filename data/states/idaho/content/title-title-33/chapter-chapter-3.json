The election shall be conducted, and the ballots shall be canvassed, according to the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code. The division shall be approved only if a majority of all votes cast at said special election by the school district electors residing within the entire existing school district and voting in the election are in favor of the division of such district, and a majority of all votes cast at said special election by the qualified voters within that portion of the proposed new district having a minority of the number of qualified voters, such portion to be determined by the number of votes cast in each area which is a contemplated new district, are in favor of the division of the district, and upon such approval two (2) new school districts shall be thereby created. The organization and division of all school districts which have divided since June 30, 1963, are hereby validated.\n\nIf the division is approved, as herein provided, two (2) new school districts are thereby created. The board of canvassers shall thereupon promptly notify the state department of education and the affected school districts of such result. The superintendent of public instruction shall make an appropriate order showing the creation of the districts and a legal description of the boundaries, and the legal descriptions of the affected school districts shall be altered, as prescribed in section 33-307, Idaho Code.\n\n[33-312, added 1963, ch. 13, sec. 42, p. 27; am. 1963, ch. 175, sec. 1, p. 501; am. 1965, ch. 272, sec. 1, p. 699; am. 1969, ch. 152, sec. 1, p. 478; am. 2009, ch. 107, sec. 4, p. 342; am. 2009, ch. 341, sec. 26, p. 1010; am. 2011, ch. 151, sec. 14, p. 425.]",

The boundaries of the several trustee zones in each such school district shall be defined and drawn so that, as reasonably as may be, each such zone shall have approximately the same population.\n\n(3) Whenever the area of any district has been enlarged by the annexation of all or any part of another district, or by the correction of errors in the legal description of school district boundaries, any such additional territory shall be included in the trustee zone or zones contiguous to such additional territory until such time as the trustee zones may be redefined and changed. Trustee zones may be redefined and changed not more than once every five (5) years in the manner hereinafter provided.\n\n(4) A proposal to redefine and change trustee zones of any district may be initiated by its board of trustees and shall be initiated by its board of trustees at the first meeting following the report of the decennial census, and submitted to the state board of education, or by petition signed by not less than fifty (50) school electors residing in the district, and presented to the board of trustees of the district. Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the decennial census or the receipt of a petition to redefine and change the trustee zones of a district the board of trustees shall prepare a proposal for a change which will equalize the population in each zone in the district and shall submit the proposal to the state board of education. Any proposal shall include a legal description of each trustee zone as the same would appear as proposed, a map of the district showing how each trustee zone would then appear, and the approximate population each would then have, should the proposal to change any trustee zones become effective.\n\n(5) Within sixty (60) days after it has received the said proposal the state board of education may approve or disapprove the proposal to redefine and change trustee zones and shall give notice thereof in writing to the board of trustees of the district wherein the change is proposed.

Should the state board of education approve the proposal, it shall notify the school district, the trustee zones shall be changed in accordance with the proposal and a copy of the legal description of each trustee zone and map of the district showing how each trustee zone will appear shall be filed by the school district with the county clerk.\n\n(6) At the next regular meeting of the board of trustees following the approval of the proposal the board shall appoint from its membership a trustee for each new zone to serve as trustee until that incumbent trustee’s term expires. If the current board membership includes two (2) incumbent trustees from the same new trustee zone, the board will select the incumbent trustee with the most seniority as a trustee to serve the remainder of his term. If both incumbent trustees have equal seniority, the board will choose one (1) of the trustees by the drawing of lots. If there is a trustee vacancy in any of the new zones, the board of trustees shall appoint from the patrons resident in that new trustee zone, a person from that zone to serve as trustee until the next annual meeting.

(1) Two (2) or more school districts may join together for educational purposes to form a service agency to purchase materials and/or provide services for use individually or in combination. The cooperative service agency thus formed shall be empowered to adopt bylaws, and act as a body corporate and politic with such powers as are assigned through its bylaws but limited to the powers and duties of local school districts. In its corporate capacity, this agency may sue and be sued and may acquire, hold and convey real and personal property necessary to its existence. The employees of the service agency shall be extended the same general rights, privileges and responsibilities as comparable employees of a school district. The cooperative service agency may elect to be its own fiscal agent for the purposes of providing an alternative school program, with the concurrence of the school districts for which it provides such services. In doing so the educational support program payments made pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that would have been distributed to the school district acting as the fiscal agent, shall instead be distributed to the cooperative service agency.\n\n(2) A properly constituted cooperative service agency may request from its member school districts funding to be furnished by a tax levy not to exceed one-tenth of one percent (.1%) for a period not to exceed ten (10) years by such member school districts.

Such levy must be authorized by an election held subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, and be conducted in each of the school districts pursuant to chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code, and approved by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the district electors voting in such election.

There is no limit on the number of elections which may be held for the purpose of continuing the levy authorized under this subsection (3) for an additional ten (10) years.

(1) For the purpose of constructing and maintaining facilities of a cooperative service agency, a properly constituted cooperative service agency may request from its member school districts additional funding to be furnished by a tax levy not to exceed four-tenths of one percent (.4%) of market value for assessment purposes in each year, as such valuation existed on December 31, of the previous year, for a period not to exceed three (3) years. Such levy shall be authorized by an election held in each of the school districts pursuant to chapter 4, title 33, Idaho Code. The question of a levy to be submitted to the electors of each member school district and the notice of such election shall state the dollar amount proposed to be collected each year during the period of years in each of which the collection is proposed to be made, the percentage of votes in favor of the proposal which are needed to approve the proposed dollar amount to be collected, and the purposes for which such funds shall be used. Said notice shall be given, the election shall be conducted and the returns canvassed as provided in chapter 4, title 33, Idaho Code; and the dollar amount to be collected shall be approved only if:\n\n(a) Fifty-five percent (55%) of the district electors voting in such election are in favor thereof if the levy will result in a total levy for school plant facilities of less than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of market value for assessment purposes as such valuation existed on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the election;\n\n(b) Sixty percent (60%) of the district electors voting in such election are in favor thereof if the levy will result in a total levy for school plant facilities of two-tenths of one percent (.2%) or more and less than three-tenths of one percent (.3%) of market value for assessment purposes as such valuation existed on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the election; or\n\n(c) Two-thirds (2/3) of the district electors voting in such election are in favor thereof if the levy will result in a total levy for school plant facilities of three-tenths of one percent (.3%) or more of market value for assessment purposes as such valuation existed on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the election.\n\nIf the question be approved, each member school district of the cooperative service agency may make a levy, not to exceed four-tenths of one percent (.4%) of market value for assessment purposes as such valuation existed on December 31 of the previous year, in each year for which the collection was approved, sufficient to collect the dollar amount approved and may again submit the question at the expiration of the period of such levy, for the dollar amount to be collected during each year, and the number of years which the board may at that time determine. Or, during the period approved at any such election, if such period be less than three (3) years or the levy be less than four-tenths of one percent (.4%) of market value for assessment purposes as such valuation existed on December 31 of the previous year, the cooperative service agency may request that its member school districts submit to the qualified school district electors in the same manner as before, the question whether the number of years, not to exceed three (3), or the levy, or both, be increased, but not to exceed the maximum herein authorized. If such increase or increases be approved by the electors, the terms of such levy shall be in lieu of those approved in the first instance, but disapproval shall not affect any terms theretofore in effect.\n\n(2) Physical construction may commence once moneys equal to the estimated cost of constructing the facility have been collected by the cooperative service agency, except that the cooperative service agency may commence physical construction before moneys equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost of constructing the facility have been collected as long as language is included in the instructions to bidders reflecting the following:\n\n(a) Providing notice of the funding method and schedule;\n\n(b) Clearly stating that if all moneys are not collected according to the schedule provided, the contractor may not be paid in a timely manner and such contractor will have to await payment until the necessary moneys are collected, but in no event shall such contractor have to await payment longer than three (3) years from the date of the contractor’s last pay request;\n\n(c) Stating that the cooperative service agency accepts no liability and will pay no interest on unpaid balances;\n\n(d) Stating that should an inability to pay occur after the fifty percent (50%) completion point of the project, the contractor must complete the project irrespective of payment status; and\n\n(e) Stating that if an inability to pay occurs before the fifty percent (50%) completion point, the contractor has the option to suspend work, receiving no compensation for delay, and restart the project when funding becomes available.\n\n(3) If one (1) or more of the member districts fails to approve the tax levy in such election, the cooperative service agency may construct the facility through the support of the member districts approving the levy, but in no event shall the levy limits authorized in this section be exceeded.\n\n(4) Nothing shall prevent a member district that initially failed to approve the levy from conducting a subsequent election, held pursuant to chapter 4, title 33, Idaho Code, to authorize that district’s participation in construction of the facility.\n\n(5) The administration and accounting of moneys received by imposition of the levy provided for in this section shall be the same as provided in section 33-317(2), Idaho Code.\n\n[33-317A, added 2009, ch. 220, sec. 2, p. 685; am. 2011, ch. 189, sec. 1, p. 540.]",
