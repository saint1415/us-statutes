The authorizer that approves a public school charter has no liability for the acts, omissions, debts, or other obligations of a public charter school, except as may be provided in the charter. A local public school district has no liability for the acts, omissions, debts, or other obligations of a public charter school located in its district that has been approved by an authorizer other than the board of trustees of the local school district.\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter prevents the charter holder from borrowing money to finance the purchase or lease of school building facilities, equipment, and furnishings.

Such financial agreement will be favorably considered during the application process. Where this paragraph is applicable, the education service provider shall make its audited financial statements available unless the education service provider already makes such audited financial statements publicly available for compliance with other federal or state laws; and\n\n(i) A plan for ensuring equal access for all students, including the provision of necessary hardware, software, and internet connectivity required for participation in online coursework, and utilization of remote testing, proctoring, and administration procedures for state-required assessments.\n\n(4) The authorizer shall afford applicants a hearing prior to making a decision, with an opportunity in a public forum for local residents to learn about and provide input on each application.

Within ten (10) days of the public hearing, the hearing officer shall submit a written recommendation to the authorizer and to the persons requesting the review. The recommendation by the hearing officer either to affirm or reverse the decision of the authorizer shall be based on the full record regarding the charter application, including the standards and criteria contained in this chapter.

Within ten (10) days of such meeting, the authorizer shall either affirm or reverse its initial decision. The authorizer’s decision shall be in writing and contain findings that explain the reasons for its decision.\n\n(c) If, upon reconsideration of a decision to deny an application for a public charter school, the authorizer:\n\n(i) Reverses its initial decision and approves the public charter school application, then there shall be no further appeal; or\n\n(ii) Affirms its initial decision denying the public charter school application, then the board of directors of the nonprofit corporation may appeal as set forth in chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(d) There shall be no appeal of a decision by a local school board of trustees that denies the conversion of an existing traditional public school within that district to a public charter school or a decision by an authorizer that approves an application for a public charter school.\n\n(7)(a) An approved initial charter shall be granted for a term of six (6) operating years. The charter shall include the beginning and ending dates of the charter term. An approved school may delay its opening for one (1) school year to plan and prepare for the school’s opening. A delay greater than one (1) school year requires an extension from the school’s authorizer.\n\n(b) In order to incubate innovative charter schools, an authorizer may instead grant a pilot charter with an initial term of three (3) operating years to test an innovative or novel model. This pilot charter shall be used in limited instances and the authorizer must provide sufficient documentation to justify the shorter term.\n\n[33-5205, added 2024, ch. 9, sec. 13, p. 66.]",

Where this paragraph is applicable, the educational services provider shall make its audited financial statements available, unless the educational services provider already makes such audited financial statements publicly available for compliance with other federal or state laws.\n\n(9) Admission procedures, including provision for over-enrollment, shall provide that the initial admission procedures for a public charter school will be determined by lottery or other random method, except as otherwise provided in this section. A charter holder shall strive to ensure that citizens in the primary attendance area are made aware of the enrollment opportunities and deadline. The public notice must include the enrollment deadline, the public charter school’s total enrollment capacity for the next school year, and an advisory that all prospective students will be given the opportunity to enroll in the public charter school regardless of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status, or special needs.\n\n(a) If initial capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely application, then the admission procedures may provide that preference shall be given in the following order: first, to children of founders, provided that this admission preference shall be limited to not more than ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the public charter school; second, to siblings of pupils already selected by the lottery or other random method; third, to pupils seeking to transfer from another Idaho public charter school or authorizer at which they have been enrolled for at least one (1) year, provided that this admission preference shall be subject to an existing written agreement for such preference between the subject charter schools or authorizer; fourth, to students residing within the primary attendance area of the public charter school; and fifth, by an equitable selection process such as a lottery or other random method. A public charter school may weight the school’s lottery to preference admission for the following educationally disadvantaged students: students living at or below one hundred eighty-five percent (185%) of the federal poverty level, students who are homeless or in foster care, children with disabilities as defined in section 33-2001, Idaho Code, students with limited English proficiency, and students who are at-risk as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code. A public charter school may include the children of full-time employees of the public charter school within the first priority group, subject to the limitations therein.\n\n(b) If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely application for subsequent school terms, then the admission procedures may provide that preference shall be given in the following order: first, to pupils returning to the public charter school in the second or any subsequent year of its operation; and then as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The sibling preference in subsequent school years applies to siblings of a returning pupil and of a pupil selected by the lottery or other random method. A new lottery shall be conducted each year to fill vacancies that become available. A public charter school may weight the school’s lottery to preference admission as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this subsection and for children who attended the public charter school within the previous three (3) school years but withdrew as a result of the relocation of a parent or guardian due to an academic sabbatical or an employer or military transfer or reassignment.\n\n(c) Each public charter school shall establish a process under which a child may apply for enrollment or register for courses, regardless of where such child resides at the time of application or registration, if the child is a dependent of a member of the United States armed forces who has received transfer orders to a location in Idaho and will, upon such transfer, reside in an area served by the public charter school. If capacity is insufficient as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, a child described in this paragraph shall be treated as a student residing within the primary attendance area of the public charter school for purposes of preference. Otherwise, such children shall be included in the highest priority group for which they would otherwise be eligible.\n\n(d) Admission to a public charter school shall be determined by a selection process held within seven (7) days of the enrollment deadlines established by the charter holder. The selection process must take place in a public setting, the date and time of which must be noticed to the public at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance.\n\n(e) Within seven (7) days after conducting the selection process, the charter holder shall send an offer to the legal guardian who submitted a written request for admission on behalf of a student notifying such person that the student has been selected for admission to the public charter school. An offer must be signed by such student’s parent or guardian and returned to the public charter school by the date designated in such offer letter. Remaining students shall be notified that they may be eligible for admission at a later date if a seat becomes available.\n\n(f) If a school exceeds its projected student count in a lottery and a sufficient wait list exists, the school may increase enrollment by adding additional students per grade, not to exceed the total amount of students authorized by the charter.\n\n[33-5206, added 2024, ch. 9, sec. 21, p. 70.]",

      "text": "33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the state department of education.\n\n(2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school according to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public charter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the support units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in cases of state declared emergencies that have been approved by the authorizer as having an impact on public education. Funding from the state educational support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor, plus the salary-based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code. Provided, however, any public charter school that is formed by the conversion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned divisors, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the divisors of the school district in which the traditional public school is located, for each category of pupils listed.\n\n(3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public charter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the school district in which the public charter school is located.\n\n(4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule of the state board of education.\n\n(5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public charter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the department with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of education is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimbursement under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be transported must reside within the public charter school’s primary attendance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:\n\n(a) The student resides within the school district in which the public charter school is physically located; or\n\n(b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reimbursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply to public virtual schools.\n\n(6) Facilities funds.\n\n(a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority of the student’s instruction is received at a physical facility that is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used by the students or employees of the public charter school for educational or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this paragraph, beginning in state fiscal year 2025, \"attending student\" means each student in average daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at such physical charter school facilities where the student is enrolled; except that, upon formal approval by the state board of education, a charter school may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph if the student would have attended a physical facility if not for a stated emergency.\n\n(b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percentage of the school’s enrolled students for which the school receives facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school had the school received facilities funds for all students in average daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"real property\" shall be used as defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter school’s estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation, and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the state department of education may require documentation establishing the need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.\n\n(a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade level to the state department of education by June 1.\n\n(b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportionment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated. Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no later than July 31.\n\n(c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code, relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a discrepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed; and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff indices.\n\n(8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it shall provide the state department of education with written notification of such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of education shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appropriation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on each of the prescribed dates.\n\n(9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its authorizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in the case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of the previous year’s fee. Authorizers shall annually set the authorizer’s fee and in doing so shall document the fees to actual expenditures associated with authorizing.\n\n(10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:\n\n(a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education funding of any source; or\n\n(b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establishment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or organization.\n\n(11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed, whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1) full-time equivalent student.\n\n(12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and distributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in section 33-5203, Idaho Code.\n\n(13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical education essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licensing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements set forth by law.\n\n(14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to public charter schools provided for in this chapter.\n\n[33-5207, added 2024, ch. 9, sec. 23, p. 74; am. 2024, ch. 302, sec. 5, p. 1015.]",

An authorizer may grant renewal with specific written conditions for necessary improvements to a public charter school and a date by which the conditions must be met.\n\n(2) No later than September 1, the authorizer shall issue a public charter school performance report and charter renewal application guidance to any charter holder with a public charter school whose charter will expire the following year. The performance report shall summarize the public charter school’s performance record to date, based on the performance certificate, and shall provide notice of any weaknesses or concerns that may jeopardize renewal, if not timely rectified. The charter holder shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the performance report and submit any corrections or clarifications for the report.\n\n(3) The renewal application guidance shall, at a minimum, provide an opportunity for the charter holder to:\n\n(a) Present additional evidence, beyond the data contained in the performance report, supporting its case for charter renewal; and\n\n(b) Describe improvements undertaken or planned for the school.\n\n(4) The renewal application guidance shall include or refer explicitly to the criteria that will guide the authorizer’s renewal decisions, which shall be based on independent fiscal audits and the performance framework set forth in the performance certificate.\n\n(5) No later than December 15, the charter holder seeking renewal shall submit a renewal application to the authorizer pursuant to the renewal application guidance issued by the authorizer.

Public hearings shall be conducted by the authorizer or such other person or persons appointed by the authorizer to conduct public hearings and receive evidence as a contested case in accordance with the provisions of section 67-5242, Idaho Code. Notice and opportunity to reply shall include, at a minimum, written notice setting out the basis for consideration of revocation, a period of not less than thirty (30) days within which the charter holder can reply in writing, and a public hearing within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the written reply.

      "text": "33-5218. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. (1) Legislative intent. It is the intent of the legislature, in recognition that providing Idaho students with a thorough education is an essential public purpose of the state, to support public charter schools by providing a mechanism to obtain favorable financing on bonds so that less money is obligated toward interest payments and more money remains in public charter schools for the benefit of Idaho’s students. There is hereby created the public charter school facilities program to assist qualifying charter schools in obtaining favorable financing on bonds for facility improvements and construction.\n\n(2) Eligibility. A public charter school seeking to use the public charter school facilities program shall receive approval from the Idaho housing and finance association pursuant to requirements for issuance of nonprofit facility bonds and to satisfaction of the criteria set forth in this section. To qualify, a public charter school shall submit the following documentation to the Idaho housing and finance association:\n\n(a) A letter of commitment from one (1) of the following:\n\n(i) A national or state-chartered financial institution;\n\n(ii) A community development financial institution; or\n\n(iii) A qualified underwriter or an investment firm;\n\n(b) Evidence that the public charter school has been in academic, operational, and financial good standing according to its authorizer for each of the previous three (3) years;\n\n(c) Annual budgets and cash flow statements projecting that the cost to operate the proposed facility, including future debt service, future occupancy cost, and facility operating expenses, will not exceed twenty percent (20%) of ongoing revenues;\n\n(d) Evidence that the school has operating reserves greater than sixty (60) days of cash on hand and a debt service coverage ratio equal to or greater than one and two-tenths (1.2);\n\n(e) An audit opinion or opinions demonstrating:\n\n(i) An unqualified audit opinion, or a qualified opinion qualified only on the basis of not reporting the actuarial value of the PERSI sick leave plan pursuant to statement no. 45 of the governmental accounting standards board;\n\n(ii) An audit devoid of significant findings and conditions, material weakness, or significant internal control weakness; and\n\n(iii) An audit that does not include a going concern disclosure in the notes or an explanatory paragraph within the audit report for three (3) consecutive years;\n\n(f) Certification from a public charter school’s board chair or treasurer that projected future budgets and cash flows are based on reasonable assumptions related to level or increasing projected enrollment or waitlist and projected total income, including any matching funds and donations contingent on receipt of a loan under this section;\n\n(g) Evidence of strong academic results, including above-state average growth or proficiency on the Idaho standards achievement test. A public charter school with enrollment comprised of one hundred percent (100%) at-risk students as defined by section 33-1001(3), Idaho Code, is exempt from this requirement; and\n\n(h) Any additional information requested by the Idaho housing and finance association.\n\n(3) Approval to participate. Upon receipt of documentation satisfying the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this section, the Idaho housing and finance association shall notify the public charter school and the state treasurer that the school has been approved to participate in the public charter school facilities program if:\n\n(a) The public charter school complies with the requirements set forth in subsection (4) of this section; and\n\n(b) The public charter school’s participation would not cause a violation of the limitations set forth in subsection (8) of this section.\n\nAdditional requirements and security interests may be imposed by agreement of the school and bondholder or trustee.\n\n(4) Restricted debt service reserve account.\n\n(a) A school participating in the public charter school facilities program shall agree to have deposited a minimum of twelve (12) months’ payment on principal and interest in a restricted debt service reserve account established and held by the bondholder or trustee.\n\n(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, money in a participating public charter school’s restricted debt service reserve account may not be withdrawn if the amount withdrawn would reduce the level of money in the account to less than twelve (12) months’ payment on principal and interest.\n\n(c) As long as applicable bonds issued under the facilities program remain outstanding, money in a restricted debt service reserve account may be withdrawn in an amount that would reduce the level to less than twelve (12) months’ payment on principal and interest if the money is withdrawn for the purpose of:\n\n(i) Paying the principal, redemption price, or interest on a bond when due if the state payments intercepted pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, plus funded grants and other revenues pledged by the participating public charter school for payment of the bond, are insufficient to make the payment; or\n\n(ii) Paying any redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed prior to maturity if no bonds will remain outstanding.\n\n(5) Intercept. As a requirement to participate in the public charter school facilities program, a participating public charter school shall provide a directive to the Idaho department of education that all payments to the school pursuant to the state educational support program shall be paid directly to the bond trustee to set aside funds in accordance with the bond indenture. All remaining funds shall be forwarded to the public charter school. The payment directive required in this subsection may not be revoked or amended.\n\n(6) Public charter school facilities program fund. There is hereby established in the state treasury the public charter school facilities program fund, which shall consist of moneys made available through appropriations, fees, grants, gifts, or any other source to fulfill the purposes of this section. Moneys in the fund are hereby continuously appropriated for the purposes of this section and shall be expended only for the purposes stated herein. Any interest earned on the investment of idle moneys in the public charter school facilities program fund shall be returned to the public charter school facilities program fund. Schools participating in the public charter school facilities program shall pay a onetime fee in an amount equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of par at the time of issuance and an annual fee in an amount equal to seventy-five thousandths percent (0.075%) on the outstanding balance, which shall be deposited in the public charter school facilities program fund.\n\n(7) Nonpayment.\n\n(a) If a public charter school participating in the public charter school facilities program has defaulted on its obligation to pay, a draw on its restricted debt service reserve account shall be made, then the following shall occur:\n\n(i) The bond trustee shall exercise its remedies under the bond indenture and loan agreement.\n\n(ii) Within ten (10) days following the withdrawal from the restricted debt service account, the bondholder or trustee shall notify the Idaho housing and finance association, the state treasurer, and the state controller of the shortfall in the school’s restricted debt service reserve account.\n\n(iii) Within fifteen (15) days of the notice provided pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the controller shall transfer, from the public charter school facilities program fund set forth in subsection (6) of this section, to the public school income fund and then to the school’s restricted debt service reserve account an amount equal to one (1) month’s interest on the bonds based on the interest payments for which the draw on the restricted debt service reserve account occurred. Moneys transferred to the public school income fund pursuant to this subparagraph shall be continuously appropriated for such purposes.\n\n(iv) By December 1 of each year, the treasurer shall submit to the governor a letter certifying the amount, if any, required to restore amounts on deposit in the restricted debt service reserve accounts of participating public charter schools and the public charter school facilities program fund. The governor shall send to the legislature a statement of the expenditure of moneys from the public charter school facilities program fund as specified in section 8, article IV of the Idaho constitution and report the amount needed to restore funds in the restricted debt service reserve accounts to the amount required in subsection (4)(b) of this section. The legislature may appropriate money to restore amounts on deposit in the restricted debt service reserve account of a defaulting public charter school to the amounts required in subsection (4)(b) of this section or to redeem all outstanding bonds issued for a defaulting public charter school, the source of which may be the public charter school facilities program fund or any other available funds. The legislature may also appropriate money to restore amounts withdrawn from the public charter school facilities program fund.\n\n(b) Repayment. If money has been withdrawn from the public charter school facilities program fund pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection, the school shall repay the fund from the school’s allocation of facilities funds pursuant to section 33-5208(5), Idaho Code, at a time agreed to by the superintendent of public instruction over a period of years until the amount so withdrawn has been repaid to the public charter school facilities program fund, as long as the repayment does not cause an event of default on a facility lease or loan.\n\n(8) Limitations.\n\n(a) Bonds issued for the benefit of public charter schools using the public charter school facilities program shall not be indebtedness of the state, but are special obligations payable solely from:\n\n(i) Revenues or other funds pledged by the qualifying public charter school; and\n\n(ii) Amounts appropriated by the legislature pursuant to subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(b) The Idaho housing and finance association may not use the public charter school facilities program when issuing bonds for a public charter school under the facilities program if the total par amount outstanding under the facilities program as of the proposed closing date of the bonds to be issued, plus the par amount of the bonds to be issued, would cause the maximum aggregate annual debt service of all bonds outstanding under the facilities program to exceed the amount in the public charter school facilities program fund.\n\n(c) Bonds issued under the public charter school facilities program shall not be subordinate to any other obligations used to finance the same project.\n\n[33-5218, added 2019, ch. 291, sec. 1, p. 861; am. 2023, ch. 118, sec. 1, p. 339; am. 2025, ch. 190, sec. 1, p. 884.]",
