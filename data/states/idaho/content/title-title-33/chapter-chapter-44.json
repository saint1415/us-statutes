      "text": "33-4404. PROGRAM PURPOSE. The purpose of the program is to expand employment opportunities for resident students. Employment may be in jobs at accredited institutions of higher education or in approved off-campus jobs. Students with financial need or educational need are to benefit through the program, and to do so while gaining work experience. Accordingly, efforts should be made whenever possible to provide job opportunities to students which relate to their academic and career goals.\n\nFunds under this program may be used to pay up to eighty percent (80%) of earnings in on-campus jobs. Program funds may also be used to pay up to fifty percent (50%) of earnings for approved off-campus jobs where the jobs are directly related to the student’s course of academic study and the employer pays fifty percent (50%) of the earnings. Program funds may also be used to fund up to ten percent (10%) of the total match required for the federal college work study program. Idaho program funds used as match will be governed by federal college work study policy. However, institutional funds used for federal matching purposes shall not be less than the amount allocated for the prior year.\n\n[33-4404, added 1989, ch. 124, sec. 1, p. 274; am. 1990, ch. 95, sec. 3, p. 200.]",

However, the financial aid office may adjust the federal financial need definition for unusual circumstances documented by the financial aid office. All application procedures for need-based programs, as defined by the institution, shall be followed.\n\nRequirements for determination of educational need shall be formulated by each participating institution, subject to review by the state board of education; provided, that such requirements shall include a requirement that the work experience be related to the student’s course of academic study.\n\n[33-4405, added 1989, ch. 124, sec. 1, p. 274; am. 1990, ch. 95, sec. 4, p. 200.]",

Students may be employed either on-campus or off-campus at eligible accredited institutions of higher education, subject to the limitations expressed in this chapter. Employing organizations and agencies must be responsible and must have professional supervision. Discrimination by employers on the bases of sex, race, color, age, religion, national origin, marital status or disability is prohibited.\n\nGenerally, employment which is allowable under the federal college work study program is also allowable under the Idaho program. This applies to both on-campus and off-campus employment, except that off-campus jobs for the program must be within Idaho. Likewise, employment which is not allowable under federal regulations is not eligible under the Idaho program.\n\nOpinions from federal officials as to the legitimacy of a particular job under the federal college work study program may be assumed to be applicable to the Idaho program. However, approval to use Idaho program funds for particular jobs should not be construed as permission to institutions to use federal work-study funds to employ students in such jobs.\n\nThe financial aid office at the institution is responsible for ensuring that disbursements are made only for work performed in accordance with the written job description, with adequate supervision, and with proper documentation for the hours worked.\n\n[33-4407, added 1989, ch. 124, sec. 1, p. 275; am. 1990, ch. 95, sec. 5, p. 201; am. 2010, ch. 235, sec. 17, p. 556.]",
