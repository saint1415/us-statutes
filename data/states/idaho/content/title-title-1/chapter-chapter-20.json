(1) A justice or judge who leaves office or retires from the supreme court, court of appeals or a district court, except a justice or judge retired under the provisions of section 1-2001(4), Idaho Code, may be designated a senior judge of the state of Idaho by the supreme court.\n\n(2) Upon filing with the secretary of state an oath of office as a senior judge as prescribed in subsection (7) of this section, a senior judge is eligible for temporary assignment by the supreme court to a state court as provided in this subsection, whenever the supreme court determines that the assignment is reasonably necessary and will promote the more efficient administration of justice. A senior judge may sit as a district or magistrate judge of the district court of any county or may sit with the supreme court or court of appeals or may perform such other duties pertaining to the judicial department of government as may be requested.\n\n(3) The assignment of a senior judge shall be made by an order which shall designate the court or duties to which the judge is assigned and the duration of the assignment. Promptly after assignment of a senior judge under this section, the supreme court shall cause a certified copy of the order to be sent to the senior judge and another certified copy to the court to which the judge is assigned.\n\n(4) Each senior judge assigned as provided in this section has all the judicial powers and duties, while serving under the assignment, of a regularly qualified judge of the court to which the senior judge is assigned.\n\n(5) A senior judge assigned as provided in this section, other than one performing services required by section 1-2001(2)(b), Idaho Code, shall receive as compensation for each day the senior judge is actually engaged in the performance of duties under the assignment an amount equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the daily salary of the highest office in which the senior judge served. However, a retired judge shall not receive for services as a senior judge during any fiscal year a sum of money which when added to the amount of any judicial retirement pay received by the senior judge for the year exceeds the current annual salary of the highest office in which the senior judge served; except that this limitation shall not apply if the chief justice of the supreme court determines that extended service by one (1) or more senior judges is required because of extraordinary circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a judge’s absence from service due to military service or medical disability. Services by a senior judge under an assignment and receipt of compensation for services shall not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement pay to which the senior judge otherwise would be entitled. Such additional compensation above the retirement compensation benefits accruing to such senior judge shall be paid from the general fund in accordance with appropriations provided by the legislature.\n\n(6) A senior judge assigned to a court located outside the county in which the senior judge regularly resides shall receive, in addition to any daily compensation, reimbursement for traveling and subsistence expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of duties under the assignment. The expenses shall be paid upon presentation of an itemized statement of the expenses, certified by the senior judge to be correct.\n\n(7) To be eligible for assignment, a senior judge must: maintain a residence within the state; comply with all applicable provisions of the Idaho code of judicial conduct; and take, subscribe and file with the secretary of state, the following oath or affirmation:\n\n\"I,……………, do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that as a senior judge of the state of Idaho, I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Idaho, and that upon hereafter accepting any assignment to serve as a judge of a court of this state I will faithfully discharge the duties thereof to the best of my ability.\".\n\n(8) Except as provided in section 1-2001(2)(b), Idaho Code, any period of service rendered by a senior judge shall not in any way be computed for additional retirement benefits, and the state controller shall not receive or deduct any sum for transfer to the judges’ retirement fund or to the public employee retirement system of Idaho.\n\n[1-2005, added 2000, ch. 385, sec. 5, p. 1253; am. 2005, ch. 188, sec. 1, p. 574; am. 2015, ch. 61, sec. 1, p. 169.]",
