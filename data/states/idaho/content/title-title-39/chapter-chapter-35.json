(1) The purpose of a certified family home in Idaho is to provide a homelike alternative to more expensive or more restrictive congregate care or institutional care, designed to allow vulnerable adults to reside in a family-style living environment focused on integrated community living. Certified family homes provide housing and care to vulnerable adults who are elderly, who have mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or physical disabilities, or who are otherwise unable to live alone without personal assistance and whose mental, emotional, and physical condition can be met by the care provider. The legislature supports the capabilities of individuals receiving services in certified family homes to direct their own care. The care provider must obtain a waiver to house and care for two (2) persons requiring care at a nursing facility as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) The certified family home shall be operated by a care provider who has demonstrated the knowledge and experience required to provide safe and appropriate services to each resident of the certified family home. The care provider shall ensure an objective, individualized assessment is conducted to determine resident needs and shall develop a comprehensive, negotiated plan of service describing how to meet those needs. The care provider shall ensure delivery of appropriate services to meet resident needs as described in the plan of service and shall ensure resident rights are honored and protected.\n\n(3) The department is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. This responsibility includes but is not limited to monitoring the condition of the certified family home, ensuring that each resident has an individualized written plan of service, and managing enforcement procedures when violations occur.\n\n[39-3501, added 2024, ch. 63, sec. 2, p. 311; am. 2025, ch. 122, sec. 33, p. 639.]",
