For purposes of sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code:\n\n(1) The legislature recognizes the established common law and the fundamental right of competent persons to control the decisions relating to the rendering of their health care, including the decision to have artificial life-sustaining treatment withheld or withdrawn. The legislature further finds that modern medical technology has made possible the artificial prolongation of human life beyond natural limits. The legislature further finds that persons are sometimes unable to express their desire to withhold or withdraw such artificial life-sustaining treatment that provides nothing medically necessary or beneficial to the person because of the person’s inability to communicate with the attending licensed independent practitioner.\n\n(2) In recognition of the dignity and privacy that persons have a right to expect, the legislature hereby declares that the laws of this state shall recognize the right of a competent person to have his or her wishes for health care services and for the withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining treatment carried out even though that person is no longer able to communicate with the attending licensed independent practitioner.\n\n(3) It is the intent of the legislature to establish an effective means for such communication. It is not the intent of the legislature that the procedures described in sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, are the only effective means of such communication, and nothing in sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, shall impair or supersede any legal right or legal responsibility that a person may have to effect the withholding or withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining treatment in any lawful manner, provided that this sentence shall not be construed to authorize any violation of section 39-4514(3), Idaho Code.

This chapter does not make legal, and in no way condones, euthanasia, mercy killing, or assisted suicide or permit an affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life, including any act or omission described in section 18-4017, Idaho Code, other than to allow the natural process of dying.\n\n(3) Withdrawal of care. Assisted feeding or artificial nutrition and hydration may not be withdrawn or denied if its provision is directed by a competent patient in accordance with section 39-4503, Idaho Code, by a patient’s advance care planning document under section 39-4510, Idaho Code, or by a patient’s surrogate decision-maker in accordance with section 39-4504, Idaho Code. Health care services necessary to sustain life or to provide appropriate comfort for a patient other than assisted feeding or artificial nutrition and hydration may not be withdrawn or denied if its provision is directed by a competent patient in accordance with section 39-4503, Idaho Code, by a patient’s advance care planning document under section 39-4510, Idaho Code, or by a patient’s surrogate decision-maker in accordance with section 39-4504, Idaho Code, unless such care would be nonbeneficial medical treatment. Except as specifically provided in chapters 3 and 4, title 66, Idaho Code, health care services, assisted feeding, or artificial nutrition and hydration, the denial of which is directed by a competent patient in accordance with section 39-4503, Idaho Code, by a patient’s advance care planning document under section 39-4510, Idaho Code, or by a patient’s surrogate decision-maker in accordance with section 39-4504, Idaho Code, shall be withdrawn and denied in accordance with a valid advance care planning document.\n\n(4) Comfort care.

Any advance care planning document that contained the elements set forth in this chapter at the time of execution shall be deemed to be in compliance with this chapter. This section shall be liberally construed to give the effect to any authentic expression of the person’s prior wishes or directives concerning health care services.\n\n(8) Insurance.\n\n(a) The making of an advance care planning document or a DNR order pursuant to this chapter shall not restrict, inhibit, or impair in any manner the sale, procurement, or issuance of any policy of life insurance, nor shall it be deemed to modify the terms of an existing policy of life insurance. No policy of life insurance shall be legally impaired or invalidated in any manner by the withholding or withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining treatment from an insured person, notwithstanding any term of the policy to the contrary.\n\n(b) No licensed independent practitioner, health care facility, or other health care provider and no health care service plan, insurer issuing disability insurance, self-insured employee plan, welfare benefit plan, or nonprofit hospital service plan shall require any person to execute an advance care planning document or a DNR order as a condition for being insured for, or receiving, health care services.\n\n(9) Portability and copies.\n\n(a) A POST form that meets the requirements of section 39-4512A, Idaho Code, shall be transferred with the person to, and be effective in, all care settings including but not limited to home care, ambulance or other transport, hospital, residential care facility, and hospice care. The POST form shall remain in effect until such time as there is a valid revocation or suspension pursuant to section 39-4511A, Idaho Code, or new orders are issued by a licensed independent practitioner.\n\n(b) A photostatic, facsimile, or electronic copy of a valid POST form may be treated as an original by a licensed independent practitioner or other health care provider.\n\n(10) Registration. An advance care planning document or the revocation or replacement of an advance care planning document meeting the requirements of this chapter may be registered with the department of health and welfare pursuant to section 39-4515, Idaho Code.

Entry of a document into the health care directive registry pursuant to this section does not create a presumption favoring the validity of the document.\n\n(4) The department of health and welfare shall delete an advance care planning document and the informational registration form from the health care directive registry when the department of health and welfare receives:\n\n(a) Written notification to remove an advance care planning document signed by the maker thereof or that person’s surrogate decision-maker; or\n\n(b) Verification from the bureau of vital records and health statistics of the department of health and welfare that the person who executed the advance care planning document is deceased.

Such notification must be provided both orally and in writing to at least one (1) parent or legal guardian of the unemancipated minor patient unless, in the licensed independent practitioner’s reasonable medical judgment, the urgency of the decision requires reliance on only providing the information orally. Such notification must also include informing the parent or legal guardian of the forty-eight (48) hour provision in subsection (5) of this section. Unless the parent or legal guardian agrees with the implementation of the following orders, an order not to resuscitate, an order to withhold artificial life-sustaining treatment, an order to withhold artificial nutrition and hydration, or a similar licensed independent practitioner’s order shall not be instituted, either orally or in writing, until at least forty-eight (48) hours after oral and written notice have been provided to at least one (1) parent or legal guardian in accordance with this section.
