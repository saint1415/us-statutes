      "text": "39-5501. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. (1) Public health officials have concluded that secondhand tobacco smoke causes disease, including lung cancer and heart disease, in nonsmoking adults, as well as causes serious conditions in children such as asthma, respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. In addition, public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke can exacerbate adult asthma and allergies and cause eye, throat and nasal irritation. The conclusions of public health officials concerning secondhand tobacco smoke are sufficient to warrant measures that regulate smoking in public places in order to protect the public health and the health of employees who work at public places.\n\n(2) The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, comfort and environment, the health of employees who work at public places and the rights of nonsmokers to breathe clean air by prohibiting smoking in public places and at public meetings.\n\n[39-5501, added 1985, ch. 60, sec. 1, p. 120; am. 2004, ch. 389, sec. 1, p. 1166.]",
