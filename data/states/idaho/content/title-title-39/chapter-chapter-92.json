      "text": "39-9202. PUBLIC POLICY. It is the policy of the state of Idaho to promote personal responsibility for health care and the cost-effective delivery of medical services by encouraging innovative use of direct patient-provider practices for primary medical care. Direct patient-provider practices utilize a model of periodic fees for provider access and medical management over time, rather than simply a fee for visit or procedure service model. Some patients and individual primary care providers may wish to establish direct agreements with one another as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service care financed through health insurance. The purpose of this act is to confirm that direct patient-provider agreements that satisfy the provisions of this chapter do not constitute insurance.\n\n[39-9202, added 2015, ch. 291, sec. 1, p. 1164.]",
