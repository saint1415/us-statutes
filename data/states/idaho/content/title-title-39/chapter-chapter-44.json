      "text": "39-4404. CONSISTENCY WITH FEDERAL LAW. The legislature intends that the state of Idaho enact and carry out a hazardous waste program that will enable the state to assume primacy over hazardous waste control from the federal government.\n\nThe legislature finds that the RCRA, as amended, 42 U.S.C., section 6901 et seq., and federal regulations adopted pursuant thereto, establish complex and detailed provisions for regulation of those who generate, transport, treat, store, and dispose of hazardous wastes. The legislature cannot conveniently or advantageously set forth in this chapter all the requirements of all of the regulations which have been or will be established under RCRA. However, by the provisions of this chapter, the legislature desires to avoid the existence of duplicative, overlapping or conflicting state and federal regulatory systems.\n\nTherefore, the board is directed to promulgate rules which are consistent with RCRA and the federal regulations adopted by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency to implement RCRA. Farmers and ranchers who treat, store, or dispose of waste pesticides from their operations on lands owned or controlled by them shall not be required by board rules to do anything more than follow the instructions on the pesticide label and triple rinse empty containers in accordance with the RCRA regulations of the environmental protection agency. The board may not promulgate any rule that would impose conditions or requirements more stringent or broader in scope than RCRA and the RCRA regulations of the environmental protection agency. The board may, however, promulgate procedural rules and rules specifically authorized by this chapter or other state statutes without showing that those rules are required by RCRA or the regulations of the environmental protection agency; provided that those rules shall not conflict with this section, other sections of this chapter, RCRA, or the regulations of the environmental protection agency. Any rule promulgated by the board shall be valid until it is repealed or modified through the administrative process of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n[39-4404, added 1983, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 419; am. 1986, ch. 182, sec. 1, p. 479; am. 1988, ch. 6, sec. 1, p. 6; am. 1988, ch. 259, sec. 1, p. 498; am. 1993, ch. 216, sec. 27, p. 608; am. 1993, ch. 291, sec. 2, p. 1085.]",

(1) No person shall construct, operate, or modify a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility or site without a permit from the department. The owner or operator of the facility or site rather than the builder shall be responsible for obtaining the permit. Permits may contain such conditions necessary to protect human health and environment. The board may exempt classes or categories of hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities from the permit requirement if the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with RCRA requirements. The fact that a class or category of such facilities is not required to obtain a federal permit shall be persuasive evidence that an exemption is in the public interest.\n\n(2) Interim status granted by RCRA or a permit issued by the United States environmental protection agency prior to the date that the state program is authorized by the administrator of that agency shall be adopted by the department as a state granted interim status or as a state granted permit until the department issues a new state permit. The board may adopt such rules and regulations as necessary to:\n\n(a) Allow other facilities to qualify for interim status;\n\n(b) Require existing interim status surface impoundments, new units, replacement of existing units and lateral expansions of existing interim status facilities to comply with all regulations which apply to new facilities; and\n\n(c) Provide for the termination of interim status.\n\n(3) The board shall promulgate rules and regulations establishing the terms and conditions for issuing permits to the described facilities and sites. The rules and regulations shall provide for, but not be limited to:\n\n(a) Standards and procedures for the safe operation and maintenance of the facilities and sites;\n\n(b) Education and training qualifications of personnel at the facilities and sites;\n\n(c) Contractual commitment or consent to each facility or site from all holders of interests in the real property committed to that facility or site;\n\n(d) Monetary assurances in such form and amount as are necessary for effective management, maintenance, and monitoring of the facilities and sites during and after operation;\n\n(e) Evidence of financial responsibility for corrective action on-site and off-site;\n\n(f) Liability insurance in such form and amount as is necessary to compensate for potential damages caused by the facilities and sites; provided, that liability insurance shall not be required in the event that liability insurance is not required by the federal regulations adopted pursuant to the RCRA;\n\n(g) Emergency equipment and emergency response plans appropriate to the facilities and sites;\n\n(h) Public participation in the permitting process consistent with 42 U.S.C. section 6974(b).\n\n(4) Permits shall be issued for a period not to exceed ten (10) years or the maximum period allowed under RCRA, whichever is greater. However, permits may be reviewed at least every five (5) years and modified as necessary to take into account changes in this chapter or regulations promulgated pursuant to it and improvements in technology. Permits issued to hazardous waste facilities and sites by the department prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be reissued to conform with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations promulgated under this chapter.\n\n(5) Any permit issued after the effective date of this provision shall require corrective action to be taken on-site and off-site for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents, from any solid waste management unit at the treatment, storage, or disposal facility seeking the permit, regardless of the time when the waste was placed in such unit. Permits issued from November 8, 1985, until the effective date of this provision shall be reissued to conform with this provision.\n\n(6) Any permit issued under this section may be revoked by the director pursuant to the provisions of section 39-4413, Idaho Code, if the permitted party fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit, this chapter, or the rules and regulations promulgated under this chapter.\n\n(7) The department may issue a variance from the requirements of the rules and regulations promulgated under this section, if, in the judgment of the director, application of the requirements would cause unreasonable hardship and the granting of a variance would not be harmful to the public interest or inconsistent with RCRA requirements. A variance shall not exceed one (1) year in duration and may be renewed or extended only after the department provides public notice and an opportunity for public comment.\n\n(8) (a) The director of the department may issue a research, development and demonstration permit for any hazardous waste treatment technology or process for which permit standards for such experimental activity have not been promulgated. Any such permit shall include such terms and conditions as will assure protection of human health and the environment. Such permits shall:\n\n1. Provide for the construction of such facilities, as necessary, and for operation of the facility for not longer than one (1) year (unless renewed as provided below); and\n\n2. Provide for the receipt and treatment by the facility of only those types and quantities of hazardous waste which the director deems necessary for purposes of determining the efficiency and performance capabilities of the technology or process and the effects of such technology or process on human health and the environment; and\n\n3. Include such requirements as the director deems necessary to protect human health and the environment (including, but not limited to, requirements regarding monitoring, operation, insurance or bonding, financial responsibility, closure, and remedial action); and\n\n4. Include such requirements as the director deems necessary regarding testing and providing of information to the director with respect to the operation of the facility.\n\n(b) The director may apply the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection in establishing the conditions of each permit without separate establishment of regulations implementing such criteria.\n\n(c) For the purpose of expediting review and issuance of permits under this subsection, the director may, consistent with the protection of human health and the environment, modify or waive permit application and permit issuance requirements established in the general permit regulations except that there may be no modification or waiver of regulations regarding financial responsibility (including insurance) or of applicable public participation procedures.\n\n(d) The director may renew a research, development and demonstration permit which has been issued pursuant to this subsection. The renewal term shall be no longer than one (1) year. A permit shall not be renewed more than three (3) times.\n\n[39-4409, added 1983, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 421; am. 1986, ch. 148, sec. 4, p. 419; am. 1987, ch. 102, sec. 1, p. 204; am. 1988, ch. 7, sec. 1, p. 7; am. 1988, ch. 259, sec. 2, p. 499.]",

(1) All inspections and searches conducted under the authority of this chapter shall be performed in conformity with the prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures contained in the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States and article I, section 17, of the constitution of the state of Idaho. The state shall not, under the authority granted by this chapter, conduct warrantless administrative searches of private property in the absence of either consent from the property owner or occupier or exigent circumstances such as a public health or environmental emergency.\n\n(2) For the purposes of developing or enforcing any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation authorized by this chapter, any duly authorized state employee or representative may, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, at any reasonable time:\n\n(a) Enter upon any private or public property where hazardous wastes are or have been generated, transported, treated, stored, or disposed of to inspect and to secure samples of such wastes, their containers, and their labels;\n\n(b) Enter into any aircraft, vehicle, vessel, rail car, trailer, van, or other means of conveyance where hazardous wastes are or have been contained to inspect and to secure samples of such wastes, their containers, and their labels;\n\n(c) Enter any private or public property, or means of conveyance, where records, reports, information or test results relating to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous wastes exist to inspect and copy such documents.\n\n(3) Upon request by an authorized agent of a property owner or facility operator, the department shall provide the property owner or facility operator with a receipt for samples taken and a copy of sample analysis.

The right of entry of a duly authorized state or health district employee shall not be subject to any confidentiality requirements other than those specified in section 39-4411(3), Idaho Code, and chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code.

      "text": "39-4413. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES. (A) Whenever the director determines that any person is in violation of any provision of this chapter or any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, compliance agreement or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter, one or more of the following actions may be taken:\n\n(1) ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.\n\n(a) Notice. The director may commence an administrative enforcement action by issuing a written notice of violation. The notice of violation shall identify the alleged violation with specificity, shall specify each provision of the act, rule, regulation, permit or order which has been violated, and shall state the amount of civil penalty claimed for each violation. The notice of violation shall inform the person to whom it is directed of an opportunity to confer with the director or the director’s designee in a compliance conference concerning the alleged violation. A written response may be required within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice of violation by the person to whom it is directed.\n\n(b) Scheduling Compliance Conference. If a recipient of a notice of violation contacts the department within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of notice, the recipient shall be entitled to a compliance conference. The conference shall be held within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt of notice, unless a later date is agreed upon between the parties. If a compliance conference is not requested, the director may proceed with a civil enforcement action as provided in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(c) Compliance Conference. The compliance conference shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of violation to explain the circumstances of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for remedying damage caused by the alleged violation and for assuring future compliance. If the recipient and the director agree on a plan to remedy damage caused by the alleged violation and to assure future compliance, they may enter into a consent order formalizing their agreement. The consent order may include a provision for payment of any agreed civil penalty.\n\n(d) Effect of Consent Order. A consent order shall be effective immediately upon signing by both parties and shall preclude any civil enforcement action for the same alleged violation. If a party does not comply with the terms of the consent order, the director may seek and obtain in any appropriate district court specific performance of the consent order and such other relief as authorized in this chapter.\n\n(e) Failure to Reach Agreement on Consent Order. If the parties cannot reach agreement on a consent order within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the notice of violation, or if the recipient does not request a compliance conference pursuant to subsection (A)(1)(b) of this section, the director may commence and prosecute a civil enforcement action in district court, in accordance with subsection (A)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) PERMIT SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS.\n\n(a) Grounds. The director may revoke or temporarily suspend the permit of any hazardous waste facility or site pursuant to the grounds provided in subsection (6) of section 39-4409, Idaho Code.\n\nA violation that is shown to have occurred as the result of an unforeseeable act of God despite a permitted party’s reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable legal requirements shall not be grounds for a suspension or revocation.\n\n(b) Notice of Hearing. The director shall commence a permit suspension or revocation action by giving a permitted party a written notice of intent to suspend or revoke. The notice shall inform the permitted party of facts or conduct which warrant suspension or revocation of the permit. The notice, hearing, and record requirements for contested cases contained in the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, and subsection (A)(2)(c) of this section shall apply to proceedings initiated under this subsection. Revocation or suspension of a permit shall become final fifteen (15) days after delivery of the notice of intent to revoke or suspend unless the permitted party requests a hearing.\n\n(c) Administrative Hearing Provisions.\n\n(i) Upon a timely request by a permit holder for a hearing to review the director’s action under subsection (A)(2)(b) of this section, the director shall promptly conduct a hearing open to the public. The contested case provisions of the Idaho administrative procedure act shall apply to all hearings conducted under this subsection.\n\n(ii) The director shall have the authority to request from the district court in and for Ada county or any other appropriate district court the issuance of an order in the nature of a subpoena compelling the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production before the director of papers, books, drawings, documents, test results, and other evidence relevant to a permit suspension or revocation investigation or adjudication.\n\n(iii) After the hearing, the director shall issue a written opinion setting forth findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order. An aggrieved person subject to the director’s order may seek its review as a final order in a district court as provided by the Idaho administrative procedure act. District court review of the director’s decision shall be limited to the record developed before the director.\n\n(3) CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION. The attorney general may commence and prosecute in district court a civil enforcement action. Civil enforcement actions shall be commenced and prosecuted in the district court in and for the county in which the alleged violation occurred, and may be brought against any person who is alleged to have violated any provision of this chapter or any rule, regulation, permit, condition, requirement, consent order, or order which has become effective pursuant to this chapter. Such action may be brought to compel compliance with any provision of this chapter or with any rule, regulation, permit or order promulgated hereunder, and for any relief or remedies authorized in this chapter. The director shall not be required to initiate or prosecute an administrative action before the attorney general may commence and prosecute a civil enforcement action. In addition, the attorney general may delegate this authority regarding civil enforcement actions to the prosecuting attorney of the county where a civil enforcement action may arise.\n\n(B) ACTIONS AGAINST GUARANTORS. If the owner or operator is in bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code, or where jurisdiction cannot be obtained over an owner or operator likely to be solvent at the time of judgment, an action may be brought directly against a guarantor of financial responsibility by the state or any injured party for any claim arising from conduct for which guarantees of financial responsibility have been made. The guarantor may invoke all rights and defenses which would have been available to the owner or operator and all rights and defenses normally available to the guarantor.\n\n(C) LIMITATION OF ACTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL COURT PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER. No civil or administrative proceeding may be brought to recover for a violation of this chapter or any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter more than two (2) years after the director had knowledge or ought reasonably to have had knowledge of the violation.\n\n[39-4413, added 1983, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 425; am. 1986, ch. 148, sec. 6, p. 422; am. 1988, ch. 259, sec. 3, p. 501; am. 1989, ch. 38, sec. 1, p. 49.]",

The remedies specified in this section are cumulative and nonexclusive.\n\n(1) MONETARY PENALTIES.\n\n(a) Any person who makes a false statement or representation in any application, label, manifest, record, report, permit or other document filed, maintained, or used for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each separate violation or for each day of a continuing violation.\n\n(b) Any person who violates this chapter or any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, compliance agreement, or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each separate violation or for each day of a continuing violation.\n\n(c) The imposition or computation of monetary penalties may take into account the seriousness of the violation, good faith efforts to comply with the law, and an enforceable commitment by the person against whom the penalty is directed to implement a supplemental environmental project. For purposes of this section, \"supplemental environmental project\" means a project which the person is not otherwise required to perform and which prevents pollution, reduces the amount of pollutants reaching the environment, contributes to public awareness of environmental matters, or enhances the quality of the environment. In evaluating a particular supplemental environmental project proposal, preference may be given to those projects with an environmental benefit, which relates to the violation or the objectives of the underlying statute which was violated, or which enhances the quality of the environment in the general geographic location where the violation occurred.\n\n(2) ASSESSMENT OF COSTS. Any person who violates this chapter or any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, compliance agreement, or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter may be assessed for:\n\n(a) The state’s costs for any nonroutine investigations, inspections, monitoring, or surveys which lead to evidence of the violation;\n\n(b) The state’s costs, including the reasonable value of attorneys’ services, for preparing and litigating the case;\n\n(c) The state’s costs for mitigating, removing, correcting or terminating adverse effects upon soil, air, or water quality resulting from the violation;\n\n(d) The state’s costs for impounding, storing, and disposing of contaminated property;\n\n(e) Compensation for damages to publicly held resources including but not limited to, land, water, recreational uses, wildlife, fish and aquatic life to restore the resource to its highest previous use;\n\n(f) Compensation for damages to privately held resources including, but not limited to, livestock, land, water, or other personal property, and compensation for court costs allowed by statute, reasonable attorney’s fees for trial preparation and trial of the case, and all other reasonable costs of trial preparation and trial of the case;\n\n(g) Compensation for damages to personal health and compensation for court costs allowed by statute, reasonable attorney’s fees for trial preparation and trial of the case, and all other reasonable costs of trial preparation and trial of the case;\n\n(h) The imposition or computation of costs may take into account the seriousness of the violation and good faith efforts to comply with the law.\n\n(3) RESTRAINING ORDERS, INJUNCTIONS AND OTHER RELIEF.\n\n(a) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, compliance agreement, or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other relief deemed appropriate. Upon a showing to the court that a violation is causing an imminent hazard to the public health, the public safety, or to the environment, the department need not allege or prove at any stage of the proceeding that long-term irreparable damage will occur should the injunction or order not be issued or that the remedy at law is inadequate.\n\n(b) A receiver may be appointed to oversee or operate any hazardous waste facility or site which is established or operated in violation of this chapter or any standard, regulation, condition, requirement, compliance agreement, or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(4) PAYMENT TO HAZARDOUS WASTE EMERGENCY ACCOUNT. All moneys collected by the department pursuant to subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section to resolve any enforcement proceeding instituted under section 39-4413, Idaho Code, shall be paid into the hazardous waste emergency account created by section 39-4417, Idaho Code.\n\n[39-4414, added 1983, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 427; am. 1984, ch. 157, sec. 1, p. 383; am. 1997, ch. 94, sec. 1, p. 219.]",

In issuing the variance, the director shall take into account:\n\n(a) The long-term uncertainties associated with land disposal;\n\n(b) The goal of managing hazardous waste in an appropriate manner in the first instance; and\n\n(c) The persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous wastes and their hazardous constituents.\n\n(3) (a) The board shall promulgate rules and regulations specifying those levels or methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized.\n\n(b) If such restricted hazardous waste has been treated to the level or by a method specified in regulations promulgated under this subsection, such waste or residue thereof shall not be subject to the prohibition in subsection (1) of this section and may be disposed of in a land disposal facility which meets the requirements of this chapter.\n\n[39-4423, added 1986, ch. 324, sec. 2, p. 797.]",
