      "text": "39-1201. POLICY. It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state to insure that children of this state shall receive adequate substitute parental care in the event of absence, temporary or permanent inability of parents to provide care and protection for their children or the parents are seeking alternative twenty-four (24) hour long-term care for their children. This policy is predicated upon the fact that children are vulnerable, not capable of protecting themselves, and when their parents for any reason have relinquished their care to others, there arises the possibility of certain risks to the children’s lives, health and safety which the community as a whole must protect against. This requires the offsetting statutory protection of review and, in certain instances, licensing or registration.\n\nThe provisions of this chapter shall apply only to those entities specifically addressed herein. It is not the intent of the legislature to restrict, regulate, or otherwise control private day schools or home schools.\n\n[(39-1201) 1963, ch. 320, sec. 1, p. 901; am. and redesignated 1990, ch. 215, sec. 2, p. 569.]",
