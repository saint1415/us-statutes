      "text": "39-501. PURPOSE. The protection of ground water quality is essential for life, health and furthering matters of commerce. Multiple public agencies have regulatory jurisdiction over various aspects of everyday human activity that can and do pose risks to vital underground water supplies. Enforcement of current rules and regulations, implementation of educational programs, and inspection of potential sources of pollution require funding beyond the budgets of agencies charged with these responsibilities. The coordination of work by public agencies to assist in the prevention of degradation of valuable ground water can be a cost-effective alternative to after the fact remediation of a degraded resource. Certain ground water quality problems cannot be remedied, only prevented. The purposes of establishing an aquifer protection district include protection of the state’s economy, maintaining a water supply that does not require extensive treatment prior to human consumption or commercial use, avoiding the economic costs of remedial action, and protecting the well-being of communities that depend upon aquifers for essential human needs.\n\n[39-501, added 2006, ch. 304, sec. 1, p. 937.]",

(1) In counties where a state designated sensitive resource aquifer has been declared as prescribed by rules of the department of environmental quality, and such designation was made prior to the enactment of this act, the board of county commissioners of any such county may, upon petition, hold an election for establishment of, or participation in, an aquifer protection district as authorized by this chapter.\n\n(2) A multicounty aquifer protection district may be established by a joint powers agreement as authorized by chapter 23, title 67, Idaho Code, provided all participating counties have held elections and voted in favor of establishment of, or participation in, an aquifer protection district. Every reference to a county in this chapter may be applicable to the multiple counties that participate in a multicounty aquifer protection district.\n\n(3) An aquifer protection district is a political subdivision of the state of Idaho subordinate to the county or counties in which it is formed. The governing board of an aquifer protection district is authorized to provide coordination and funding for aquifer protection activities carried out by county government, other political subdivisions, state agencies, and private individuals or interests. The boundaries of an aquifer protection district shall conform as nearly as practicable to boundaries of the subject aquifer, the aquifer’s recharge areas, and areas that may be dependent upon the aquifer as a source of water.\n\n[39-503, added 2006, ch. 304, sec. 1, p. 938.]",

      "text": "39-504. PETITIONS — ELECTIONS — MODIFICATION — DISSOLUTION — AUTHORITY. (1) The establishment of, or participation in, an aquifer protection district may be initiated by the filing of a petition signed by not fewer than fifty (50) qualified electors of any county in which an eligible aquifer is located and who reside within the boundaries of the proposed aquifer protection district. The petition shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the signers of the petition are resident. The petition shall designate the proposed boundaries of the aquifer protection district.\n\n(2) Upon the filing of the petition, the county clerk shall promptly examine the petition and certify whether the required number of qualified petitioners have signed the petition. If the number of petition signers is sufficient, the county clerk shall transmit the certified petition to the board of county commissioners.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of a duly certified petition the board of county commissioners shall give notice of an election to be held, which election shall be held at the same time as the primary or general election, in such proposed district for the purpose of determining whether or not the proposed district shall be established or whether or not the county shall participate in a district. Such notice shall include the date and hours of the election, the polling places, the general purposes of the proposed district, a description of lands to be included in the proposed district, and a statement that a map of the proposed district is available in the office of the board of county commissioners. The notice shall be published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks prior to such election in a newspaper of general circulation within the county.\n\n(4) The election shall be held and conducted consistent with the provisions of chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code. The board of county commissioners shall appoint three (3) judges of election, one (1) of whom shall act as clerk for the election. At such election the electors shall vote for or against the establishment of, or participation in, the district.\n\n(5) The judges of election shall certify the returns of the election to the board of county commissioners. If a majority of the votes cast at said election are in favor of the establishment of, or participation in, the district, the board of county commissioners shall declare the district established and give it a name by which, in all proceedings, it shall thereafter be known.\n\n(6) Procedures for boundary modification or dissolution of a district created pursuant to this section shall be in substantial compliance with the provisions for petition and election provided in this section.\n\n(7) In the event a board of county commissioners declares a district established pursuant to the procedures prescribed by this section, the district shall be recognized as a legally established political subdivision of the state of Idaho. Unless otherwise limited by law, districts are authorized to work with and across the boundaries of all political subdivisions of the state of Idaho that are wholly or partially located within the external boundaries of the established aquifer protection district. Providing protection of a state-designated sensitive resource aquifer is a governmental function.\n\n[39-504, added 2006, ch. 304, sec. 1, p. 938.]",
