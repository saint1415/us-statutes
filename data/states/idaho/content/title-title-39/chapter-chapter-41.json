A county may be deemed eligible to perform plan review services only for those types of installations for which they have authority pursuant to this chapter and chapter 50, title 54, Idaho Code, to adopt an enforcement program. Where an eligible county performs the plan review services, the electrical and plumbing code plan reviews shall be performed by the division at the hourly rate as established in rule by the division. Any local government elected to perform plan review services for public schools shall provide the division a copy of all approved plans.\n\n(d) Wherein the proposed work is valued in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a school district may elect to utilize the school plan review services available from an eligible local government building code enforcement jurisdiction or from the division. Wherein the proposed work is valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or less, a school district may elect to use a local government without regard to the eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Election by a school district shall be made by submitting a written certification to both the division and the involved local government.\n\n(e) Public school plan review services provided by either the division or an eligible local jurisdiction pursuant to this section shall include a review of the following disciplines: building (structural and nonstructural), mechanical, fuel gas, plumbing, electrical, accessibility, elevators, boilers, and energy conservation.

The division will review the plans submitted to it pursuant to this section for compliance with the current editions of the codes specified in this chapter or within rules promulgated pursuant to this chapter by the board and by section 39-8006, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) Public school building plans must be approved by either the local government or the division before the school district may advertise for bids. Once plans are reviewed and approved pursuant to this section, no material change can be made to such plans without review and approval of such change by the jurisdiction performing the plan review. All school construction or remodeling governed by this chapter shall be inspected by building inspectors certified in accordance with section 39-4108, Idaho Code, or by Idaho-licensed architects or engineers to determine compliance with this chapter and the Idaho uniform school building safety act, chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of local governments to issue building permits, perform fire code or other zoning and land use-related plan reviews or provide a full range of building code enforcement activities as they relate to inspections of school buildings or facilities sited within their jurisdiction regardless of the election exercised by the school district pursuant to this section.\n\n[39-4113, added 1975, ch. 180, sec. 2, p. 486; am. 1978, ch. 160, sec. 2, p. 348; am. 1983, ch. 153, sec. 10, p. 414; am. 1988, ch. 264, sec. 17, p. 532; am. 1990, ch. 155, sec. 2, p. 341; am. 1990, ch. 167, sec. 1, p. 364; am. 1995, ch. 267, sec. 13, p. 863; am. 1996, ch. 2, sec. 1, p. 4; am. 2000, ch. 352, sec. 2, p. 1186; am. 2002, ch. 345, sec. 17, p. 972; am. 2009, ch. 219, sec. 1, p. 681; am. 2010, ch. 174, sec. 1, p. 357; am. 2015, ch. 110, sec. 10, p. 277; am. 2023, ch. 15, sec. 12, p. 81.]",
