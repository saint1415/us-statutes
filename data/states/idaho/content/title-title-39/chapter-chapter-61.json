      "text": "39-6102. PURPOSE. Under this chapter, rural and underserved communities in Idaho would be able to apply for the placement of a foreign trained physician after demonstrating that they are unable to recruit an American physician and all other recruitment/placement possibilities have proven to be inaccessible.\n\n(1) The \"Idaho Conrad J-1 Visa Waiver Program\" authorizes the Idaho department of health and welfare to recommend up to thirty (30) foreign trained physicians per federal fiscal year to locate in communities that are federally designated as having a health workforce shortage. Recommendations may be for pediatrics, internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry, general surgery, or physician specialists. Applications for specialists must demonstrate a need for the type of specialty held by the petitioning physician. Final approval of J-1 visa waiver requests are made by the United States bureau of citizenship and immigration services.\n\n(2) Provided health care organizations located in federally designated shortage areas do not utilize the full annual allocation of J-1 visa waivers, the department may accept waiver applications six (6) months after the beginning of each federal fiscal year for petitioning J-1 visa waiver physicians to work in areas without a federal shortage area designation. The practice and petitioning physician must serve patients who reside in federally designated areas of underservice.\n\n(3) The \"National Interest Waiver Program\" allows the Idaho department of health and welfare to testify that it is in the public’s interest that a waiver be granted to a foreign trained physician who commits to locating in a community that is federally determined as having a health workforce shortage. Final approval of the national interest waiver request is made by the United States bureau of citizenship and immigration services.\n\n[39-6102, added 2004, ch. 128, sec. 1, p. 437; am. 2009, ch. 106, sec. 3, p. 326; am. 2017, ch. 72, sec. 1, p. 171; am. 2023, ch. 31, sec. 1, p. 150.]",

The department may only submit a waiver request when:\n\n(a) The application contains all of the required information and documentation;\n\n(b) The application meets all state and federal criteria;\n\n(c) Foreign exchange physicians having a J-1 case number assigned by the United States department of state have paid all federal processing fees; and\n\n(d) The applicant has paid the state of Idaho application processing fee.\n\n(2) Limitations of department actions.\n\n(a) Prior to submission of an application, the department may provide information to the applicant on preparing a complete application.\n\n(b) The department will not be responsible for adding any information to incomplete application packets.\n\n(c) For applicants who have benefited from department waiver requests previously, the applicant’s history of compliance will be a consideration in future decisions for waiver requests.\n\n(d) In any single program year, a health care facility will not be allotted more than five (5) J-1 visa waiver request applications per practice location.\n\n(e) The shortage area designation must be current on the date the United States department of state reviews and recommends the application and on the date the immigration agency approves the J-1 visa waiver and national interest waiver. Any application that is being submitted to the department at the end of the three (3) year health professional shortage area designation cycle may be summarily denied if the renewal is not obtained.\n\n(i) Participation by the department in the J-1 visa waiver program and in the national interest waiver program is completely discretionary and voluntary. The department may elect not to participate in the program at any time. The submission of a complete waiver application package does not ensure the department will recommend a waiver. The department reserves the right to recommend or decline any request for a waiver.\n\n(ii) The department, its employees or agents are held harmless of any perceived consequence for the denial of a waiver petitioner or the approved placement of one that is not favorable.\n\n(iii) Application procedures for J-1 visa waiver physician placements were developed by the department in compliance with P.L. 103-416 and subsequent revisions. The procedures for the issuance of national interest waiver recommendations were developed by the department in compliance with 8 CFR 214.12 and 8 CFR 245 and subsequent revisions. These procedures are subject to updates and changes at any time. Interpretation of these procedures rests solely with the department in consultation with the appropriate federal agencies.\n\n[39-6106, added 2004, ch. 128, sec. 1, p. 439; am. 2009, ch. 106, sec. 6, p. 327; am. 2017, ch. 72, sec. 3, p. 173; am. 2023, ch. 31, sec. 3, p. 151.]",

      "text": "39-6107. APPLIED PRINCIPLES. (1) Option of last resort. The J-1 visa waiver and national interest waiver programs are considered a final source for recruiting qualified physicians. These programs are not a substitute for broad recruiting efforts for graduates from United States medical schools, but an option of last resort. Any application that qualifies for consideration under any other interested government agency or federal program, such as the one administered by the department of health and human services, must be submitted under that program in lieu of the J-1 visa waiver program. The option of last resort principle does not apply to national interest waiver petitioning physicians for whom a J-1 visa waiver request was issued by the state of Idaho; in which case, physician retention is the objective if it is determined to be in the public interest.\n\n(2) Waiver request applications will only be considered for health care facilities that can provide evidence of sustained active recruitment over a period of at least three (3) months for the physician vacancy in the practice location. The three (3) month vacancy requirement does not apply to a national interest waiver petitioning physician for whom a J-1 visa waiver request was issued by the state of Idaho.\n\n(3) The J-1 visa waiver program and national interest waiver program will be used to assist health care facilities that can document the provision of health care services to all residents of the federally determined area of underservice. When a federal designation is for an underserved population, the health care facility must document the provision of care to, and assure access by, the underserved population.\n\n[39-6107, added 2004, ch. 128, sec. 1, p. 440; am. 2009, ch. 106, sec. 7, p. 328; am. 2017, ch. 72, sec. 4, p. 174; am. 2023, ch. 31, sec. 4, p. 152.]",

Documentation that fully explains why this route was not taken for placement is required as part of the application.\n\n(11) The physician’s name and practice location will be made available to the public as a provider who accepts medicare and medicaid.\n\n(12) An assurance letter that the health care facility, its principals, and the J-1 or national interest waiver petitioning physician are not under investigation for, under probation for, or under restriction for medicare or medicaid fraud, or other violations of law or licensure restrictions that may indicate that it may not be in the public interest that a waiver be granted, must be provided.\n\n(13) The applicant and its principals must be free of default on any federal or state scholarship or loan repayment program such as the national health service corps.\n\n[39-6108, added 2004, ch. 128, sec. 1, p. 440; am. 2009, ch. 106, sec. 8, p. 329; am. 2017, ch. 72, sec. 5, p. 174; am. 2023, ch. 31, sec. 5, p. 153.]",

      "text": "39-6112. JOINT REPORTING REQUIREMENT UPON COMMENCEMENT OF PRACTICE. (1) Notification of waiver status and commencement of employment must be submitted to the department upon receipt of written notification of approval from the immigration agency. This notification must include the date the medical service obligation commences, and a copy of the notification of approval from the immigration agency.\n\n(2) The waiver physician and the applicant must, on commencement of practice and annually thereafter or more frequently as determined by the department, and upon expiration of the physician’s service obligation to the underserved area, verify the physician’s practice site address and field of practice. Further, documentation that the population the physician was to serve was indeed served must be submitted. This will include the facility’s payer mix, the number of patients seen by the physician, and the payer mix of those patients. When submitting the final report, the physician must indicate whether he intends to remain in the shortage area to practice.\n\n(3) Sites receiving waiver approval must agree to report to the department on the status of the physician’s activities at the beginning of the physician’s employment and every year thereafter during the three (3) to five (5) year medical service obligation period. Failure to provide these reports within thirty (30) days of the annual anniversary date of approval of the J-1 visa or national interest waiver in an accurate manner or failure to demonstrate good faith in utilizing a physician’s services in accordance with these policies will jeopardize future eligibility for placements and will be cause for reporting and referral to the United States department of state and immigration agency. This referral could ultimately lead to deportation proceedings against the physician.\n\n(4) Any amendments made to the required elements of the employment contract during the physician’s medical service obligation must be reported to the department for review. The department will complete review and provide notice of approval or declination of such amendments within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt.\n\n[39-6112, added 2004, ch. 128, sec. 1, p. 443; am. 2009, ch. 106, sec. 14, p. 334; am. 2017, ch. 72, sec. 11, p. 179.]",
