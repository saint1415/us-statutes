      "text": "39-8008. ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR — RIGHT OF INSPECTION — POSTING. (1) The administrator shall have authority under this section to enter all public school facilities covered by this chapter at reasonable times to inspect, on an annual basis, such facilities for compliance with the Idaho uniform school building safety code; provided however, that inspections shall take into account the age of the school facilities and the appropriate codes that would have been in effect at the time of the construction of such facilities; provided further, that regardless of the codes in effect at the time of construction, imminent safety hazards found in public school facilities shall be identified and the provisions of this chapter relating to such imminent safety hazards shall apply.\n\n(2) If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes does not constitute an imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard, he shall notify in writing the school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge. Such notification shall state, in bold print, that the citations for violations or nonconformances constitute recommendations only.\n\n(3) If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes a serious safety hazard, he shall immediately issue a written order or notice requiring the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge to eliminate the condition without delay and within the time specified by the administrator in the notice or order, but not exceeding one (1) year. The administrator may also designate a licensed professional to independently evaluate the identified condition prior to issuing a written order to eliminate the condition.\n\n(4) If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes an imminent safety hazard, he shall, within two (2) working days, designate a licensed professional to independently evaluate the identified condition prior to issuing any report under this chapter. That licensed professional shall, within fourteen (14) days, complete its independent evaluation of the condition identified by the administrator and notify the administrator of its conclusions. If the administrator determines that the condition constituting an imminent safety hazard could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the evaluation of the designated licensed professional can be completed and before the condition can be eliminated, he shall determine the extent of the area where such condition exists and thereupon shall issue a written order or notice requiring the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge to cause all persons, except those necessary to eliminate the condition, to be withdrawn from and to be restrained from entering such area pending the evaluation of the designated licensed professional. This order shall be withdrawn if the evaluation of the designated licensed professional does not concur with the administrator that the condition constitutes an imminent safety hazard as could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the condition can be eliminated.\n\n(5) If, upon receipt of the findings of the designated licensed professional, the administrator concludes that any condition identified by such licensed professional constitutes an imminent safety hazard, the administrator shall immediately serve, or cause to be served, written notice or order upon the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge describing the imminent safety hazard. The administrator shall also notify in writing the state superintendent of public instruction of such imminent safety hazard. Upon receipt of such written notice or order, the school district superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge shall require all changes necessary to eliminate the imminent safety hazard be made without delay and within the time specified by the administrator in the notice or order. If the condition presenting an imminent safety hazard is not corrected within the specified time, or if the administrator determines that the condition constituting such imminent safety hazard could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before the condition can be eliminated, and if he has not previously done so, he shall determine the extent of the area where such condition exists and thereupon shall issue an order or notice requiring the school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge to cause all persons, except those necessary to eliminate the condition, to be withdrawn from and to be restrained from entering such area. The school district superintendent, principal, board member, or other person in charge shall assist the administrator as necessary to post such areas to prevent injury.\n\n(6) If the administrator finds a violation of the Idaho uniform school building safety code that he concludes constitutes a serious safety hazard and issues a written order or notice requiring the conditions to be eliminated in not more than one (1) year, and the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge contests the administrator’s finding that the condition is a serious safety hazard, then the school superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge shall have fourteen (14) days from the date of the issuance of the administrator’s written order or notice to request a hearing to initiate a contested case under chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. If a hearing is requested, the superintendent of public instruction shall appoint a hearing officer to consider the contested case. All administrative proceedings under this subsection shall be expedited as necessary to assure that serious safety hazards are eliminated as required by this section if the administrator’s initial determination that there was a serious safety hazard is confirmed in the contested case proceedings.\n\n(7) The administrator shall monitor the school district’s progress in addressing any identified imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard to ensure that appropriate corrective action was taken. The administrator may extend the time for completing corrective action if he deems necessary.\n\n(8) Upon completion of corrective action and verification of such completion by the division of occupational and professional licenses and the department of administration, the administrator shall provide a report to the state superintendent of public instruction, the local superintendent of schools and the chair of the local school board.\n\n(9) Annual inspections of public school facilities conducted by the administrator under the provisions of this section shall be funded pursuant to legislative appropriation.\n\n[39-8008, added 2000, ch. 352, sec. 1, p. 1184; am. 2001, ch. 326, sec. 5, p. 1151; am. 2002, ch. 126, sec. 2, p. 353; am. 2002, ch. 158, sec. 3, p. 461; am. 2003, ch. 16, sec. 10, p. 56; am. 2010, ch. 166, sec. 3, p. 341; am. 2023, ch. 15, sec. 18, p. 84.]",

Upon failure of the district superintendent, principal, board of trustees, or other person in charge to comply with the requirements stated in any notice or order relating to an imminent safety hazard or serious safety hazard, the administrator may maintain an action in the name of the state of Idaho to enjoin the district superintendent, principal, board of trustees or other person in charge from acting in violation of such notice or order or from doing any action that interferes with the administrator carrying out his statutory duties. Such action shall be brought in the district court in which said acts are claimed to have been committed by filing a verified complaint setting forth said act. The court, if satisfied from such complaint or affidavits that the act complained of has been or is being committed and will persist, may issue a temporary writ without notice or bond enjoining the defendant from the commission of such act pending final disposition of the cause. The cause shall proceed as in other causes for injunction. If, at the trial, the commission of said act by the defendant be established and the court further finds it probable that the defendant will continue in such act or similar acts, the court shall enter a decree enjoining said defendant from committing said or similar acts.\n\n[39-8009, added 2000, ch. 352, sec. 1, p. 1185; am. 2002, ch. 158, sec. 4, p. 463.]",
