It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state to provide for the protection of the environment and the promotion of personal health and to thereby protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the people of this state.\n\n(2) The goal of the legislature in enacting the ground water quality protection act of 1989 shall be to maintain the existing high quality of the state’s ground water and to satisfy existing and projected future beneficial uses including drinking water, agricultural, industrial and aquacultural water supplies. All ground water shall be protected as a valuable public resource against unreasonable contamination or deterioration. The quality of degraded ground water shall be restored where feasible and appropriate to support identified beneficial uses.\n\n(3) In enacting this law, the legislature intends to prevent contamination of ground water from point and nonpoint sources of contamination to the maximum extent practical. In attaining the goals enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the legislature wishes to enumerate the following ground water quality protection goals:\n\n(a) It is the policy of the state to prevent contamination of ground water from any source to the maximum extent practical.\n\n(b) The discovery of any contamination that poses a threat to existing or projected future beneficial uses of ground water shall require appropriate actions to prevent further contamination. These actions may consist of investigation and evaluation or enforcement actions if necessary to stop further contamination or clean up existing contamination as required under the environmental protection and health act.\n\n(c) All persons in the state should conduct their activities so as to prevent the nonregulated release of contaminants into ground water.\n\n(d) Education of the citizens of the state is necessary to preserve and restore ground water quality.\n\n(4) It is the policy of the state to protect ground water and to allow for the extraction of minerals above and within ground water. A mine operator shall protect current and projected future beneficial uses of ground water at a point of compliance designated pursuant to rules of the department. Degradation of ground water is allowed at a point of compliance if the mine operator implements the level of protection during mining activities appropriate for the aquifer category.\n\n[39-102, added 1972, ch. 347, sec. 2, p. 1017; am. 1989, ch. 421, sec. 1, p. 1028; am. 2015, ch. 223, sec. 1, p. 686.]",

(1) The state of Idaho is experiencing the development of large swine feeding operations which are inadequately controlled through existing state regulatory mechanisms. If not properly regulated, these facilities pose a threat to the state’s surface and ground water resources. Due to existing rulemaking authority, the department of environmental quality is in the best position of all state agencies to modify its present rules and to make new rules to develop an adequate regulatory framework for large swine feeding operations.\n\n(2) The department of environmental quality is authorized to modify its existing administrative rules and to make new rules regulating large swine feeding operations, as they shall be defined by the department. The department is authorized to work with the Idaho department of agriculture in the development of such rules.\n\n(3) Owners and operators of swine facilities required to obtain a permit from the department of environmental quality to construct, operate, expand or close the facilities shall provide financial assurances demonstrating financial capability to meet requirements for operation and closure of the facilities and remediation. Requirements for financial assurances shall be determined by the agency as set forth in rule. Financial assurances may include any mechanism or combination of mechanisms meeting the requirements established by agency rule including, but not limited to, surety bonds, trust funds, irrevocable letters of credit, insurance and corporate guarantees. The mechanism(s) used to demonstrate financial capability must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under applicable law and must ensure that the funds necessary to meet the costs of closure and remediation will be available whenever the funds are needed. The director may retain financial assurances for up to five (5) years after closure of a facility to ensure proper closure and remediation, as defined by rule.\n\n(4) Those swine facilities described in section 39-7905, Idaho Code, shall meet the requirements of section 39-7907, Idaho Code, in addition to the requirements of this chapter and the department of environmental quality’s rules regulating swine facilities, prior to the issuance of a final permit by the director. The director shall require that swine facilities be constructed in a phased manner over a period of time and that no additional facilities be constructed until the director approves the associated waste treatment system.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section prohibits the boards of county commissioners of any county or the governing body of any city from adopting regulations that are more stringent or that require greater financial assurances than those imposed by the department of environmental quality. A board of county commissioners of a county or a governing body of a city in which a swine facility is located may choose to determine whether the facility is properly closed according to imposed standards or may leave that determination to the department. This choice shall be communicated to the director in writing when closure begins; provided that determinations of closure by a board of county commissioners of a county or a governing body of a city in which the swine facility is located shall not permit closure under less stringent requirements than those imposed by the department.\n\n(6) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Animal unit\" means a unit equaling two and one-half (2.5) swine, each weighing over twenty-five (25) kilograms (approximately fifty-five (55) pounds), or ten (10) weaned swine, each weighing under twenty-five (25) kilograms.

(1) The director shall cause investigations to be made upon receipt of information concerning an alleged violation of this act or of any rule, permit or order promulgated thereunder, and may cause to be made such other investigations as the director shall deem advisable.\n\n(2) For the purpose of enforcing any provision of this chapter or any rule authorized in this chapter, the director or the director’s designee shall have the authority to:\n\n(a) Conduct a program of continuing surveillance and of regular or periodic inspection of actual or potential environmental hazards, air contamination sources, water pollution sources and of solid waste disposal sites;\n\n(b) Enter at all reasonable times upon any private or public property, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, for the purpose of inspecting or investigating to ascertain possible violations of this act or of rules, permits or orders adopted and promulgated by the director or the board;\n\n(c) All inspections and investigations conducted under the authority of this chapter shall be performed in conformity with the prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures contained in the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States and section 17, article I, of the constitution of the state of Idaho. The state shall not, under the authority granted by this chapter, conduct warrantless searches of private property in the absence of either consent from the property owner or occupier or exigent circumstances such as a public health or environmental emergency;\n\n(d) Any district court in and for the county in which the subject property is located is authorized to issue a search warrant to the director upon a showing of (i) probable cause to suspect a violation, or (ii) the existence of a reasonable program of inspection. Any search warrant issued under the authority of this chapter shall be limited in scope to the specific purposes for which it is issued and shall state with specificity the manner and the scope of the search authorized.\n\n(3) Whenever the director determines that any person is in violation of any provision of this act or any rule, permit or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this act, the director may commence either of the following:\n\n(a) Administrative enforcement action.\n\n(i) Notice. The director may commence an administrative enforcement action by issuing a written notice of violation. The notice of violation shall identify the alleged violation with specificity, shall specify each provision of the act, rule, regulation, permit or order which has been violated and shall state the amount of civil penalty claimed for each violation. The notice of violation shall inform the person to whom it is directed of an opportunity to confer with the director or the director’s designee in a compliance conference concerning the alleged violation. A written response may be required within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice of violation by the person to whom it is directed.\n\n(ii) Scheduling compliance conference. If a recipient of a notice of violation contacts the department within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the notice, the recipient shall be entitled to a compliance conference. The conference shall be held within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt of the notice, unless a later date is agreed upon between the parties. If a compliance conference is not requested, the director may proceed with a civil enforcement action as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(iii) Compliance conference. The compliance conference shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of violation to explain the circumstances of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for remedying damage caused by the alleged violation and assuring future compliance.\n\n(iv) Consent order. If the recipient and the director agree on a plan to remedy damage caused by the alleged violation and to assure future compliance, they may enter into a consent order formalizing their agreement. The consent order may include a provision providing for payment of any agreed civil penalty.\n\n(v) Effect of consent order. A consent order shall be effective immediately upon signing by both parties and shall preclude any civil enforcement action for the same alleged violation. If a party does not comply with the terms of the consent order, the director may seek and obtain, in any appropriate district court, specific performance of the consent order and such other relief as authorized in this chapter.\n\n(vi) Failure to reach consent order. If the parties cannot reach agreement on a consent order within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the notice of violation or if the recipient does not request a compliance conference as per paragraph (a)(ii) of this subsection, the director may commence and prosecute a civil enforcement action in district court, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(b) Civil enforcement action. The director may initiate a civil enforcement action through the attorney general as provided in section 39-109, Idaho Code. Civil enforcement actions shall be commenced and prosecuted in the district court in and for the county in which the alleged violation occurred and may be brought against any person who is alleged to have violated any provision of this act or any rule, permit or order which has become effective pursuant to this act. Such action may be brought to compel compliance with any provision of this act or with any rule, permit or order promulgated hereunder and for any relief or remedies authorized in this act. The director shall not be required to initiate or prosecute an administrative action before initiating a civil enforcement action.\n\n(4) No civil or administrative proceeding may be brought to recover for a violation of any provision of this chapter or a violation of any rule, permit or order issued or promulgated pursuant to this chapter more than two (2) years after the director had knowledge or ought reasonably to have had knowledge of the violation.\n\n(5) Monetary penalties.\n\n(a) Any person determined in a civil enforcement action to have violated any provision of this act or any rule, permit or order promulgated pursuant to this act shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed the following amounts:\n\n(i) For any violation of any provision of this act, rule, permit or order related to air quality: ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each separate air violation and day of continuing air violation, whichever is greater;\n\n(ii) For any violation of any provision of this act, rule, permit or order related to the Idaho national pollutant elimination system program: ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation or five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day of a continuing violation, whichever is greater; or\n\n(iii) For any violation of any provision of this act, rule, permit or order related to any other regulatory program authorized by this act: ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation or one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day of a continuing violation, whichever is greater.\n\nThe method of recovery of said penalty shall be by a civil enforcement action in the district court in and for the county where the violation occurred. All civil penalties collected under this act shall be paid into the general fund of the state. Parties to an administrative enforcement action may agree to a civil penalty as provided in this subsection.\n\n(b) The imposition or computation of monetary penalties may take into account the seriousness of the violation, good faith efforts to comply with the law, and an enforceable commitment by the person against whom the penalty is directed to implement a supplemental environmental project. For purposes of this section, \"supplemental environmental project\" means a project which the person is not otherwise required to perform and which prevents pollution, reduces the amount of pollutants reaching the environment, contributes to public awareness of environmental matters or enhances the quality of the environment. In evaluating a particular supplemental environmental project proposal, preference may be given to those projects with an environmental benefit that relate to the violation or the objectives of the underlying statute that was violated or that enhances the quality of the environment in the general geographic location where the violation occurred.\n\n(6) In addition to such civil penalties, any person who has been determined to have violated the provisions of this act or the rules, permits or orders promulgated thereunder shall be liable for any expense incurred by the state in enforcing the act, or in enforcing or terminating any nuisance, source of environmental degradation, cause of sickness or health hazard.\n\n(7) No action taken pursuant to the provisions of this act or of any other environmental protection law shall relieve any person from any civil action and damages that may exist for injury or damage resulting from any violation of this act or of the rules, permits and orders promulgated thereunder.\n\n(8) In addition to, and notwithstanding other provisions of this act, in circumstances of emergency creating conditions of imminent and substantial danger to the public health or environment, the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general may institute a civil action for an immediate injunction to halt any discharge, emission or other activity in violation of provisions of this act or rules, permits and orders promulgated thereunder. In such action the court may issue an ex parte restraining order.\n\n(9) In any administrative or civil enforcement proceeding for violation of any Idaho NPDES program rule, permit, requirement or order, the department shall comply with the public participation requirements set forth in 40 CFR 123.27(d)(2).\n\n[39-108, added 1972, ch. 347, sec. 8, p. 1017; am. 1974, ch. 23, sec. 52, p. 633; am. 1986, ch. 60, sec. 2, p. 170; am. 1993, ch. 275, sec. 5, p. 933; am. 1997, ch. 94, sec. 2, p. 221; am. 2000, ch. 132, sec. 16, p. 330; am. 2014, ch. 40, sec. 1, p. 92.]",

There should be no conditions of approval of the state program that have the effect of undermining or circumventing these principles;\n\n(g) That the decision to accept delegation of authority from the environmental protection agency to operate an NPDES program has significant public policy implications that should be made by the legislature.\n\n(2) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish requirements that must be satisfied prior to legislative approval of a permitting program that complies with the clean water act and incorporates flexible permitting procedures and rules to be promulgated by the board.\n\n[39-175A, added 2005, ch. 57, sec. 1, p. 211; am. 2014, ch. 40, sec. 3, p. 96.]",

      "text": "39-176E. CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW PHOSPHOGYPSUM STACKS — LATERAL EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING PHOSPHOGYPSUM STACKS. Any operator desiring to construct a new phosphogypsum stack, a material component thereof, or a lateral expansion shall submit to the department of environmental quality for review and approval prior to commencing construction a design and construction plan, including construction quality control, that includes minimum design and construction requirements to control and minimize the movement of waste and waste constituents into the environment. Plans and specifications submitted to satisfy the requirements of sections 39-176A through 39-176F, Idaho Code, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer. The minimum design requirements include the following features and standards:\n\n(1) Run-on and runoff controls for the phosphogypsum stack systems for the collection, control, and treatment, as needed, of run-on and runoff from the systems. The controls shall be capable of managing a flow resulting from a twenty-four (24) hour, twenty-five (25) year rainfall event or from a combined peak precipitation and snowmelt event over a twenty-four (24) hour period using snowfall, precipitation, and other meteorological data from the historical record.\n\n(2) Any new phosphogypsum stack or lateral expansion shall be designed with an overall factor of safety of 1.5 for any potential failure surface encompassing the impoundment on top of the stack and passing through the phosphogypsum slope or bottom liner interfaces or extending into earthen material in contact with the bottom liner.\n\n(3) Liner and leachate control systems that achieve the following minimum design standards:\n\n(a) Phosphogypsum stacks, collection ponds, decant ponds, and cooling ponds shall be constructed atop a composite liner or approved alternative of equivalent hydraulic conductivity and durability. Liners shall be constructed of materials that have appropriate physical, chemical, and mechanical properties to prevent failure. A composite liner will have both a synthetic and a nonsynthetic component.\n\n(i) The synthetic component shall consist of a sixty (60) mil or thicker HDPE or equivalent geomembrane with a maximum water vapor transmission rate of twenty-four hundredths (0.24) of one gram per square meter per day as determined by the American society for testing and materials (ASTM) method E96-80, procedure BW.\n\n(ii) The nonsynthetic component shall consist of either soil, phosphogypsum, or sedimented phosphogypsum or equivalent material.\n\n1. Soil or equivalent material. A layer of compacted soil or other equivalent material at least eighteen (18) inches thick, placed below the geomembrane, with a maximum hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-7 centimeters per second, constructed in six (6) inch lifts.\n\n2. Phosphogypsum. A layer of mechanically compacted phosphogypsum at least twenty-four (24) inches thick, placed above the geomembrane, with a maximum hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-4 centimeters per second. A layer of compacted phosphogypsum is not required for any vertical expansion or natural ground slopes steeper than 2.5H:1V abutting a vertical or horizontal expansion where phosphogypsum slurry is discharged in the expansion area.\n\n(iii) The nonsynthetic layer of the composite liner is not required for vertical expansions where:\n\n1. It has been demonstrated that a synthetic liner alone or in contact with sedimented phosphogypsum placed in slurry form will be equivalent or superior to a composite liner;\n\n2. It has been demonstrated that a synthetic liner in contact with sedimented phosphogypsum placed in a slurry form is equivalent or superior to a composite liner with twenty-four (24) inches of compacted phosphogypsum placed above the geomembrane; or\n\n3. For lateral expansions, it has been demonstrated and certified by a third-party professional engineer that a synthetic liner in contact with sedimented phosphogypsum placed in slurry form, and with consideration of the physical hydrogeological setting of the specific lateral expansion, provides an equivalent or superior degree of protection for human health and the environment.\n\n(iv) The nonsynthetic layer of the composite liner will not be required for an alternative liner, such as a double synthetic liner, that has the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and durability to a composite liner.\n\n(v) An approved alternative shall have the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and durability of a composite liner.\n\n(vi) For an intermediate liner, a composite liner is not required.\n\n(b) All liner and leachate control system components shall have appropriate quality control and quality assurance standards, specifications, and procedures for construction, including:\n\n(i) Procedures and tests that will be used to monitor the installation of the liner system components shall be described in detail;\n\n(ii) Description of sampling activities, sample size, sample locations, minimum frequency of testing, acceptance and rejection criteria, and plans for implementing corrective measures that may be necessary; and\n\n(iii) Description of reporting for constructive quality assurance and quality control activities, including observation data sheets, problem identification, corrective measures, and final documentation.\n\n(c) Phosphogypsum stacks shall have a leachate control system. Any leachate emanating from a phosphogypsum stack system shall be routed to a collection pond, such as a decant pond or similar water structure, to be contained within the system or recirculated to the production plant, or, if discharged, treated if required to meet applicable water quality and discharge requirements. All toe drain or leachate collection systems shall be constructed within the lined system. Leachate control systems shall:\n\n(i) Have a perimeter underdrain system designed to stabilize the side slopes of the phosphogypsum stack that is installed above the geomembrane liner; and\n\n(ii) Have perimeter drainage conveyances that either consist of covered or uncovered ditches that are lined continuously with sixty (60) mil or thicker HDPE or equivalent geomembrane, or of chemically compatible leachate collection pipes. Covered ditches shall have manholes or appropriate cleanout structures at appropriate intervals unless a third-party engineer certifies and identifies areas where manholes or cleanout structures in piped systems are not feasible.\n\n(d) Auxiliary holding ponds shall be designed with a synthetic liner or an approved alternative of equivalent hydraulic conductivity and durability.\n\n(e) Process wastewater conveyances shall be constructed with a liner or pipe.\n\n(4) Perimeter dikes that shall incorporate minimum design standards for freeboard, safety, and slope stability design factors, construction methods, and other related parameters, including:\n\n(a) Ground that will become the foundation of perimeter dikes shall be stripped of vegetation and organic detritus or residue, including muck, slimes, or other material that would flow or undergo excessive consolidation under heavy loading. All earth foundation surfaces on which fill is to be placed shall be scarified, or moistened and compacted, prior to spreading the first course of fill material.\n\n(b) A program of soil sampling and testing adequate to determine the characteristics of the foundation material that will support the proposed perimeter dike and the material to be used to construct the perimeter dike.\n\n(c) The crest of the perimeter dike shall be graded toward the inside slope or the outside slope. Both inside and outside slopes shall not be steeper than two and one-half (2.5) horizontal to one (1.0) vertical (2.5H:1V). A liner shall be constructed on the inside slope of the perimeter dike and be suitably connected to the remainder of the liner system to provide seepage control.\n\n(d) The freeboard of an above-grade perimeter dike shall not be less than five (5) feet unless a freeboard of less than five (5) feet is justified based on results of seepage and stability analysis and wave run-up analysis. In no event shall the freeboard of an above-grade perimeter dike be less than three (3) feet.\n\n(e) A stability analysis shall be performed taking into consideration the minimum fluid level as well as the fluid level at the freeboard on the upstream slope of the perimeter dike and possible fluctuations of the tailwater level. When applicable, the stability analysis will include a seepage or flow net analysis.\n\n(f) The following minimum safety factors will be used for perimeter dikes: 1.75 for horizontal shear at base of fill; 1.5 for horizontal shear within the fill due to seepage through the outer face; 1.5 for horizontal shear or circular arc failure through the foundation soils; 1.5 for protection against shear failure of any circular arc in either inside or outside slope. In determining design safety factors, water pressure distribution must be addressed.\n\n(g) A seismic stability analysis shall be performed.\n\n(h) Appropriate quality control and quality assurance standards, specifications, and procedures for perimeter dike construction shall be implemented.\n\n(5) Any lateral expansion must be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as a new phosphogypsum stack. Except for incidental deposits of phosphogypsum entrained in the process wastewater, or conditioned phosphogypsum used as a cushion layer against rock slope, placement of phosphogypsum outside the phosphogypsum stack footprint is considered a lateral expansion.\n\n(6) The design and construction plan submitted to the department must contain a process for notification and department approval of deviations from the approved design and construction plan.\n\n[39-176E, added 2020, ch. 51, sec. 5, p. 121; am. 2021, ch. 246, sec. 5, p. 764.]",
