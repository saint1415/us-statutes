(1) All persons who shall be confined or imprisoned in any state prison facility in this state shall be examined for on admission, and again upon the offender’s request before release, and, if infected, treated for the diseases enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, and this examination shall include a test for HIV antibodies or antigens. This examination is not intended to limit any usual or customary medical examinations that might be indicated during a person’s imprisonment. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to interfere with the service of any sentence imposed by a court as a punishment for the commission of crime. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to impose upon any state prison facility an obligation to continue to treat a person who tested positive for any disease enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, or be financially responsible for such treatment after the person is released from the state prison facility.\n\n(2) All persons who shall be confined in any county or city jail may be examined for and, if infected, treated for the venereal diseases enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, if such persons have, in the judgment of public health authorities or the jailer, been exposed to a disease enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) All persons who are charged with any sex offense in which body fluid, as defined in this chapter, has likely been transmitted to another shall be tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). At the request of the victim or parent, guardian or legal custodian of a minor victim, such test shall be administered not later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date on which the information or indictment is presented.\n\n(4) All persons, including juveniles, who are charged with sex offenses, prostitution, any crime in which body fluid has likely been transmitted to another, or other charges as recommended by public health authorities shall be tested for the venereal diseases enumerated in section 39-601, Idaho Code, and for hepatitis C virus.\n\n(5) All persons who are charged with any crime involving the use of injectable drugs shall be tested for the presence of HIV antibodies or antigens, for hepatitis C virus and for hepatitis B virus.\n\n(6) If a person is tested as required in subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section, the results of the test shall be revealed to the court.

Whenever a prisoner tests positive for HIV antibodies or antigens, the victim(s) of said prisoner shall be entitled to counseling regarding HIV, HIV testing in accordance with applicable law, and referral for appropriate health care and support services. Said counseling, HIV testing and referral services shall be provided to the victim(s) by the district health departments at no charge to the victim(s). Provided however, the requirement to provide referral services does not, in and of itself, obligate the district health departments to provide or otherwise pay for a victim’s health care or support services. Any court, when releasing test results to a victim(s), or if the victim(s) is a minor, to the minor’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian, shall explain or otherwise make the victim(s) or the victim’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian, aware of the services to which the victim(s) is entitled as described herein.\n\n(7) Responsibility for the examination, testing and treatment of persons confined in county or city jails shall be vested in the county or city that operates the jail.
