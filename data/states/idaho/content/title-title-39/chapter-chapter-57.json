The prevention of youth access to tobacco products and electronic smoking devices within the state of Idaho is hereby declared to be a state goal to promote the general health and welfare of Idaho’s young people.\n\nTobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Idaho, and nicotine is a highly addictive, potentially harmful substance. Both present an urgent public health challenge. New and emerging tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices like electronic cigarettes are linked to an increase in youth use of tobacco and nicotine products, are connected to the use of traditional tobacco products like cigarettes, and are associated with increased addiction in youth users. Therefore, it is this state’s policy to prevent the illegal sale, theft, and easy access of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices to minors, to prohibit the possession, distribution, and use of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices by minors, and to otherwise discourage and prevent the possession, use, and trafficking in tobacco products and electronic smoking devices by minors.\n\n[39-5701, added 1998, ch. 418, sec. 2, p. 1316; am. 2020, ch. 318, sec. 1, p. 906.]",
