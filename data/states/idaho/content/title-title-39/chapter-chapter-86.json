Personnel performing work covered by this chapter must, by documented training or experience or both, be familiar with the operation and safety functions of the components and equipment and be licensed in accordance with this chapter. Training and experience shall include, but are not limited to, recognizing the safety hazards and performing the procedures to which they are assigned in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. This chapter establishes the minimum acceptable standards for personnel performing all inspections required in this chapter.\n\n(2) This chapter is not intended to prevent the use of systems, methods or devices of equivalent or superior quality, strength, fire resistance, code effectiveness, durability and safety to those required by this chapter, provided that there is technical documentation to demonstrate the equivalency of the system, method or device, as prescribed in this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter.\n\n[39-8602, added 2004, ch. 359, sec. 1, p. 1067.]",
