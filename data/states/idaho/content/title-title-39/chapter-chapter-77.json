      "text": "39-7701. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that access to high quality health care services is a concern of all persons. However, access to such services is severely limited for some residents of the state, particularly those who reside in remote, rural areas or in the urban areas. Physicians and other health care professionals have traditionally worked to assure broad access to health care services and many are willing to volunteer their services to address the health care needs of Idahoans who may otherwise not be able to obtain such services. The public policy of this state is to encourage and facilitate voluntary provision of health care services.\n\n[39-7701, added 1998, ch. 295, sec. 1, p. 976.]",

      "text": "39-7703. IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PROVIDING CHARITABLE MEDICAL CARE. (1) Any health care provider who voluntarily provides needed medical or health care services to any person at a free medical clinic or who provides health screenings at a community health screening event without compensation or the expectation of compensation shall be immune from liability for any civil action arising out of the provision of such medical or health services. This section shall not extend immunity to the health care provider for any acts constituting intentional, willful or grossly negligent conduct or to acts by a health care provider that are outside the scope of practice authorized by the provider’s licensure, certification or registration.\n\n(2) Immunity pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall apply only if the health care provider and the patient execute a written waiver in advance of the rendering of such medical services specifying that such services are provided without the expectation of compensation and that the health care provider shall be immune as specified herein.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a free medical clinic from accepting voluntary contributions for health care services provided to a patient who has acknowledged his or her ability and willingness to pay a portion of the value of the health care services provided. Any voluntary contribution collected for providing care at a free medical clinic shall be used only to pay overhead expenses of operating the clinic. No portion of any moneys collected shall be used to provide compensation to any health care provider.\n\n(4) If a health care provider is insured for liability for negligent acts or omissions arising from providing health care services at a free clinic, the immunity provided in subsection (1) of this section is waived, provided however, the amount recovered shall not exceed the limits of such applicable insurance coverage.\n\n[39-7703, added 1998, ch. 295, sec. 1, p. 977; am. 2018, ch. 38, sec. 2, p. 98.]",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a party names as a defendant a health care provider who has immunity pursuant to section 39-7703, Idaho Code, in a suit alleging willful or intentional misconduct or gross negligence arising out of treatment at a free clinic which qualifies for immunity pursuant to section 39-7703, Idaho Code, and the trial judge dismisses the complaint or grants a defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, or directs a verdict for a defendant, or grants a defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or at any point in the proceedings grants a plaintiff’s motion to discontinue the action against the defendant, the defendant shall be entitled to full costs and reasonable attorney’s fees expended in connection with the defendant’s defense of the action.
