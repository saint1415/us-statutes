(1) It is the intent of the adult abuse, neglect, and exploitation act to authorize the fewest possible restrictions on the exercise of personal freedom and religious beliefs consistent with a vulnerable adult’s need for services and to empower vulnerable adults to protect themselves.\n\n(2) The legislature recognizes that vulnerable adults sometimes experience difficulties managing their own affairs or are unable to protect themselves from maltreatment. Often, vulnerable adults cannot find others who are able or willing to provide assistance.\n\n(3) The commission is directed to investigate allegations of vulnerable adult maltreatment, to make appropriate referrals to law enforcement, and to arrange for the provision of necessary services. Further, the commission shall honor a vulnerable adult’s freedom of choice and right to self-determination. When it becomes necessary for the commission to assist a vulnerable adult, actions shall be tempered by the requirements of due process and must place the fewest possible restrictions on personal freedom. Services provided under this chapter are also intended to provide assistance to a caregiver to help maintain a vulnerable adult in the household.\n\n(4) In the process of carrying out its adult protective services responsibilities, the commission is directed to make effective use of multidisciplinary services available through any and all public agencies, community-based organizations, and informal resources.\n\n[39-5301A, added 1998, ch. 308, sec. 2, p. 1020; am. 2019, ch. 43, sec. 1, p. 116; am. 2023, ch. 158, sec. 1, p. 426.]",
