Any such authorization shall remain effective for the period of time designated in the resolution, regardless of whether the composition of the authority changes in the interim.\n\n(c) If deemed advisable by the authority there may be retained in the resolutions or the trust indenture under which any bonds of the authority are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such resolutions or in such trust indenture, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such resolutions or in such trust indenture, and as may be briefly recited on the face of the bonds, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the authority the right or option to redeem any bonds except as may be provided in the resolutions or in such trust indenture under which they shall be issued.\n\n(d) The bonds or notes of the authority may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the authority, and the authority may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which it may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. The power to fix the date of sale of bonds and notes, to receive bids or proposals, to award and sell bonds and notes, and to take all other necessary action to sell and deliver bonds and notes may be delegated to the executive director of the authority by resolution of the authority. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the authority may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(e) Issuance by the authority of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same facilities or any other facilities or any other purpose hereunder, but the resolutions or trust indenture whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Any bonds of the authority at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the authority by the issuance of its bonds for such purpose in such amount as the authority may deem necessary and, if deemed advisable by the authority, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a facility or any portion thereof.\n\nAny such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same facilities or separate facilities or for any other purpose hereunder, and regardless of whether or not the bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise. The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may, in the discretion of the authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the authority. Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations determined by the authority. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded, to the payment of principal or interest on the refunding bonds or may be used by the authority in any lawful manner. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the authority for use by it in any lawful manner. The portion of the proceeds of any such bonds issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a facility may be invested and reinvested in obligations determined by the authority. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on such investment may be applied to the payment of all or any part of such cost or may be used by the authority in any lawful manner. All such bonds shall be subject to the provisions of this act in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds issued pursuant to this act. All bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto are hereby made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of article 8, uniform commercial code, subject only to the provisions of such bonds, notes or other obligations for registration.\n\n[39-1449, added 1972, ch. 134, sec. 9, p. 286; am. 1973, ch. 178, sec. 7, p. 393; am. 1985, ch. 72, sec. 2, p. 145; am. 2000, ch. 125, sec. 1, p. 296.]",

The principal of and interest on any bonds or notes issued by the authority may be secured by a pledge of, or security interest in, the revenues, rentals and receipts out of which the same may be made payable or from other moneys available therefor and not otherwise pledged or used as security and may be secured by a trust indenture or mortgage or deed of trust (including assignment of leases or other contract rights of the authority thereunder) covering all or any part of the facilities from which the revenues, rentals or receipts so pledged or used as security may be derived, including any enlargements of and additions to any such facilities thereafter made. The resolution under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any such trust indenture, mortgage or deed of trust may contain any agreements and provisions which shall be a part of the contract with the holders of the bonds or notes to be authorized as to:\n\n(a) Pledging or providing a security interest in all or any part of the revenues of a facility or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by the authority with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to secure the payment of the bonds or notes or of any particular issue of bonds, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist;\n\n(b) Respecting the maintenance of the properties covered thereby;\n\n(c) The fixing and collection of rents, fees, and other charges to be charged, and the amounts to be raised in each year thereby, and the use and disposition of the revenues;\n\n(d) The setting aside, creation and maintenance of special and reserve funds and sinking funds and the use and disposition of the revenues;\n\n(e) Limitations on the right of the authority or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of facilities;\n\n(f) Limitations on the purpose to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of bonds or notes then or thereafter to be issued may be applied and pledging or providing a security interest in such proceeds to secure the payment of the bonds or notes or any issue of the bonds or notes;\n\n(g) Limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds;\n\n(h) The procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders or noteholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds or notes the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given;\n\n(i) Limitations on the amount of moneys derived from a facility to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the authority;\n\n(j) Defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the duties of the authority to holders of its obligations and providing the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default;\n\n(k) The mortgaging of a facility and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholders or noteholders; and\n\n(l) Such other additional covenants, agreements, and provisions as are judged advisable or necessary by the authority for the security of the holders of such bonds or notes.\n\nAny pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Each pledge, agreement, lease, indenture, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made.
