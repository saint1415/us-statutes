      "text": "39-5001. POLICY. The policy of the state of Idaho is hereby declared to be a recognition of the increasing number of persons in the state who, having fulfilled the valuable role of homemaker, find themselves displaced because of death or disability of spouse, or divorce or other loss of family income. As a consequence, displaced homemakers have an insufficient income; high rate of unemployment due to age, lack of paid work experience and discrimination; and limited opportunities to collect funds of assistance from social security, unemployment compensation, medicaid or other health insurance benefits, or pension plans of the spouse. This chapter seeks to coordinate efforts by state and local public agencies in cooperation with private agencies and organizations to assist displaced homemakers to continue as productive citizens, even though their role has necessarily changed.\n\n[(39-5001) 39-4901, added 1980, ch. 333, sec. 1, p. 859; am. and redesig. 2005, ch. 25, sec. 61, p. 105.]",
