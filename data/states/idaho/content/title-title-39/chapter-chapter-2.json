(1) This act shall be known and may be cited as the \"Idaho Vital Statistics Act.\"\n\n(2) The legislature finds:\n\n(a) As early as 1632, government officials began tracking vital statistics, specifically births, deaths, and marriages;\n\n(b) Today, state and local vital records offices record over eleven million (11,000,000) vital events annually in the United States;\n\n(c) Material facts included in vital records include the date of birth, the individual’s sex, the location of birth, the parents’ identities, and the date of death;\n\n(d) The purpose of documenting factual information on vital records is to help the government fulfill one of its most basic duties: protecting the health and safety of its citizens;\n\n(e) Numerous courts have recognized that the purpose of vital records is to maintain an accurate database of factual information regarding births, deaths, and other vital events in a given jurisdiction. See Sea v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 2015 WL 5092509, at *4 (D. Minn. Aug. 28, 2015) (\"The public does have an interest in having accurate records on vital statistics…\"); Ampadu v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Dist. Dir., 944 F. Supp. 2d 648, 655 (C.D. Ill. 2013) (acknowledging \"the public’s interest in having accurate records on vital statistics\"); Boiko v. Holder, 2013 WL 709047, at *2 (D. Colo. Feb. 26, 2013) (\"[T]he government, and the public at large, would appear to benefit from having the most accurate vital statistics records possible.\"); J.R. v. Utah, 261 F. Supp. 2d 1268, 1294 (D. Utah 2002) (\"The State also has a significant interest in the accuracy of the records it keeps, particularly vital records like birth certificates.\");\n\n(f) According to the national research council committee on national statistics, factual information contained in vital records is used to help diagnose and solve problems that impact national health, including tracking and diagnosing disparities in mortality rates based on age and sex, identifying factors that account for the significant differences in life expectancy between males and females, measuring and seeking solutions to socioeconomic inequalities in health based on sex and age, and studying infant death rates based on sex, location, birth weight, and other information collected from vital records;\n\n(g) Factual information from vital records is also necessary for national security. It is used to identify potential disease epidemics, such as the zika virus, that may disproportionately impact one sex over the other; expose covert bioterrorist attacks, such as determining whether a sudden increase in certain symptoms in a population is due to random chance or should be further investigated; and identify criminals and terrorists, where vital records can be used to uncover fraudulently obtained driver’s licenses or passports; and\n\n(h) Allowing individuals to alter their vital records, including birth certificates, based upon subjective feelings or experiences undermines the government’s interest in having accurate vital records.\n\n[39-240, added 1949, ch. 72, sec. 32, p. 117; am. and redesig. 39-240, 1983, ch. 7, sec. 1, p. 25; am. 2020, ch. 334, sec. 1, p. 970.]",

      "text": "39-245A. CERTIFICATES OF BIRTH — MATERIAL FACTS INCLUDED — AMENDMENTS.\n\n(1)(a) The legislature finds that:\n\n(i) There is a compelling interest in maintaining accurate, quantitative, biology-based material facts on Idaho certificates of birth that provide material facts fundamental to the performance of government functions that secure the public health and safety, including but not limited to identifying public health trends, assessing risks, conducting criminal investigations, and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders;\n\n(ii) The equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits purposeful discrimination, not facially neutral laws of general applicability, such as a biology-based definition of sex that has been consistently applied since our nation’s founding;\n\n(iii) Decades of court opinion have upheld the argument that biological distinctions between male and female are a matter of scientific fact, and biological sex is an objectively defined category that has obvious, immutable, and distinguishable characteristics;\n\n(iv) Identification of biological sex on a birth certificate impacts the health and safety of all individuals. For example, the society for evidence-based gender medicine has declared that the conflation of sex and gender in health care is alarming, subjects hundreds of thousands of individuals to the risk of unintended medical harm, and will greatly impede medical research;\n\n(v) Vital statistics are defined in section 39-241(21), Idaho Code, as data, being the plural of datum, which is a known fact;\n\n(vi) Idaho certificates of birth are of an evidentiary character and prima facie evidence of the facts recited therein, according to section 39-274, Idaho Code;\n\n(vii) Age and sex, unlike the names of natural parents whose rights have been terminated, are legally applicable facts fundamental to the performance of public and private policies and contracts;\n\n(viii) The failure to maintain accurate, quantitative vital statistics and legal definitions upon which the government and others may with confidence rely constitutes a breach of the public trust; and\n\n(ix) The government has a compelling interest in maintaining the public trust and confidence and a duty to fulfill, to the best of its ability, those functions that rely on accurate vital statistics.\n\n(b) Based on the findings in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the legislature directs that an Idaho certificate of birth shall document specific quantitative, material facts at the time of birth, as provided in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(2) Any certificate of birth issued under the provisions of this chapter shall include the following quantitative statistics and material facts specific to that birth: time of birth, date of birth, sex, birth weight, birth length, and place of birth.\n\n(3) For purposes of this chapter, \"sex\" is as defined in section 73-114, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) The quantitative statistics and material facts identified in subsection (2) of this section may be amended within one (1) year of the filing of the certificate by submitting to the registrar a notarized affidavit of correction that:\n\n(a) Is on a form prescribed by the registrar;\n\n(b) Is signed by:\n\n(i) The parents identified on the certificate of birth; or\n\n(ii) The child’s legal guardian;\n\n(c) Is signed by the physician or other person in attendance who provided the medical information and certified to the facts of birth; and\n\n(d) Declares that the information contained on the certificate of birth incorrectly represents a material fact at the time of birth.\n\nAfter one (1) year, the quantitative statistics and material facts identified in subsection (2) of this section may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the party challenging the acknowledgment.\n\n(5) In those instances in which an individual suffers from a physiological disorder of sexual development and the individual’s biological sex cannot be recognized at birth as male or female based upon externally observable reproductive anatomy, the physician shall make a presumptive determination of the individual’s sex, which may thereafter be amended based on the appropriate combination of genetic analysis and evaluation of the individual’s naturally occurring internal and external reproductive anatomy as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a hospital may correct a birth certificate for a clerical or data entry error at any time by submitting a notarized affidavit on a form specified by the registrar with any appropriate supporting documentation.\n\n[39-245A, added 2020, ch. 334, sec. 2, p. 971; am. 2024, ch. 322, sec. 5, p. 1066.]",

ADOPTION OF PERSONS BORN IN IDAHO — NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE ISSUED TO REPLACE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE — PROCEDURE — ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS NOT OPEN TO INSPECTION WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS — DUTIES OF THE CLERKS OF COURTS ISSUING ADOPTION DECREES — DUTIES OF STATE REGISTRAR OF VITAL STATISTICS. (1) Whenever a final decree of adoption, issued by an Idaho court, declares a person born in Idaho to be adopted by someone other than his or her natural parents, the court shall require the preparation of a report (denominated as a certificate in accordance with Idaho court rules) of adoption on a form prescribed and furnished by the state registrar. The report shall include such facts as are necessary to locate and identify the certificate of birth of the person adopted; shall provide information necessary to establish a new certificate of birth for the person adopted; and shall identify the order of adoption and be certified by the clerk of the court.\n\n(2) Information necessary to prepare the report of adoption shall be furnished by each petitioner for adoption or the petitioner’s attorney. The provision of such information shall be prerequisite to the issuance of a final decree in the matter of the court.\n\n(3) The report of adoption shall, within fifteen (15) days after becoming final, be recorded by the clerk of the court with the bureau of vital records and health statistics in the state department of health and welfare.\n\n(4) If a court of some other state issued a decree or report of adoption of a person actually born in Idaho, the certified copy or report may be similarly filed by the person involved or by the adoptive parents. Failure to file certified copies or reports of said decrees within said period of time, however, shall not bar issuance of a new birth certificate as hereinafter provided. This copy of said decree or report shall be filed with and remain a part of the records of the bureau of vital records and health statistics.\n\n(5) Upon receipt by the bureau of vital records and health statistics of the certified report of adoption, a new certificate of birth shall be issued (but only in cases where such person’s birth is already recorded with the bureau of vital records and health statistics) bearing among other things the name of the person adopted, as shown in the report of adoption, except that a new certificate of birth shall not be established if so requested by the court decreeing the adoption, the adoptive parents, or the adopted person. No such birth certificate shall have reference to the adoption of said person. Such birth certificate shall supplant and constitute a replacement of any birth certificate previously issued for said person and shall be the only birth certificate open to public inspection. Provided however, upon good cause shown and the affidavit of the adoptive parents that a diligent search has been made, but no certificate of birth for the adoptive child can be located, the magistrate judge may order the adoptive child examined, at the expense of the adoptive parents, by a doctor of medicine licensed by the state of Idaho. The examination will be conducted pursuant to rules promulgated by the state board of health and welfare for the purpose of determining those matters required for the issuance of an original birth certificate. Upon the examination of the doctor made pursuant to the rules of the state board of health and welfare, the court may order the bureau of vital records and health statistics to issue an original birth certificate for the adoptive child based upon those facts determined by the examination and included in the court’s order. In such case, a certified copy of the court order shall be provided to the bureau of vital records and health statistics.\n\n(6) In respect to form and nature of contents, such a new birth certificate shall be identical with a birth certificate issued to natural parents for the birth of a child, except that the adoptive parents shall be shown as parents and the adopted person shall have the name assigned by the decree of adoption as shown on the report of adoption. In a case where a single person adopts another person, any new birth certificate may designate the adopting parent as adoptive.\n\n(7) Whenever an adoption decree is amended, annulled, or rescinded, the clerk of the court shall forward a certified copy of the amendment, annulment, or rescindment to the bureau of vital records and health statistics in accordance with the time provisions in subsection (3) of this section. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the bureau of vital records and health statistics shall amend the certificate of birth upon receipt of a certified copy of an amended decree of adoption.

However, the board shall, by rule and upon such conditions as it may prescribe to assure compliance with the purposes of the vital statistics act, provide for the filing of death certificates without medical certifications of cause of death in cases in which compliance with the applicable prescribed period would result in undue hardship; but provided, however, that medical certifications of cause of death shall be provided by the certifying physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or coroner to the vital statistics unit within fifteen (15) days from the filing of the death certificate. No certificate shall be deemed complete until every item of information required shall have been provided or its omission satisfactorily accounted for. When death occurs in a moving conveyance in the United States and the body is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the death shall be registered in this state and the place where the body is first removed shall be considered the place of death. When a death occurs on a moving conveyance while in international airspace or in a foreign country or its airspace and the body is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the death shall be registered in this state but the certificate shall show the actual place of death insofar as can be determined. If the place of death is unknown but the dead body is found in this state, the certificate of death shall be completed and filed in accordance with this section. The place where the body is found shall be shown as the place of death. If the date of death is unknown, it shall be determined by approximation.\n\nThe person in charge of interment or of removal of the body from the district shall be responsible for obtaining and filing the certificate.

In the absence of the attending physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse or with said person’s approval the certificate may be completed and signed by said person’s associate, who must be a physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, the chief medical officer of the institution in which the stillbirth occurred, or the physician who performed an autopsy on the stillborn fetus, provided such individual has access to the medical history of the case and views the fetus at or after stillbirth.
