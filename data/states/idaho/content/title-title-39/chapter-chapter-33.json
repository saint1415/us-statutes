Interviews with residents shall be confidential and conducted privately unless otherwise specified by the resident.\n\n(8) The licensing agency shall notify the facility, in writing, of all deficiencies, provide a proposed plan of correction for all deficiencies, and approve a reasonable length of time for compliance by the facility. At the time of the exit conference, the licensing agency shall provide the facility a written report specifying the non-core issue deficiencies. Facilities are not required to submit plans of correction for non-core deficiencies.\n\n(9) When core issues are identified during a survey, the licensing agency shall provide a written report within ten (10) business days of the exit conference or the last day of receipt of additional material. Facilities may either adopt the proposed plan of correction or submit an alternative plan of correction for approval by the department for core issue deficiencies.\n\n(10) If any deficiencies constitute an immediate jeopardy, the department shall require immediate correction of deficient practice.\n\n(11) Current lists of deficiencies, including plans of correction, shall be available to the public upon request in the individual facilities or by written request to the department.\n\n(12) The licensing agency shall conduct follow-up surveys to ascertain corrections to issues are made according to the time frames established in the plan of correction for core issues. If the department identifies repeat deficient facility practices during any follow-up survey, the department may initiate or extend enforcement actions.\n\n(13) The department shall accept an accreditation survey from an accreditation commission for a residential care or assisted living facility instead of regular compliance inspections conducted under the authority of this section if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The accreditation commission’s standards meet or exceed the state requirements for licensure for residential care or assisted living facilities;\n\n(b) The facility submits to the department a copy of its required accreditation reports to the accreditation commission in addition to the application and any other information required for renewal of a license;\n\n(c) The inspection results are available for public inspection to the same extent that the results of an investigation or inspection conducted under this section are available for public inspection;\n\n(d) The accreditation commission complies with the health insurance portability and accountability act and takes reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information concerning the residents of the facility; and\n\n(e) If the facility’s accreditation report is not valid for the entire licensure period, the department may conduct a compliance inspection of the facility during the time period for which the department does not have a valid accreditation report.\n\n(14) The department shall establish a self-inspection program for facilities that receive a gold or silver rating, defined as high ratings with no significant deficiencies on the most recent inspection.

(1) If the licensing agency finds, on the basis of inspections as defined in this chapter or otherwise, that a residential or assisted living facility no longer meets a requirement of this chapter, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies:\n\n(a) Immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the department shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in section 39-3358(1)(c), Idaho Code, or prohibit the facility from keeping or admitting residents and may provide, in addition, for one (1) or more of the other remedies described in section 39-3358, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the department shall provide for one (1) or more of the remedies described in section 39-3358, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the department to remedy a facility’s deficiencies. If the department finds that a facility meets the requirements of this chapter, but, as of a previous period, intentionally did not meet such requirements, the department may provide for a civil money penalty under section 39-3358(1)(b), Idaho Code, for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.\n\n(3) Residential care or assisted living facilities may be cited only for a violation of a requirement that is specified in an applicable law or in a rule promulgated in compliance with an applicable law. Facilities may not be cited for an act that is not expressly proscribed by an applicable law or rule or for an omission when an applicable law or rule does not expressly require the conduct omitted. If the department requires a specific corrective action in relation to a citation, that requirement must be in writing and reference the corresponding rule.\n\n(4) If a civil money penalty is assessed against a facility for deficiencies that do not require relocation of residents or facility closure, the facility may use funds equal to the penalty amount to correct the deficiencies instead of paying the penalty. Documentation of expenditures addressing the deficiencies must be submitted to the department.\n\n(5) Funds collected from such penalties, including those held by the department on July 1, 2025, or collected after such date, may be used by facilities through a department-administered grant program to improve resident care and quality of life. The department shall establish guidelines and a process for grant applications and fund distribution.\n\n[39-3357, added 1990, ch. 116, sec. 2, p. 258; am. 2000, ch. 274, sec. 42, p. 826; am. 2016, ch. 210, sec. 1, p. 593; am. 2025, ch. 208, sec. 21, p. 949.]",

Funds collected by the department as a result of imposition of such a penalty shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of residential or assisted living facilities that the department finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.\n\n(c) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while:\n\n(i) There is an orderly closure of the facility.\n\n(ii) Improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(iii) The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated until the department has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(d) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to summarily suspend the license, to close the facility, and/or to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities.\n\n(2) The department shall also specify criteria as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.\n\n[39-3358, added 1990, ch. 116, sec. 2, p. 258; am. 2000, ch. 274, sec. 43, p. 827.]",
