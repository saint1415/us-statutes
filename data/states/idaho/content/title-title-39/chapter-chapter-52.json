      "text": "39-5201. DECLARATION OF POLICY. The legislature finds that domestic violence is an issue of growing concern. Research findings show that domestic violence constitutes a significant percentage of homicides, aggravated assaults, and assaults and batteries in the United States. Domestic violence is a disruptive influence on personal and community life and is often interrelated with a number of other family problems and stresses. Refuge for victims of domestic violence is essential to provide protection to victims from further abuse and physical harm. Refuge provides temporary safety and resources to victims who may not have access to such things if they remain in abusive situations.\n\nIt is the purpose of the legislature in the adoption of this chapter to provide funding for projects in the several areas of the state for the purpose of aiding victims of domestic violence and other crimes.\n\nIt is understood that the intention of the provisions of this chapter is not to supersede the authority or responsibilities of agencies of state government responsible for providing services to persons pursuant to the child protective act, crime victims compensation act or adult protective provisions in the Idaho Code.\n\n[39-5201, added 1982, ch. 181, sec. 1, p. 470; am. 2000, ch. 343, sec. 1, p. 1161.]",
