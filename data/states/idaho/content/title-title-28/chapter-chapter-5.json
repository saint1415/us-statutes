(1) This chapter applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations arising out of transactions involving letters of credit.\n\n(2) The statement of a rule in this chapter does not by itself require, imply, or negate application of the same or a different rule to a situation not provided for, or to a person not specified, in this chapter.\n\n(3) With the exception of this subsection, subsections (1) and (2), sections 28-5-102(1)(i) and (1)(j), 28-5-106(4) and 28-5-114(4), and except to the extent prohibited in sections 28-1-302 and 28-5-117(4), the effect of this chapter may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking. A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this chapter.\n\n(4) Rights and obligations of an issuer to a beneficiary or a nominated person under a letter of credit are independent of the existence, performance, or nonperformance of a contract or arrangement out of which the letter of credit arises or which underlies it, including contracts or arrangements between the issuer and the applicant and between the applicant and the beneficiary.\n\n[28-5-103, added 1996, ch. 7, sec. 2, p. 11; am. 2004, ch. 43, sec. 35, p. 156.]",

An adviser that is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or give value for a presentation. An adviser undertakes to the issuer and to the beneficiary accurately to advise the terms of the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice received by that person and undertakes to the beneficiary to check the apparent authenticity of the request to advise.

Determination of the issuer’s observance of the standard practice is a matter of interpretation for the court. The court shall offer the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of the standard practice.\n\n(6) An issuer is not responsible for:\n\n(a) the performance or nonperformance of the underlying contract, arrangement, or transaction,\n\n(b) an act or omission of others, or\n\n(c) observance or knowledge of the usage of a particular trade other than the standard practice referred to in subsection (5) of this section.\n\n(7) If an undertaking constituting a letter of credit under section 28-5-102(1)(j) contains nondocumentary conditions, an issuer shall disregard the nondocumentary conditions and treat them as if they were not stated.\n\n(8) An issuer that has dishonored a presentation shall return the documents or hold them at the disposal of, and send advice to that effect to, the presenter.\n\n(9) An issuer that has honored a presentation as permitted or required by this chapter:\n\n(a) is entitled to be reimbursed by the applicant in immediately available funds not later than the date of its payment of funds,\n\n(b) takes the documents free of claims of the beneficiary or presenter,\n\n(c) is precluded from asserting a right of recourse on a draft under sections 28-3-414 and 28-3-415,\n\n(d) except as otherwise provided in sections 28-5-110 and 28-5-117, is precluded from restitution of money paid or other value given by mistake to the extent the mistake concerns discrepancies in the documents or tender which are apparent on the face of the presentation, and\n\n(e) is discharged to the extent of its performance under the letter of credit unless the issuer honored a presentation in which a required signature of a beneficiary was forged.\n\n[28-5-108, added 1996, ch. 7, sec. 2, p. 12.]",

(1) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation. If the issuer’s obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant’s election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant’s recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.\n\n(2) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach.\n\n(3) If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this article or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (1) and (2) of this section.\n\n(4) An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date.\n\n(5) Reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter.\n\n(6) Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this article may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.\n\n[28-5-111, added 1996, ch. 7, sec. 2, p. 14.]",
