      "text": "67-7301. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. The legislature finds that Idaho’s deaf and hard of hearing citizens make up thirteen percent (13%) of the state’s population, with approximately one-half (1/2) of this constituency being elderly. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are capable of doing everything well except hearing. The deaf and hard of hearing need help in bridging the communication gap into the hearing world. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals deserve equal access to jobs, housing, education, and information. Unfortunately, the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing have long been overlooked and underserved. Services that are available are fragmented and incomplete. There is an urgent need for an entity to coordinate state-level programs to assure accommodation and access services for the deaf and hard of hearing. The purpose of this chapter is to establish an advisory council for the deaf and hard of hearing whose mission will be to create an environment in which deaf and hard of hearing Idahoans of all ages have an equal opportunity to participate fully as active, responsible, productive, and independent citizens of the state.\n\n[67-7301, added 1991, ch. 122, sec. 1, p. 265; am. 2020, ch. 12, sec. 7, p. 26.]",
