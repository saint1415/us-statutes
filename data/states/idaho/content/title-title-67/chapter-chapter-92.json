Any determinations officer appointed pursuant to this section shall exist only for the duration of unresolved complaints on an acquisition and shall be dismissed upon resolution of all such complaints. The determinations officer shall be guided in his determination by the best economic interests of the state for both the near future and more extended periods of time. In addition to the powers conferred on the determinations officer, the director may:\n\n(a) Impose the penalty prescribed by section 67-9231(3), Idaho Code;\n\n(b) Enjoin any activity that violates this chapter;\n\n(c) Direct that bids be rejected or sustained;\n\n(d) Direct that specifications be rejected, sustained or modified; and\n\n(e) Direct further legal action.\n\n(7) Challenges or appeals conducted pursuant to subsection (1), (2), (3)(a)(i), or (3)(a)(ii) of this section shall not be considered to be a contested case as that term is defined in the administrative procedure act.
