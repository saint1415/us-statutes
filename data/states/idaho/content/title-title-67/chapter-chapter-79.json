Until such verification of lawful presence is made, the attestation may be presumed to be proof of lawful presence for purposes of this section.\n\n(a) Errors and significant delays by the SAVE program shall be reported to the United States department of homeland security to ensure that the application of the SAVE program is not wrongfully denying benefits to legal residents of this state.\n\n(b) Agencies or political subdivisions may adopt variations of the requirements of subsection (4)(d) of this section to improve efficiency or reduce delay in the verification process or to provide for adjudication of unique individual circumstances in which the verification procedures in this section would impose unusual hardship on a legal resident of this state; except that the variations shall be no less stringent than the requirements of subsection (4)(d) of this section.\n\n(c) A person who knowingly makes a false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in an attestation executed pursuant to subsection (4)(d) or (6)(b) of this section or who knowingly provides a social security number that has not been assigned to him pursuant to subsection (4)(c) of this section shall be:\n\n(i) Guilty of a misdemeanor for the first and second offense; and\n\n(ii) Guilty of a felony for each subsequent offense.\n\n(7) An agency or political subdivision may accept as prima facie evidence of an applicant’s lawful presence in the United States the information required in subsection (4) of this section, as may be modified by subsection (5) of this section, when issuing a professional license or a commercial license.\n\n[67-7903, added 2007, ch. 311, sec. 1, p. 878; am. 2008, ch. 27, sec. 19, p. 58; am. 2009, ch. 177, sec. 20, p. 572; am. 2009, ch. 197, sec. 1, p. 633; am. 2011, ch. 280, sec. 1, p. 760; am. 2011, ch. 291, sec. 28, p. 812; am. 2022, ch. 318, sec. 61, p. 1032; am. 2025, ch. 275, sec. 2, p. 1167.]",
