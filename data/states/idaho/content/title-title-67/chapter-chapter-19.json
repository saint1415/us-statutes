More measures may be requested by the germane committee chairs through the process set forth in subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(ii) Results for each measure for the prior four (4) fiscal years. In situations where past data is not available because a new measure is being used, the report shall indicate the situation.\n\n(iii) Benchmarks or performance targets for each measure for, at a minimum, the next fiscal year, and for each year of the four (4) years of reported actual results.\n\n(iv) Explanations, where needed, which provide context important for understanding the measures and the results, and any other qualitative information useful for understanding agency performance.\n\n(v) Attestation from the agency director that the data reported has been internally assessed for accuracy, and, to the best of the director’s knowledge, is deemed to be accurate.\n\n(2) Each agency performance report shall be presented in a consistent format, determined by the division of financial management, which allows for easy review and understanding of the information reported.\n\n(3) Each agency shall review the results of the performance measures compared to benchmarks or performance targets and shall use the information for internal management purposes.\n\n(4) Each agency shall maintain reports and documentation that support the data reported through the performance measures.
