The legislature finds that disability is a natural part of the human experience that does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental disabilities to live independently, to exert control and choice over their own lives, and to fully participate in and contribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion in all aspects of their lives; that individuals with developmental disabilities comprise from 1.2 to 1.65 percent of the population; that individuals with developmental disabilities are at greater risk of discrimination and abuse, neglect, and exploitation; that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families often do not have access to appropriate services, support and other assistance to live independent lives in their homes and communities; that an increasing number of people with developmental disabilities are living at home with aging parents as primary caregivers; and that services and programs are located within diverse agencies and organizations with no central point for coordination and cooperation, comprehensive planning, evaluation, monitoring and advocating on behalf of people with developmental disabilities. This act is designed to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of, and have access to, needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in all facets of community life through culturally appropriate programs. This act is also intended to assure the dignity of persons with developmental disabilities, by reaffirming their rights, which are the same rights as other people of the state of the same age and include the right to live as complete and normal lives as possible and to develop their abilities and potential to the fullest extent possible.\n\nIt is understood that the intention of this act is not to supersede the authority or responsibilities of agencies of state government responsible for providing services to persons with developmental disabilities.\n\n[67-6701, added 1978, ch. 269, sec. 1, p. 618; am. 2002, ch. 113, sec. 1, p. 317.]",
