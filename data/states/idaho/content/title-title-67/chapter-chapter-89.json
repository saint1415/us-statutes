(1) It is hereby determined and declared that:\n\n(a) Industrial, irrigation, commercial and residential consumers in the state of Idaho receive electric service from various investor-owned, cooperative and municipal utilities and the ability of these utilities to provide reliable and economic electric services at stable prices is essential to the economy and the economic development of the state of Idaho and to the health, safety and welfare of its people;\n\n(b) The regional interconnection of electric utilities causes events and conditions in other western states to have a significant impact on the operations of utilities in the state of Idaho and the restructuring of the electric industry in recent years by the federal government and in other states has exposed all utilities in Idaho, and the consumers served by them, to volatile market prices, reliability concerns and other adverse conditions;\n\n(c) It is in the best interest of the state of Idaho and its people that sufficient and reliable electric generation and transmission resources are developed and made available at cost-based rates in order to enable these utilities to meet existing and future demands for electric services, to provide adequate reserves and to promote reliability at the most stable rates practicable;\n\n(d) The electric utility and energy industries are and will continue to be capital-intensive industries and the availability of cost-effective financing to investor-owned, cooperative and municipal utilities will enhance the ability of these utilities to provide and promote economic electric services to consumers in the state;\n\n(e) Coordination, cooperation and joint ventures between and among such utilities with one another and with the private, cooperative, federal, state and municipal utilities and agencies that provide wholesale and retail electric services in the western states will promote regional electric reliability and stability and will provide economies of scale;\n\n(f) It is the intent of the legislature to create the Idaho energy resources authority to promote the development and financing of facilities for the benefit of participating utilities and to accomplish the purposes stated above, and to authorize the authority to exercise all such powers as are necessary to enable it to achieve such purposes and to thereby promote and protect the economy of the state of Idaho and the health, safety and welfare of its people; and\n\n(g) It is in the best interest of the state of Idaho and its people to encourage and promote the development of clean energy resources in order to develop reliable, economic, and long-term sources of energy supply, promote efficiencies in the generation, storage, transmission, and utilization of electric energy, and enhance the long-term stability of the energy resources and requirements of the state.\n\n(2) Nothing contained herein is intended or shall be construed to limit or restrict the authority of the Idaho public utilities commission with respect to the regulation of electric corporations and public utilities pursuant to title 61, Idaho Code.\n\n[67-8902, added 2005, ch. 53, sec. 1, p. 192; am. 2005, ch. 311, sec. 1, p. 964; am. 2023, ch. 24, sec. 1, p. 134.]",

(1) A participating utility contracting with the authority for the electricity, service or product provided by a facility may establish one (1) or more rate stabilization charges, cost recovery charges or power cost adjustment charges as it deems necessary to provide for the payment of all amounts owed by the participating utility to the authority with respect to the facility and otherwise enable the participating utility to stabilize its rates, to protect its consumers from volatile market prices and to insure against market and other risks. Such rate stabilization charges, cost recovery charges or power cost adjustment charges may be established by the participating utility as a separate component of its existing rates and charges or as a new charge.\n\n(2) A participating utility that is subject to rate regulation by the commission shall submit each of its proposed rate stabilization charges, cost recovery charges or power cost adjustment charges to the commission for approval.\n\n(3) Each other participating utility that serves electric consumers in the state but which is not subject to rate regulation by the commission, may establish a rate stabilization charge, cost recovery charge or power cost adjustment charge only after it has provided adequate notice of and a public meeting or hearing on such charge to the members or consumers served by it. A notice shall be deemed to be adequate if:\n\n(a) It is given at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public meeting or hearing in the manner usually employed by the participating utility to give notice of its hearings or meetings, by mail, publication or otherwise; and\n\n(b) It provides a brief description of the proposed rate stabilization, cost recovery or power cost adjustment charges and a summary of the purposes for which it is being established.\n\nAfter the meeting or hearing has been held, the participating utility may proceed to establish and fix the rate stabilization, cost recovery or power cost adjustment charge.\n\n(4) Each participating utility may agree in its contractual arrangements with the authority as to the use and disposition of all or any part of the revenues from any rate stabilization, cost recovery or power cost adjustment charges established by the participating utility. Each participating utility may pledge, and may create and grant a security interest in, all or a portion of such revenues to secure its payment obligations to the authority in respect of any facility. Any such agreement or pledge by a participating utility that is a municipal corporation of the state shall not be deemed to create an indebtedness or liability of such municipal corporation or a loan or donation of its credit within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision.\n\n[67-8912, added 2005, ch. 53, sec. 1, p. 200.]",
