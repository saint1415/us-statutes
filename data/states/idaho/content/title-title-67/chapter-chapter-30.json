A law enforcement agency may contract or make arrangements with a jail or correctional facility or other criminal justice agency to take the required fingerprints from a person who is arrested by the law enforcement agency.\n\n(4) If a person was arrested and is in the custody of a law enforcement agency, jail or correctional facility and a felony summons or information is filed for an offense separate from the offense for which the person is in custody, the agency, jail or correctional facility shall take the fingerprints of the person in connection with the new offense.\n\n(5) At the initial court appearance or arraignment of a person for an offense pursuant to a felony summons or information, the court, upon notice from the prosecuting attorney, shall order a law enforcement agency to fingerprint the person if he has not been previously fingerprinted for the same offense.\n\n(6) When a defendant is convicted or otherwise adjudicated for a felony offense for which the defendant has not been previously fingerprinted, the court shall order, upon notice from the prosecuting attorney, a law enforcement agency to fingerprint the defendant as a condition of sentence, probation or release.\n\n(7) When a person is received by a state correctional facility, the department of correction shall ensure that legible fingerprints of the person are taken and submitted to the bureau.\n\n(8) When the bureau receives fingerprints of a person in connection with an arrest or incarceration, the bureau shall make a reasonable effort to confirm within five (5) working days the identity of the person fingerprinted. In an emergency situation when an immediate positive identification is needed, a criminal justice agency may request the department to provide immediate identification service.\n\n(9) If the arresting officer, the law enforcement agency that employs the officer, or the jail or correctional facility where fingerprints were taken is notified by the bureau that fingerprints taken under this section are not legible, the officer, agency or facility shall make a reasonable effort to obtain a legible set of fingerprints. If legible fingerprints cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time, and if illegible fingerprints were taken under a court order, the officer or agency shall inform the court, which shall order the defendant to submit to fingerprinting again.\n\n(10) Any person who was arrested or served a criminal summons and who subsequently was not charged by indictment or information within one (1) year of the arrest or summons and any person who was acquitted of all offenses arising from an arrest or criminal summons, or who has had all charges dismissed, may have the fingerprint and criminal history record taken in connection with the incident expunged pursuant to the person’s written request directed to the department and may have the official court file thereof sealed. This provision shall not apply to any dismissal granted pursuant to section 19-2604(1), Idaho Code.\n\n(11)(a) In addition to the remedies set forth in subsection (10) of this section, any person arrested for, prosecuted for, or convicted of a misdemeanor that is not an assaultive or violent misdemeanor listed in paragraph (b) of this subsection or arrested for, prosecuted for, or convicted of felony possession of a controlled substance under section 37-2732(a), (c), or (e), Idaho Code, in this state may petition the court to have the person’s record be shielded from disclosure in accordance with rules adopted by the Idaho supreme court and within the capabilities of its record-keeping system. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall set a date for a hearing and shall notify the prosecuting attorney of the date of the hearing. Upon receipt of such notification from the court, the prosecuting attorney shall provide to any readily identifiable crime victim whatever notifications are required under section 22, article I of the constitution of the state of Idaho.

Upon such a shielding from disclosure of the petitioner’s records, the court shall notify the Idaho state police of the shielding and, upon receipt of the notification, the Idaho state police shall make any law enforcement investigatory reports and fingerprint records unavailable for public viewing. A special index of the shielding proceedings and records shall be kept by the court ordering the shielding of records, which shall not be available to the public unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this subsection and other than in a judicial proceeding or as part of the licensing process for peace officers, upon the entry of the order, the proceedings in the petitioner’s case shall be deemed never to have occurred, and the petitioner may lawfully reply accordingly to any inquiry in the matter.\n\n(e) A proceeding to shield records from disclosure under the provisions of this subsection shall occur in the underlying criminal case.\n\n(f) A court ordering records to be shielded from disclosure pursuant to this subsection shall notify the supreme court of the shielding, and the supreme court shall, within the capabilities of its record-keeping system, maintain a record of all records shielded, searchable by the name of the person whose records are shielded. To the extent not prohibited by federal law, it shall be the policy of the state of Idaho that the records shielded from disclosure shall not be available to the public but may be accessed at any time by the subject of the petition, by law enforcement personnel, and by court officers to the extent permitted by operative court rules. The record shall otherwise remain shielded from disclosure to the public. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit a law enforcement agency or court officer from accessing any records or databases created or maintained by law enforcement or prosecutors.\n\n(g) A person whose records are shielded from disclosure pursuant to this subsection:\n\n(i) Shall, upon a subsequent felony conviction and upon request by the prosecutor, have such shielding from disclosure revoked by the court as part of his sentencing; and\n\n(ii) May, upon a subsequent misdemeanor conviction and upon request by the prosecutor, have such shielding revoked by the court as part of his sentencing.\n\n(h) A law enforcement agency, prosecuting attorney, or the court shall not incur any civil or criminal liability for the unintentional or negligent release, or the release by a third party, of a record shielded from disclosure pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(i) The shielding from disclosure of records under this subsection shall have no effect on the operation of sections 18-310 and 18-3316, Idaho Code.\n\n(j) To the extent permitted by operative court rules, a POST-certified peace officer or prosecuting attorney shall have complete access to and use of all records shielded from disclosure pursuant to this subsection for purposes including but not be limited to communicating with crime victims, all in-court purposes and hearings, investigations, and enhancements.\n\n(k) A person may have only one (1) petition granted during such person’s lifetime to have one (1) of the crimes eligible under this subsection, or more than one (1) eligible crime under this subsection if committed in a single incident or transaction, shielded from disclosure pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(l) The procedures set forth in this subsection, including the specific processes established that affect access to court records, are subject to the rules of the Idaho supreme court.\n\n[67-3004, added 1999, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 640; am. 2010, ch. 33, sec. 1, p. 63; am. 2018, ch. 286, sec. 1, p. 674; am. 2023, ch. 108, sec. 1, p. 315.]",

The legislature finds that there is a need to improve the quality and completeness of criminal history records made available to a state when it conducts national fingerprint-based record checks for applicant or noncriminal justice purposes. Criminal history records automated and held at the state level are the most complete and accurate sources for fingerprint-based records checks for authorized agencies or organizations screening persons seeking positions of trust. Ratification of the \"National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact\" will provide direct access to criminal history records maintained in other member states.\n\n(2) Enactment. The national crime prevention and privacy compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joined therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nThe contracting parties agree to the following:\n\n(a) In general.

(1) The provisions of this section shall only apply to individuals who are victims of human trafficking pursuant to chapter 86, title 18, Idaho Code, and shall only apply to arrests, criminal prosecutions and convictions that are the result of acts induced by human traffickers.\n\n(2) Any person who was arrested, prosecuted and/or convicted of a violation of section 18-5613, Idaho Code, or any other offense determined by the court to be appropriate, except convictions for offenses for which a defense of coercion would not be available and that was committed during a period of time when the person was a victim of human trafficking and that was the result of acts required by the human trafficker, may bring a petition under the provisions of this section to vacate such conviction and/or to expunge the criminal history records taken in connection with the conviction, including the arrest and prosecution resulting in such conviction or to expunge any criminal history records related to any arrest or prosecution that resulted in a dismissal or acquittal. Actions brought under this section are civil actions and the petitioner shall not be entitled to the appointment of counsel.
