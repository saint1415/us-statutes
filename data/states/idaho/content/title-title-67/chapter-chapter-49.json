No appeal or writ of error shall lie from an order dismissing said proceedings; but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the filing of a subsequent petition or petitions for similar improvements or for a similar district, and the right so to renew such proceedings is hereby expressly granted and authorized.\n\nAny time after the filing of the petition for the organization of a district and before the day fixed for the hearing thereon, the owner or owners of any real property within the proposed district may file a petition with the district court stating reasons why said property should not be included therein, why his land or any part thereof will not be benefited directly or indirectly by the proposed district, or should not be embraced in said district and made liable to taxation therefor, and praying that said property be excluded therefrom. Such petition shall be duly verified and shall describe the property sought to be excluded. The court shall conduct a hearing on said petition and shall hear all objections to the inclusion in the district of any lands described in said petition. In case any owner of real estate included in said proposed district shall satisfy the court that his real estate, or any part thereof, has been wrongfully included therein or will not be benefited thereby then the court shall exclude such real estate as will not be benefited.\n\nUpon said hearing, if it shall appear that a petition for the organization of a district has been signed and presented as hereinabove provided, in conformity with this chapter, and that the allegations of the petition are true, the court shall, by order duly entered of record, direct that the question of the organization of the district shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the district at an election to be held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, for that purpose, and such order shall direct the county clerk to appoint election officials of the election. The county clerk of the county having jurisdiction shall give published notice of the time and place of an election to be held in the district.\n\nSuch election shall be held and conducted in accordance with the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code.\n\nAt any time after the filing of the petition herein referred to and before the day fixed for hearing, nominees for the board of directors of the district may be nominated by the filing of a petition designating the name or names of the nominee or nominees, signed by at least five (5) qualified electors of the district. If upon the hearing as herein provided the court shall order an election for the creation of the district, the court shall also ascertain the names of persons nominated by the board of directors, and shall order that the names of persons whom the court finds to have been properly nominated shall be listed upon a ballot submitted to the electors at such election. In the event the court makes its order providing for such election, it shall prescribe the form of the question and ballot relating to the election of the directors, provided that all matters may be contained upon one (1) ballot to be submitted to the voters.\n\nAt such election the voters shall vote for or against the organization of the district, and for five (5) qualified electors, who shall constitute the board of directors of the district, if organized, one (1) director to act until the first biennial election, two (2) until the second, and two (2) until the third biennial election.\n\nThe county board of canvassers shall certify the returns of the election to the district court having jurisdiction. If a majority of the votes cast at said election are in favor of the organization, the district court shall declare the district organized and give it a corporate name by which, in all proceedings, it shall thereafter be known, and designated the first board of directors elected, and thereupon the district shall be a governmental subdivision of the state of Idaho and a body corporate with all the powers of a public or quasi-municipal corporation except that districts formed prior to January 1, 1987, or districts with twenty-five thousand (25,000) or more population shall have no power to levy and collect property taxes.\n\nIf an order be entered establishing the district, such order shall be deemed final and no appeal or writ of error shall lie therefrom, and the entry of such order shall finally and conclusively establish the regular organization of the said district against all persons except the state of Idaho, in an action in the nature of a writ of quo warranto, commenced by the attorney general within thirty (30) days after said decree declaring such district organized as herein provided, and not otherwise. The organization of said district shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action or proceeding except as herein expressly authorized.\n\n[67-4907, added 1959, ch. 137, sec. 7, p. 299; am. 1987, ch. 70, sec. 1, p. 130; am. 1995, ch. 118, sec. 91, p. 502; am. 1998, ch. 21, sec. 3, p. 124; am. 2001, ch. 258, sec. 3, p. 928; am. 2009, ch. 341, sec. 148, p. 1070.]",

Such petition, which may be in one (1) or more papers, shall state the name of the district and shall be signed by not less than three thousand (3,000) qualified electors resident within the boundaries of the district or fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of qualified electors resident within the boundaries of the district, whichever is less.\n\n(b) Within thirty (30) days after the filing of such petition, the county commissioners shall determine whether or not the same substantially complies with the requirements of this section. If the county commissioners find that there has not been substantial compliance with such requirements, they shall enter an order to that effect specifying the particular deficiencies and dismissing the petition. If the county commissioners find that there has been substantial compliance with such requirements, the county commissioners shall forthwith enter an order to that effect and call an election for the dissolution of such district to be held at the same time as the next county general election, as provided in this section.\n\n(c) If the county commissioners order an election as provided in this section, such election shall be conducted and notice thereof given by the county clerk in accordance with the provisions of title 34, Idaho Code.\n\n(d) Immediately after such election, the county commissioners shall canvass the vote as provided in chapter 12, title 34, Idaho Code. If one-half (1/2) or more of the votes cast at such election are against the dissolution of such district, the county commissioners shall enter an order so finding and declaring that such district shall not be dissolved. If more than one-half (1/2) of the votes cast at such election are in favor of dissolving such district, the county commissioners shall enter an order so finding and declaring such district duly dissolved. The county commissioners shall cause one (1) certified copy of such order to be filed in the office of the county recorder of such county. Immediately upon the entry of such order, the dissolution of such district shall be complete.\n\n(e) Upon such dissolution being complete, title to all property of the dissolved district shall vest in the county where such property is situated. The county commissioners shall then: sell and dispose thereof in the manner provided by law for the sale or disposition of county property; apply the proceeds thereof to pay any lawful claims against the dissolved district, if any; and apply the balance remaining, if any, to any public purpose within the county.\n\n(f) When the boundaries of the district lie in two (2) or more counties, the county commissioners of each county shall act separately in the election and dissolution of that part of the district contained in their county but the county commissioners of each such county shall meet together before calling such election and provide for uniform proceedings in each county. If there is any balance remaining after sale and disposition of the property of such dissolved district, it shall be prorated among such counties in proportion to each county’s share of the total assessed valuation of such dissolved district for the preceding calendar year.\n\n(g) After such election, the validity of the proceedings hereunder shall not be affected by any defect in the petition or in the number or qualifications of the signers thereof, and in no event shall any action be commenced or maintained or defense made affecting the validity of the dissolution of such district after six (6) months has expired from the date of entering the order declaring the dissolution of such district.\n\n[67-4930, added I.C., sec. 67-4930, as added by 1975, ch. 154, sec. 2, p. 395; am. 2009, ch. 341, sec. 154, p. 1074; am. 2024, ch. 165, sec. 1, p. 630.]",
