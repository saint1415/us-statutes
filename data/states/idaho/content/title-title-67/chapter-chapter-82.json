The legislature finds that an equitable program for planning and financing public facilities needed to serve new growth and development is necessary in order to promote and accommodate orderly growth and development and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the state of Idaho. It is the intent by enactment of this chapter to:\n\n(1) Ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new growth and development;\n\n(2) Promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform standards by which local governments may require that those who benefit from new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development;\n\n(3) Establish minimum standards for the adoption of development impact fee ordinances by governmental entities;\n\n(4) Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public facilities needed to serve new growth and development and to prevent duplicate and ad hoc development requirements; and\n\n(5) Empower governmental entities which are authorized to adopt ordinances to impose development impact fees.\n\n[67-8202, added 1992, ch. 282, sec. 1, p. 861.]",

      "text": "67-8204. MINIMUM STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ORDINANCES. Governmental entities which comply with the requirements of this chapter may impose by ordinance development impact fees as a condition of development approval on all developments.\n\n(1) A development impact fee shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements determined in accordance with section 67-8207, Idaho Code. Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.\n\n(2) A development impact fee shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities adopted in the development impact fee ordinance of the governmental entity that are applicable to existing development as well as new growth and development. The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing public facilities for which a development impact fee is imposed must be attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new development.\n\n(3) A development impact fee ordinance shall specify the point in the development process at which the development impact fee shall be collected. The development impact fee may be collected no earlier than the commencement of construction of the development, or the issuance of a building permit or a manufactured home installation permit, or as may be agreed by the developer and the governmental entity.\n\n(4) A development impact fee ordinance shall be adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of section 67-8206, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a process whereby the governmental agency shall allow the developer, upon request by the developer, to provide a written individual assessment of the proportionate share of development impact fees under the guidelines established by this chapter which shall be set forth in the ordinance. The individual assessment process shall permit consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by the developer to adjust the amount of the fee. The decision by the governmental agency on an application for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee, including an explanation of factors considered under section 67-8207, Idaho Code, and shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used.\n\n(6) A development impact fee ordinance shall provide a process whereby a developer shall receive, upon request, a written certification of the development impact fee schedule or individual assessment for a particular project, which shall establish the development impact fee so long as there is no material change to the particular project as identified in the individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule. The certification shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee including an explanation of factors considered under section 67-8207, Idaho Code. The certification shall also specify the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used.\n\n(7) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a provision for credits in accordance with the requirements of section 67-8209, Idaho Code.\n\n(8) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a provision prohibiting the expenditure of development impact fees except in accordance with the requirements of section 67-8210, Idaho Code.\n\n(9) A development impact fee ordinance may provide for the imposition of a development impact fee for system improvement costs incurred subsequent to adoption of the ordinance to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the system improvements.\n\n(10) A development impact fee ordinance may exempt all or part of a particular development project from development impact fees provided that such project is determined to create affordable housing, provided that the public policy which supports the exemption is contained in the governmental entity’s comprehensive plan and provided that the exempt development’s proportionate share of system improvements is funded through a revenue source other than development impact fees.\n\n(11) A development impact fee ordinance shall provide that development impact fees shall only be spent for the category of system improvements for which the fees were collected and either within or for the benefit of the service area in which the project is located.\n\n(12) A development impact fee ordinance shall provide for a refund of development impact fees in accordance with the requirements of section 67-8211, Idaho Code.\n\n(13) A development impact fee ordinance shall establish for a procedure for timely processing of applications for determination by the governmental entity regarding development impact fees applicable to a project, individual assessment of development impact fees, credits or reimbursements to be allowed or paid under section 67-8209, Idaho Code, and extraordinary impact.\n\n(14) A development impact fee ordinance shall specify when an application for an individual assessment of development impact fees shall be permitted to be made by a developer or fee payer. An application for an individual assessment of development impact fees shall be permitted sufficiently in advance of the time that the developer or fee payer may seek a building permit or related permits so that the issuance of a building permit or related permits will not be delayed.\n\n(15) A development impact fee ordinance shall provide for appeals regarding development impact fees in accordance with the requirements of section 67-8212, Idaho Code.\n\n(16) A development impact fee ordinance must provide a detailed description of the methodology by which costs per service unit are determined. The development impact fee per service unit may not exceed the amount determined by dividing the costs of the capital improvements described in section 67-8208(1)(f), Idaho Code, by the total number of projected service units described in section 67-8208(1)(g), Idaho Code. If the number of new service units projected over a reasonable period of time is less than the total number of new service units shown by the approved land use assumptions at full development of the service area, the maximum impact fee per service unit shall be calculated by dividing the costs of the part of the capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to the projected new service units described in section 67-8208(1)(g), Idaho Code, by the total projected new service units described in that section.\n\n(17) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a schedule of development impact fees for various land uses per unit of development. The ordinance shall provide that a developer shall have the right to elect to pay a project’s proportionate share of system improvement costs by payment of development impact fees according to the fee schedule as full and complete payment of the development project’s proportionate share of system improvement costs, except as provided in section 67-8214(3), Idaho Code.\n\n(18) After payment of the development impact fees or execution of an agreement for payment of development impact fees, additional development impact fees or increases in fees may not be assessed unless the number of service units increases or the scope or schedule of the development changes. In the event of an increase in the number of service units or schedule of the development changes, the additional development impact fees to be imposed are limited to the amount attributable to the additional service units or change in scope of the development.\n\n(19) No system for the calculation of development impact fees shall be adopted which subjects any development to double payment of impact fees.\n\n(20) A development impact fee ordinance shall exempt from development impact fees the following activities:\n\n(a) Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure which was destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, providing the structure is rebuilt and ready for occupancy within two (2) years of its destruction;\n\n(b) Remodeling or repairing a structure which does not increase the number of service units;\n\n(c) Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with another residential unit on the same lot, provided that the number of service units does not increase;\n\n(d) Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot;\n\n(e) Constructing an addition on a residential structure which does not increase the number of service units; and\n\n(f) Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such as tennis courts or clubhouse, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements.\n\n(21) A development impact fee will be assessed for installation of a modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle unless the fee payer can demonstrate by documentation such as utility bills and tax records, either:\n\n(a) That a modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle was legally in place on the lot or space prior to the effective date of the development impact fee ordinance; or\n\n(b) That a development impact fee has been paid previously for the installation of a modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle on that same lot or space.\n\n(22) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a process for dealing with a project which has extraordinary impacts.\n\n(23) A development impact fee ordinance shall provide for the calculation of a development impact fee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in an incidental benefit to owners or developers within the service area other than the person paying the fee.\n\n(24) A development impact fee ordinance shall include a description of acceptable levels of service for system improvements.\n\n(25) Any provision of a development impact fee ordinance that is inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter shall be null and void and that provision shall have no legal effect. A partial invalidity of a development impact fee ordinance shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the ordinance that are consistent with the requirements of this chapter.\n\n[67-8204, added 1992, ch. 282, sec. 1, p. 864; am. 1996, ch. 366, sec. 2, p. 1229; am. 2002, ch. 347, sec. 2, p. 986.]",

That portion of the cost of preparing a capital improvements plan which is attributable to determining the development impact fee may be funded by a one (1) time ad valorem levy which does not exceed two one-hundredths percent (.02%) of market value or by a surcharge imposed by ordinance on the collection of a development impact fee which surcharge does not exceed the development’s proportionate share of the cost of preparing the plan. For governmental entities required to undertake comprehensive planning pursuant to chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, such capital improvements plan shall be prepared and adopted according to the requirements contained in the local planning act, section 67-6509, Idaho Code, and shall be included as an element of the comprehensive plan.

The persons preparing the plan shall consult with the development impact fee advisory committee.\n\nThe capital improvements plan shall contain all of the following:\n\n(a) A general description of all existing public facilities and their existing deficiencies within the service area or areas of the governmental entity and a reasonable estimate of all costs and a plan to develop the funding resources related to curing the existing deficiencies including, but not limited to, the upgrading, updating, improving, expanding or replacing of such facilities to meet existing needs and usage;\n\n(b) A commitment by the governmental entity to use other available sources of revenue to cure existing system deficiencies where practical;\n\n(c) An analysis of the total capacity, the level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of existing capital improvements, which shall be prepared by a qualified professional planner or by a qualified engineer licensed to perform engineering services in this state;\n\n(d) A description of the land use assumptions by the government entity;\n\n(e) A definitive table establishing the specific level or quantity of use, consumption, generation or discharge of a service unit for each category of system improvements and an equivalency or conversion table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial;\n\n(f) A description of all system improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area based on the approved land use assumptions, to provide a level of service not to exceed the level of service adopted in the development impact fee ordinance;\n\n(g) The total number of service units necessitated by and attributable to new development within the service area based on the approved land use assumptions and calculated in accordance with generally accepted engineering or planning criteria;\n\n(h) The projected demand for system improvements required by new service units projected over a reasonable period of time not to exceed twenty (20) years;\n\n(i) Identification of all sources and levels of funding available to the governmental entity for the financing of the system improvements;\n\n(j) If the proposed system improvements include the improvement of public facilities under the jurisdiction of the state of Idaho or another governmental entity, then an agreement between governmental entities shall specify the reasonable share of funding by each unit, provided the governmental entity authorized to impose development impact fees shall not assume more than its reasonable share of funding joint improvements, nor shall the agreement permit expenditure of development impact fees by a governmental entity which is not authorized to impose development impact fees unless such expenditure is pursuant to a developer agreement under section 67-8214, Idaho Code; and\n\n(k) A schedule setting forth estimated dates for commencing and completing construction of all improvements identified in the capital improvements plan.\n\n(2) The governmental entity imposing a development impact fee shall update the capital improvements plan at least once every five (5) years. The five (5) year period shall commence from the date of the original adoption of the capital improvements plan. The updating of the capital improvements plan shall be made in accordance with procedures set forth in section 67-8206, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) The governmental entity must annually adopt a capital budget.\n\n(4) The capital improvements plan shall be updated in conformance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section each time a governmental entity proposes the amendment, modification or adoption of a development impact fee ordinance.\n\n[67-8208, added 1992, ch. 282, sec. 1, p. 869; am. 1996, ch. 322, sec. 71, p. 1098; am. 1996, ch. 366, sec. 5, p. 1233; am. 2002, ch. 347, sec. 4, p. 990.]",
