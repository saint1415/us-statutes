Interagency billing credits for all moneys shall be deposited to the appropriate fund of that agency.\n\n(b) Interagency receipts may be expended by the collecting agency to the extent that authority to do so has been requested and approved by the legislature through an appropriation.\n\n(c) The agency billed for the goods and services shall classify, treat, and account for such expenses in the same manner as if such expenses had been paid by warrant and may encumber unexpended balances and may carry forward the encumbered appropriation to liquidate known or anticipated interagency billing expenses at the end of a fiscal year. The state controller shall provide for the method of liquidation of these encumbrances.\n\n(4) State agencies selling goods, products, and services to another state agency must use the interagency process detailed by subsection (3) of this section. State agencies, departments, and institutions may sell goods, products, and services to the public and/or other political entities.
