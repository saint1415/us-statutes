The reimbursement shall be returned to the STORE fund for redistribution.\n\n(d) Recreation utility shall be established by the fair market value of the property to be converted, the type and amount of use occurring on the property, equivalent usefulness and location of converted property and other factors the park and recreation board may consider relevant and may be mitigated by placing land previously not in recreation use into recreation use or by improving recreation opportunities on previously developed land commensurate to the loss of recreation utility caused by the conversion.\n\n(3) The department may, by rule, impose a fee to defray the department’s cost of administration and management of this replacement process.\n\n[67-4248, added 1995, ch. 332, sec. 1, p. 1105.]",
