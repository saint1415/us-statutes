Prequalification standards must be premised upon demonstrated technical competence, experience constructing similar facilities, prior experience with the state, past performance related to quality, workmanship and timeliness, reliability, safety record, available nonfinancial resources, equipment and personnel as they relate to the subject project, and overall performance history based upon a contractor’s entire body of work. Any request for qualifications must include the standards for evaluating the qualifications of prospective bidders. Licensed contractors desiring to be prequalified to bid on a project must submit a written response to a request for qualifications. After a review of qualification submittals, licensed contractors that meet the prequalification standards shall be so notified, and licensed contractors that do not meet the prequalification standards shall also be so notified.

Such notice may include publication at least seven (7) days prior to bid opening in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the work is located; or the agency may advertise the invitation for bids in appropriate trade journals, and otherwise notify persons believed to be interested in the award of a contract. Informal bids must be submitted by the contractor in writing in response to a prepared written document describing the project’s scope of work in sufficient detail so as to enable a contractor familiar with such work to prepare a responsible bid. Nothing herein exempts an agency from the responsibility of utilizing formal plans and specifications if the work involves the public health or safety as described in chapters 3 and 12, title 54, Idaho Code.
