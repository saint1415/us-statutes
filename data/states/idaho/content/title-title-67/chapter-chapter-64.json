Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\n(e) Neither the commissioners of the authority nor any other person executing such notes or bonds shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\n(f) The authority, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist, shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase notes or bonds of the authority, which shall thereupon be cancelled, at a price not exceeding\n\n(1) if the notes or bonds are then redeemable, the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment thereon, or\n\n(2) if the notes or bonds are not then redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after such purchase upon which the notes or bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to such date.\n\n(g) In the discretion of the authority, the bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company in the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the exercise of its corporate powers and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The authority may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the authority. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\n(h) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the uniform commercial code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the uniform commercial code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(i) In case any of the commissioners or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any notes or bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such notes or bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery.\n\n[67-6414, added 1974, ch. 111, sec. 14, p. 1263.]",
