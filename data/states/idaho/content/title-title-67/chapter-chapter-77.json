(1) Any charitable or nonprofit organization not exempt pursuant to section 67-7713, Idaho Code, desiring to operate bingo sessions or games or charitable raffles shall make application for a license to the state lottery. The state lottery shall review the license application and shall approve or deny the issuing of a license within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the license application. The state lottery may deny the application if it determines that the applicant has not met requirements for an application imposed in this chapter and rules promulgated pursuant to this chapter or upon any ground for which an application for renewal of a license could be denied or for which an existing licensee’s license could be revoked or suspended. Whenever an application is denied, it shall be returned to the applicant by the state lottery with specific reasons for the denial. When a license application is approved by the state lottery, the state lottery shall issue a license to the applicant. No person or charitable or nonprofit organization, except those exempt pursuant to section 67-7713, Idaho Code, shall operate or conduct a bingo session or game or charitable raffle until it has received a license from the state lottery. The license shall expire one (1) year after the date it was issued.\n\n(2) Each application and renewal application shall contain the following information:\n\n(a) The name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number and social security number of the applicant and, if the applicant is a corporation, association or other similar legal entity, the name, home address, date of birth, driver’s license number and social security number of each of the officers of the organization, as well as the name and address of the directors, or other persons similarly situated, of the organization;\n\n(b) The name, home address, date of birth, driver’s license number and social security number of each person or persons responsible for managing the bingo session or game or raffle;\n\n(c) (i) In the case of charitable organizations, a copy of the application for recognition of exemptions and a determination letter from the internal revenue service that indicates the organization is a charitable organization and states the section under which that exemption is granted, except that if the organization is a state or local branch, lodge, post or chapter of a national organization, a copy of the determination letter of the national organization shall satisfy this requirement; and\n\n(ii) In the case of incorporated nonprofit organizations, a copy of a certificate of existence issued by the secretary of state pursuant to chapter 30, title 30, Idaho Code, establishing the organization’s good standing in the state.\n\n(d) The location at which the applicant will conduct the bingo session or games or drawings for the raffles.\n\n(3) The operation of bingo sessions or games or charitable raffles shall be the direct responsibility of, and controlled by, the governing body of the organization and the members of the governing body shall be held responsible for the conduct of the bingo sessions or games or raffles.

An organization shall not contract with any person for the purpose of conducting a bingo session or providing bingo services or conducting a raffle on the organization’s behalf, provided that this prohibition does not prevent a bingo organization from hiring employees and paying wages as provided in section 67-7709(1)(d)(ii), Idaho Code. However, if the state lottery commission has entered into an agreement or contract with another state for the operation or promotion of joint bingo sessions, the charitable or nonprofit organization may participate in that contract or agreement.\n\n(4) Different chapters of an organization may apply for and share one (1) license to conduct raffles as long as the information required in subsection (2) of this section is provided to the lottery prior to the issuance of the license.\n\n(5) The organization may apply for the license to coincide with the organization’s fiscal year.\n\n[(67-7711) 67-7707, added 1993, ch. 391, sec. 2, p. 1452; am. 1994, ch. 281, sec. 5, p. 879; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 350, sec. 10, p. 1158; am. 1996, ch. 382, sec. 7, p. 1300; am. 2000, ch. 340, sec. 9, p. 1142; am. 2008, ch. 43, sec. 3, p. 104; am. 2013, ch. 251, sec. 9, p. 618; am. 2017, ch. 58, sec. 35, p. 131.]",
