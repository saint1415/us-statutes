The taxpayer shall be notified of the assessment of such penalty at the same time as the notice of the assessor’s refusal to grant the exemption in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.\n\n(iv) Any subsequent violation within seven (7) years of an instance pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor, subject to the penalties provided in section 18-113, Idaho Code.

An owner subject to the provisions of this subsection must apply for the exemption with the county assessor every year on or before a deadline date as specified by the county assessor for the county in which the homestead is claimed. If an owner fails to apply on or before the established deadline, the county may, at its discretion, discontinue the exemption for that year.\n\n(9) A homestead that previously qualified for exemption under this section in the preceding year shall not lose such qualification due to the owner’s, beneficiary’s, partner’s, member’s or shareholder’s death during the year of the owner’s, beneficiary’s, partner’s, member’s or shareholder’s death and the tax year immediately following such death, provided that the homestead continues to be a part of the owner’s, beneficiary’s, partner’s, member’s or shareholder’s estate.

The database shall be made accessible to officials listed in subsection (6)(b) of this section for the purpose of verifying that:\n\n(a) Multiple active exemptions have not been claimed by the same person; and\n\n(b) A person’s residence for voting purposes is the same as the homestead for which such person has an active exemption pursuant to this section, if an exemption is so claimed.\n\n63-602G. PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION — HOMESTEAD. [EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2026] (1) For each tax year, the first one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) of the market value for assessment purposes of the homestead as that term is defined in section 63-701, Idaho Code, or fifty percent (50%) of the market value for assessment purposes of the homestead as that term is defined in section 63-701, Idaho Code, whichever is the lesser, shall be exempt from property taxation.\n\n(2) The exemption allowed by this section may be granted only if:\n\n(a) The homestead is owner-occupied and used as the primary dwelling place of the owner. The homestead may consist of part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building and shall include all of such dwelling or building except any portion used exclusively for anything other than the primary dwelling of the owner. The presence of an office in a homestead, which office is used for multiple purposes, including business and personal use, shall not prevent the owner from claiming the exemption provided in this section; and\n\n(b) The state tax commission has certified to the board of county commissioners that all properties in the county subject to appraisal by the county assessor have, in fact, been appraised uniformly so as to secure a just valuation for all property within the county; and\n\n(c) The owner has certified to the county assessor that:\n\n(i) He is making application for the exemption allowed by this section;\n\n(ii) The homestead is his primary dwelling place; and\n\n(iii) He has not made application in any other county for the exemption and has not made application for the exemption on any other homestead in the county.\n\n(d) For the purpose of this section, the definition of \"owner\" shall be the same definition set forth in section 63-701(7), Idaho Code. When an owner, pursuant to the provisions of section 63-701(7), Idaho Code, is any person who is the beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust, or who is a partner of a limited partnership, a member of a limited liability company, or a shareholder of a corporation, he or she may provide proof of the trust, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation in the manner set forth in section 63-703(4), Idaho Code.\n\n(e) Any owner may request in writing the return of all copies of any documents submitted with the affidavit set forth in section 63-703(4), Idaho Code, that are held by a county assessor, and the copies shall be returned by the county assessor upon submission of the affidavit in proper form.\n\n(f) For the purpose of this section, the definition of \"primary dwelling place\" shall be the same definition set forth in section 63-701(8), Idaho Code.\n\n(g) For the purpose of this section, the definition of \"occupied\" shall be the same definition set forth in section 63-701(6), Idaho Code.\n\n(3) The county assessor of each county shall prescribe and make available forms to be used by a homeowner to apply for the homestead exemption provided in this section. The homeowner shall provide on such forms the homeowner’s full name, date of birth, complete address, and most recent previous complete address. The homeowner shall also provide, as applicable, such homeowner’s Idaho state-issued driver’s license number or Idaho state-issued identification card number, except that such requirement shall not apply to a homeowner in active military service for the initial application for the exemption and during such time as the homeowner meets the qualifications provided in subsection (8) of this section. If the homeowner applying for the exemption provided in this section has not been domiciled in Idaho for at least ninety (90) days and does not have an Idaho state-issued driver’s license or Idaho state-issued identification card, the homeowner shall provide an Idaho state-issued driver’s license number or an Idaho state-issued identification card number to the county assessor within ninety (90) days of submitting such homeowner’s initial application for the exemption.\n\n(4) An owner need make application for the exemption described in subsection (1) of this section only once, as long as all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The owner has received the exemption during the previous year as a result of making a valid application as set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section.\n\n(b) The owner or beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder, as appropriate, still occupies the same homestead for which the owner made application.\n\n(c) The homestead described in paragraph (b) of this subsection is owner-occupied or occupied by a beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder, as appropriate, and used as the primary dwelling place of the owner or beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder, as appropriate.\n\n(5)(a) The exemption allowed by this section shall be effective on the date of eligibility status change provided on the approved application for the current tax year and must be taken before the reduction in taxes provided by sections 63-701 through 63-710, Idaho Code, is applied.\n\n(b) If the eligibility status of the property eligible for the exemption changes during the tax year, the property taxes shall be prorated based on the property’s eligibility status during the year. The levy rate shall be multiplied against the market value for assessment purposes of the property, and the resulting tax due shall be divided by three hundred sixty-five (365) days, or by three hundred sixty-six (366) days if the tax year is a leap year, for the daily tax amount and then multiplied by the number of days of the year such property has a given exemption eligibility status. For an owner who qualifies for the homeowner exemption, the property taxes shall be calculated using the market value for assessment purposes, reduced by the exemption amount provided in subsection (1) of this section. The levy rate shall be multiplied against such value and divided by three hundred sixty-five (365) days, or by three hundred sixty-six (366) days if the tax year is a leap year, and then multiplied by the number of days such person is eligible for the exemption.\n\n(c) If the eligibility status of the property changes during the tax year, the taxable value of the homestead or the tax amount shall be adjusted in one (1) of the following ways:\n\n(i) If the property becomes eligible before the second Monday of July, the reduced taxable value shall be entered on the property roll pursuant to section 63-301, Idaho Code, and the homeowner property tax relief roll pursuant to section 63-724(4), Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) If the property becomes eligible on or after the second Monday of July, property taxes due shall be calculated as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and any reduction in property tax will result in a cancellation or refund as provided in section 63-1202, Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) If the property becomes ineligible for the exemption before the second Monday of July, any additional taxable value shall be entered on the property roll pursuant to section 63-301, Idaho Code, and the homeowner property tax relief roll pursuant to section 63-724(4), Idaho Code;\n\n(iv) If the property becomes ineligible for the exemption on or after the second Monday of July but no later than the fourth Monday of November, the additional value shall be assessed and entered on the subsequent or missed property roll pursuant to the provisions of section 63-301, Idaho Code; or\n\n(v) If the property becomes ineligible for the exemption on or after the fourth Monday of November, the tax on the additional value may be calculated as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and billed as provided for the recovery of the property tax exemption pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(6) Recovery of property tax exemptions allowed by this section but improperly claimed or approved:\n\n(a)(i) Prior to granting an exemption, the county assessor shall investigate whether an applicant for the exemption has claimed the exemption for another homestead and shall not grant the exemption where it appears the exemption has been improperly claimed. The applicant shall be notified of the county assessor’s refusal to grant the exemption.\n\n(ii) Upon discovery of evidence, facts or circumstances indicating any exemption allowed by this section was improperly claimed or approved, the county assessor shall decide whether the exemption claimed should have been allowed and, if not, notify the taxpayer in writing, assess a recovery of property tax and notify the county treasurer of this assessment. If the county assessor determined that an exemption was improperly approved as a result of county error, the county assessor shall present the discovered evidence, facts or circumstances from the improperly approved exemption to the board of county commissioners, at which time the board may waive a recovery of the property tax and notify such taxpayer in writing.\n\n(iii) Upon the first instance of a taxpayer being discovered to have claimed more than one (1) homestead exemption, the taxpayer shall be subject to a penalty, payable to the county treasurer, in an amount equal to the amount of property tax recovered pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, which shall be paid in addition to such recovery amount. The taxpayer shall be notified of the assessment of such penalty at the same time as the notice of the assessor’s refusal to grant the exemption in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.\n\n(iv) Any subsequent violation within seven (7) years of an instance pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor, subject to the penalties provided in section 18-113, Idaho Code. The county assessor shall notify the county prosecuting attorney of any conduct that would constitute a misdemeanor pursuant to this subparagraph.\n\n(v) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a taxpayer from claiming a homestead exemption after January 1 for a property that is not already subject to the homestead exemption, provided any claim for an exemption is consistent with the requirements of subsection (2)(c)(iii) of this section.\n\n(b) Upon request by a county assessor conducting an investigation under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or when information indicating that an improper claim for the exemption allowed by this section is discovered by the state tax commission, the state tax commission shall disclose relevant information to the appropriate county assessor, board of county commissioners, county clerk, and county treasurer and to the secretary of state.

The provisions of section 63-602Y, Idaho Code, shall not apply to the exemption provided by this subsection. The exemption provided by this subsection applies only to improvements to real property, and only until first occupied.

To qualify for credit or direct payment the person or organization at the point of delivery must also be the person or organization pumping water for irrigation purposes and not a distributor or redistributor of electrical power or natural gas energy.\n\n(4) For the purposes of determining the benefit to which each consumer is entitled by virtue of this exemption, the following procedure is provided.\n\nTo receive the benefit of the exemption under section 63-602O, Idaho Code, and this section, each consumer who is not a customer of the deliverer of electrical power or gas energy must file an application with the state tax commission on or before April 30 each year except that for the year 1993, only such application may be filed on or before June 15. The state tax commission shall prescribe by rule the form and information necessary for such application.\n\nOn or before the fifteenth day of November each year, the tax collector of each county shall transmit to the state tax commission, duplicate tax statements of each utility, showing the property taxes payable by such utility in his county. The state tax commission shall as soon as practicable thereafter, certify to each utility, the aggregate saving in property taxes effected in the several counties to each utility by reason of this exemption. On or before the fifteenth day of December of each year, each utility shall file with the state tax commission of Idaho, a statement showing the revenues which were or are to be collected from each irrigation or drainage pumping consumer, and the ratio between the aggregate savings in property taxes certified to it by the state tax commission and the aggregate revenues which were or are to be collected from these consumers. The utility shall determine the credit to which each consumer is entitled by virtue of this exemption and shall certify to the state tax commission that it has refunded or credited against the consumer’s bills, the amounts due each consumer. This refund or credit shall equal each consumer’s bill for the year multiplied by the ratio calculated pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. The public utilities commission shall have jurisdiction under the public utilities law to insure utility compliance with the provisions of this statute.\n\n[63-603 added 1996, ch. 98, sec. 7, p. 359.]",
