Title to all machinery, buildings, lands, and property of every kind and nature, belonging to a dissolved district shall immediately upon dissolution be vested in the board of county commissioners as custodians thereof; and thereafter as soon as may be practical the board shall dispose of the same. If the county and/or any incorporated cities are to continue providing the services formerly provided by the dissolved district, then the county commissioners and officials from such cities shall estimate the value of all such property and said property shall be transferred to any cities providing services formerly provided by the dissolved district in direct proportion to the portion of the dissolving districts’ total valuation for the preceding calendar year which is located within the city or cities, with the remaining portion of the property going to the county. If the county commissioners and officials from such cities determine that it is advantageous to dispose of the property at public or private sale, all funds arising from such sale or sales shall be deposited in the county treasury in a separate fund, together with other moneys belonging to such district, to be maintained by the treasurer, and from which debts of and claims against said districts shall be paid as hereinafter provided. All funds in the treasury of such district shall be delivered by the treasurer thereof to the treasurer of such county and deposited in a special fund, and all moneys thereafter accruing to such districts from collection of taxes and assessments levied or assessed prior to such dissolution, and all moneys belonging to such district from any source, shall likewise be placed in such special fund. Following the payment of debts and claims against such district, any moneys remaining in such special fund shall be distributed to any incorporated cities located within the boundaries of such district which are providing services formerly provided by such district in proportion to the portion of the total valuation of such district which is located within such cities. All remaining moneys after distribution to such cities shall be transferred to the current expense fund of the county.\n\nIf such district is located in more than one (1) county, then all authority vested in the county commissioners under this section shall be vested jointly in the several commissioners; provided, however, that any special fund established for the deposit of moneys accruing to such district shall be established in the treasury of the county which contains the greatest portion of the preceding year’s valuation of the dissolved district and any property or moneys to be transferred to a county current expense fund shall be distributed to the counties in proportion to the portion of the valuation of the district which is located within each county but not including the valuation of any incorporated city which is providing services formerly provided by such district.\n\n[63-4105, added 1987, ch. 87, sec. 1, p. 166.]",
