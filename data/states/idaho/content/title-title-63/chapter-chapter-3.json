In this case, the amount added to the new construction roll will equal eighty percent (80%) of the amount by which the increment value in the year immediately preceding the year in which the de-annexation described in this subsection occurs exceeds the incremental value as of December 31, 2006, or, for revenue allocation areas formed after December 31, 2006, the entire increment value within the area subject to the de-annexation.\n\n(k) In the case of a fire protection district or ambulance service district that encompasses all or part of any urban renewal revenue allocation area that such district withdrew from pursuant to section 50-2906(5), Idaho Code, eighty percent (80%) of the increment value may be included on the new construction roll for the year in which the district withdrew from such urban renewal revenue allocation area. Each year thereafter, ninety percent (90%) of the taxable value of otherwise qualifying new construction shall be included in the new construction roll for such fire protection district or ambulance service district, even if such new construction would not otherwise qualify because it was located within a revenue allocation area.\n\n(4) The amount of taxable market value of new construction shall be the change in net taxable market value that is attributable directly to the new construction or loss of the exemption provided by section 63-602W(3) or (4), Idaho Code. It shall not include any change in value of existing property that is due to external market forces such as general or localized inflation, except as provided in subsection (3)(f) of this section.\n\n(5) The amount of taxable market value of new construction shall not include any new construction of property that has been granted a provisional property tax exemption, pursuant to section 63-1305C, Idaho Code.

(1) It shall be the duty of the county assessor of each county in the state to conduct and carry out a continuing program of valuation of all taxable properties under his jurisdiction pursuant to such rules as the state tax commission may prescribe, to the end that all parcels of property under the assessor’s jurisdiction are assessed at current market value. In order to promote uniform assessment of property in the state of Idaho, taxable property shall be appraised or indexed annually to reflect current market value. In order to achieve this goal, all taxable property in a county shall be appraised at least once every five (5) years, except as provided in subsection (6). Beginning in 2003, or year one (1) of any five (5) year cycle not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the taxable properties in the county shall be appraised during that year; by the end of year two (2) not less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous year; by the end of year three (3) not less than fifty-five percent (55%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous two (2) years; by the end of year four (4) not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the taxable properties in the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous three (3) years; and by the end of year five (5) all one hundred percent (100%) of the taxable properties within the county shall have been appraised during that year and the previous four (4) years. Annually, all taxable property, not appraised that year, shall be indexed to reflect current market value for assessment purposes using market value property transactions and results of the annual appraisal of taxable property. The county assessor shall maintain in the respective offices sufficient records to show when each parcel or item of property was last appraised. The appraisal required by this section shall include a plan outlining the continuing valuation program. Said plan shall be submitted to the state tax commission for approval on or before the first Monday in February, 1997, and no less frequently than every fifth year thereafter. The state tax commission shall not approve any plan that fails to provide for adequate appraisal and valuation of all taxable properties in any county.\n\n(2) The state tax commission is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to promulgate rules for the implementation of this program, and to provide any such county assessor with such supervision and technical assistance as may be necessary.\n\n(3) The county commissioners of each county shall furnish the assessor with such additional funds and personnel as may be required to carry out the program hereby provided, and for this purpose may levy annually a property tax of not to exceed four-hundredths percent (.04%) of the market value for assessment purposes on all taxable property in the county to be collected and paid into the county treasury and appropriated to the property valuation fund which is hereby created.\n\n(4) If compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) is not obtained, or if any county fails to meet the goals set in subsection (1), the state tax commission may proceed as required by section 63-316, Idaho Code. If a county fails to meet the timelines in subsection (1), the state tax commission shall require a remediation plan.\n\n(5) As used in this section the term \"adequate appraisal and valuation of all taxable properties in any county\" means a process which includes a field inspection of not less than the number of taxable properties necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (1). Appraisal also includes collection, verification and analysis of market value sales, applicable income and expense data and building cost information, and application of this information to predict market value.\n\n(6) The board of county commissioners may request that the Idaho state tax commission grant an extension of the five (5) year reappraisal deadline set forth in subsection (1). The request shall be in writing and shall set forth the reason(s) that the county is unable to complete the reappraisal process as required by subsection (1) and shall set forth the measures the county will undertake in order to complete the reappraisal program within the extension of time requested. In no case shall an extension exceed two (2) years. The state tax commission may approve or deny any request for an extension and shall notify the board of county commissioners of its decision in writing. The state tax commission shall not approve any extension absent a showing by the county of extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances may include, but are not limited to, natural disasters or unforeseen circumstances that result in extreme financial hardship to the county. Circumstances that will not qualify for an extension may include, but are not limited to, failure to adequately fund the county valuation program as provided by this section, malfeasance, or mismanagement by a current elected official. The state tax commission shall not grant the extension provided in this section if studies conducted by the commission indicate that any category of property affected by such extension is not assessed at market value.\n\n(7) The Idaho state tax commission shall report back to the Idaho house of representatives revenue and taxation committee and the senate local government and taxation committee whenever an extension authorized under subsection (6) is granted.\n\n[63-314, added 1996, ch. 98, sec. 4, p. 333; am. 1997, ch. 117, sec. 14, p. 314; am. 2000, ch. 196, sec. 1, p. 487; am. 2003, ch. 34, sec. 1, p. 152.]",

Improvements, other than additions to existing improvements, constructed upon real property shall not be subject to property taxation during the year of construction other than that portion actually in place as of January 1 of each calendar year. New manufactured housing shall not be subject to property taxation during the first year of occupancy if occupied after January 1. For the purposes of this section, \"new manufactured housing\" means manufactured housing, whether real or personal, never previously occupied.\n\n(2) There is hereby levied an occupancy tax upon all newly constructed and occupied residential, commercial and industrial structures, including new manufactured housing, except additions to existing improvements or manufactured housing, prorated for the portion of the year for which the structure was occupied. The occupancy tax shall be upon those improvements or new manufactured housing for that portion of the calendar year in which first occupancy occurs. The occupancy tax does not apply to operating property. Improvements that were exempt as of January 1 of the tax year, but that may be subject to occupancy tax during that tax year, shall not be subject to property tax as otherwise provided in section 63-602Y, Idaho Code.

As soon as practical after receiving such a report, the county assessor shall appraise and determine the market value for assessment purposes.\n\n(a) At the time the county assessor determines the market value for assessment purposes of any improvement, he shall allow as an offset against the market value of the improvement the market value of any portion of that improvement which was existing on January 1 and placed upon the property roll.\n\n(b) Upon completion of the appraisal and entry of the appraised value on the occupancy tax roll, which roll shall be prepared for property subject to the occupancy tax, the county assessor shall:\n\n(i) Notify the owner of the appraised value and the right to appeal the value provided in the appraisal within twenty-eight (28) days of such notification in the manner provided in section 63-501A, Idaho Code, notwithstanding date limitations found in that section, and further shall notify the owner of the right to apply for the exemption provided in sections 63-602G and 63-602X, Idaho Code.
