The return shall report all taxes due regarding cigarettes received during the month or other reporting period, approved by the state tax commission, to which the return relates. The return shall contain such other information as the state tax commission shall require, and shall be signed by the person required to file the return or by such person’s duly authorized agent. The return shall be filed on or before the twentieth day of the month following the end of the taxable period to which the return relates.\n\n(3) The amount allowed as compensation for affixing stamps under section 63-2509, Idaho Code, shall be separately stated on the return as a credit against taxes due on the return.\n\n(4) In addition to reporting the tax due as provided in this section, the return shall provide an accounting of all cigarette stamps acquired, held, and affixed by the wholesaler. The return shall include:\n\n(a) The number of stamps which were held at the beginning of the reporting period and were not affixed to packages;\n\n(b) The number of stamps acquired during the reporting period;\n\n(c) The number of stamps affixed to packages during the reporting period;\n\n(d) The number of unaffixed stamps held at the end of the reporting period; and\n\n(e) The number, if any, of stamps lost or destroyed. If stamps are lost or destroyed, a statement describing the circumstances giving rise to the loss or destruction shall accompany the return.\n\n(5) In the event that any stamps obtained by a wholesaler are lost, destroyed, or otherwise unaccounted for, the wholesaler shall be liable for an amount of tax equal to the tax on the number of cigarettes to which such stamps would have been affixed, unless the wholesaler can establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that a specific number of stamps were actually destroyed or mutilated in such a manner as to render them unusable.\n\n(6) In the event that a wholesaler or any other person in possession of unused cigarette stamps shall cease doing business as a wholesaler of cigarettes, such wholesaler or other person shall return all unused stamps to the state tax commission or shall be liable for an amount of tax equal to the tax on the number of cigarettes to which such stamps would have been affixed.\n\n(7) A wholesaler may claim a credit against taxes due on the tax return for taxes previously paid on cigarettes, which after stamps are affixed, become unmarketable and are returned to the manufacturer.

(1) At the time an application for a wholesaler’s license or permit, under section 63-2503, Idaho Code, is submitted to the state tax commission, the applicant shall file a bond, in such form as the commission may determine, conditioned upon faithful performance of all of the requirements of this chapter. The total amount of the bond shall be fixed by the commission and shall be the greater of twice the estimated average tax liability for the reporting period for which the applicant will be required to file a return, under section 63-2510, Idaho Code, or the value of stamps in the wholesaler’s inventory including the value of stamps ordered but not yet received. The total amount required to be secured by the bond may be increased or reduced by the commission at any time. Any bond given in conjunction with the provisions of this section shall be a continuing instrument, and shall cover the period during which the license or permit in connection with which the bond is given is in effect, unless the surety on the bond is released or discharged by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a wholesaler shall be discharged only by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a wholesaler shall be discharged and released by the commission from, any and all, liability to the state, accruing on the bond after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date upon which the surety shall have lodged with the commission a written request to be released and discharged. The request shall not operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from any liability accrued, or which will accrue, before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. The commission shall promptly, upon receipt of the notice of the request, notify the wholesaler and require him to furnish a new bond. Unless the wholesaler files a new bond with the commission in the amount provided in this section before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the commission shall immediately cancel the wholesaler’s license or permit.\n\n(2) In the event that any taxes due under the provisions of this chapter are not paid by a wholesaler, and the unpaid taxes are assessed by the commission, and after all avenues for appeal of the assessment have been exhausted, the commission may apply the unpaid tax liability against the bond required in this section.\n\n(3) A wholesaler may pay full value for stamps in advance in lieu of posting a bond. A wholesaler that has posted a bond may petition for release from the bond requirement after having filed timely and fully paid cigarette tax returns, as provided in section 63-2510, Idaho Code, for a period of not less than twelve (12) months. Upon such petition from the wholesaler, the commission will review the cigarette tax return filing and payment record of the wholesaler and, if determined necessary, within sixty (60) days examine the books and records of the wholesaler. The commission will, no later than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the petition, advise the wholesaler in writing of its determination and the reasons therefor. If the wholesaler wishes to seek a redetermination of the commission’s decision, a petition for redetermination may be filed as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) If at any time after release of a bond requirement the wholesaler becomes delinquent for any period in the filing of tax returns or the payment of the tax as required in section 63-2510, Idaho Code, the commission may make immediate demand that the return be filed or the payment be tendered and that a bond be filed as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. Any wholesaler against whom such demand is made may petition for a redetermination as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, except that the petition must be filed no later than ten (10) days after service upon the person of notice thereof. If a petition for redetermination is not filed within the ten (10) day period, the determination shall become final and the commission shall issue a jeopardy assessment as provided in section 63-3630, Idaho Code, and thereafter may:\n\n(a) Seize all Idaho cigarette stamps in the possession of the wholesaler which are not applied to cigarettes;\n\n(b) File a lien of record upon the cigarettes held in inventory by the wholesaler or seize such cigarettes;\n\n(c) Revoke the wholesaler’s cigarette permit as provided in section 63-2503, Idaho Code, except that no notice or hearing shall be required; and\n\n(d) Notify the manufacturers of the cigarettes held in inventory by the wholesaler of any or all actions so taken.\n\n(5) A wholesaler who acquires all cigarettes with tax stamps affixed at the time of acquisition may petition the state tax commission for waiver of the bond required in subsection (1) of this section. Upon receipt of evidence establishing that the wholesaler is not required to pay cigarette taxes under this chapter because the wholesaler exclusively purchases cigarettes with stamps affixed by another wholesaler, the state tax commission may waive the requirement for a bond. Any such waiver is conditioned upon the wholesaler’s continuing qualification for the waiver under this subsection.\n\n[63-2510A, added 1988, ch. 224, sec. 3, p. 430; am. 1990, ch. 41, sec. 1, p. 64; am. 1992, ch. 49, sec. 4, p. 153; am. 2006, ch. 60, sec. 6, p. 189; am. 2016, ch. 28, sec. 1, p. 69.]",

Such tax shall be imposed at the time the distributor:\n\n(a) Brings, or causes to be brought, into this state from without the state tobacco products for sale;\n\n(b) Makes, manufactures, or fabricates tobacco products in this state for sale in this state; or\n\n(c) Ships or transports tobacco products to retailers in this state to be sold by those retailers.\n\n(2) Fifty percent (50%) of the tax collected pursuant to this section shall be subject to appropriation to the public school income fund to be utilized to develop and implement school safety improvements and to facilitate and provide substance abuse prevention programs in the public school system and the Idaho bureau of educational services for the deaf and the blind, less two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) that shall be remitted annually to the Idaho state police to increase toxicology lab capacity in the bureau of forensic services for drug testing of juveniles, and less eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) that shall be remitted to the commission on Hispanic affairs to be used for substance abuse prevention efforts in collaboration with the state department of education. Fifty percent (50%) of the tax collected pursuant to this section shall be subject to appropriation to the department of juvenile corrections for distribution quarterly to the counties to be utilized for county juvenile probation services, based on the percentage the population of the county bears to the population of the state as a whole. The moneys remitted to the Idaho state police shall be reviewed annually and any money in excess to the operations needs of the laboratory for juvenile drug testing will be deposited in the public school income fund for substance abuse prevention programs in the public school system. The laboratory may utilize this increased toxicology capacity for adult drug testing to the extent that timely testing for juveniles is not adversely impacted.\n\n[63-2552A, added 1994, ch. 447, sec. 3, p. 1432; am. 1995, ch. 160, sec. 2, p. 638; am. 1995, ch. 368, sec. 3, p. 1283; repealed 1995, ch. 368, sec. 4, p. 1283; new section added 1995, ch. 368, sec. 6, p. 1284; am. 1996, ch. 261, sec. 4, p. 861; am. 1996, ch. 261, sec. 5, p. 861; am. 1997, ch. 268, sec. 5, p. 771; am. 2000, ch. 469, sec. 131, p. 1593; am. 2014, ch. 325, sec. 2, p. 808; am. 2018, ch. 94, sec. 2, p. 202; am. 2023, ch. 291, sec. 2, p. 882.]",
