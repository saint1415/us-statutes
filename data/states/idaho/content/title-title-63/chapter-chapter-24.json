The tax shall be imposed without regard to whether use is on a governmental basis or otherwise, unless exempted by this chapter.\n\n(2) The tax imposed in this section shall be at the rate of thirty-two cents (32¢) per gallon of motor fuel received. This tax shall be subject to the exemptions, deductions and refunds set forth in this chapter.\n\n(3) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the distributor who is liable for payment of the tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section from including as part of the selling price an amount equal to such tax on motor fuels sold or delivered by such distributor; provided however, that nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impose tax liability on any person to whom such fuel is sold or delivered except as provided in subsection (6) of this section.\n\n(4) Any person coming into this state in a motor vehicle may transport in the manufacturer’s original tank of that vehicle, for his own use only, not more than thirty (30) gallons of motor fuel for the purpose of operating that motor vehicle, without complying with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(5) The tax imposed in this section does not apply to:\n\n(a) Special fuels that have been dyed at a refinery or terminal under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. section 4082 and regulations adopted thereunder, or under the clean air act and regulations adopted thereunder; or\n\n(b) Special fuels that are gaseous special fuels, as defined in section 63-2424, Idaho Code, except that part thereof that is delivered into the fuel supply tank or tanks of a motor vehicle or certain gaseous special fuels bulk tanks.

Such distributor shall retain the administrative obligation to remit the tax, and such obligation shall accrue upon receipt in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Should a retailer otherwise subject to the tax be exempt from imposition of the tax as a matter of federal law, by virtue of its status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or member of such tribe, the retailer shall not bear the tax’s legal incidence and must pass the tax through as part of the selling price of the fuel to the consumer, unless such consumer is exempt from imposition of the tax as a matter of federal law, by virtue of its status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or membership in such tribe, and the retailer shall be entitled to claim a credit against taxes otherwise due and owing under this chapter or a tax refund, together with interest, attributable to the fuel purchased by such consumer.\n\n[63-2402, added 1983, ch. 158, sec. 4, p. 443; am. 2002, ch. 174, sec. 2, p. 509; am. 2007, ch. 288, sec. 1, p. 817; am. 2015, ch. 38, sec. 2, p. 81; am. 2015, ch. 175, sec. 1, p. 573; am. 2015, ch. 341, sec. 4, p. 1282; am. 2018, ch. 80, sec. 2, p. 181.]",

Such credit or refund shall include interest at the rate established in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, computed from sixty (60) days following the later of the due date of the claimed refund under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection or the filing of the claim. No refund will be paid under this section unless a written claim for such refund has been filed with the commission within three (3) years after the due date, including extensions, of the income tax return in regard to which the claim relates or the due date of the claim established in paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(d) The commission may require that all claims be accompanied by the original signed invoice or invoices issued to the claimant, showing the total amount of gasoline on which a refund is claimed and the reason, the amount of the tax and any additional information required by the commission. Each separate delivery shall constitute a purchase and a separate invoice shall be prepared, at least in duplicate, to cover the delivery. All invoices, except those prepared by a computer or similar machine, shall be prepared in ink, or double-spaced carbon shall be used between the original and first duplicate.\n\n(6) (a) Should the commission find that the claim contains errors, it may correct the claim and approve it as corrected, or the commission may require the claimant to file an amended claim. The commission may require any person who makes a claim for refund to furnish a statement under oath, giving his occupation, description of the machine or equipment in which the gasoline was used, the place where used and any other information as the commission may require. If the commission determines that any claim has been fraudulently presented, or is supported by an invoice or invoices fraudulently made or altered, or that any statement in the claim or affidavit is willfully false and made for the purpose of misleading, the commission may reject the claim in full. If the claim is rejected, the commission may suspend the claimant’s right to any refund for purchases made during a period not to exceed one (1) year beginning with the date the rejected claim was filed, and it shall take all other action deemed appropriate.\n\n(b) The commission has authority, in order to establish the validity of any claim, to examine the books and records of the claimant for that purpose, and failure of the claimant to accede to the demand for the examination may constitute a waiver of all rights to the refund claimed.\n\n(7) In the event of the loss or destruction of the original invoice or invoices, the person claiming a refund may submit a duplicate copy of the invoice certified by the vendor, but payment based on the duplicate invoice shall not be made until one (1) year after the date on which the gasoline was purchased.\n\n[63-2410, added 1983, ch. 158, sec. 4, p. 446; am. 1986, ch. 175, sec. 1, p. 465; am. 1993, ch. 47, sec. 4, p. 123; am. 1995, ch. 132, sec. 5, p. 570; am. 1995, ch. 348, sec. 2, p. 1145; am. 1998, ch. 196, sec. 1, p. 707; am. 2001, ch. 104, sec. 2, p. 345; am. 2002, ch. 30, sec. 4, p. 41; am. 2004, ch. 235, sec. 2, p. 696; am. 2015, ch. 35, sec. 1, p. 73; am. 2018, ch. 81, sec. 1, p. 183.]",

(1) At the time an application for a motor fuel distributor license under section 63-2427A, Idaho Code, is submitted to the commission, the applicant shall file a bond with the commission conditioned upon faithful performance of all of the requirements of this chapter. The total amount of the bond shall be fixed by the commission and shall be equivalent to at least twice the estimated average tax liability for the reporting period for which the applicant will be required to file a distributor’s report under section 63-2406, Idaho Code. The bond required by this section shall in no case be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). Based on prior years’ experience, the total amount required to be secured by the bond may be increased or reduced by the commission at any time. The bond will be waived if the commission is satisfied that the distributor has the financial responsibility to meet the required bond amount. Financial responsibility may be determined by the commission upon review of all relevant public documents including appropriate county records and records of tax payments to the state of Idaho. The distributor can be required to provide a commercial credit rating, balance sheet, or income statement to demonstrate present financial solvency, i.e. ownership of real and/or personal property, the unencumbered value of which exceeds the bond amount otherwise required. If such financial solvency is established, and if the distributor has been doing business in Idaho as a licensed distributor for five (5) or more consecutive years without a default in the payment of taxes imposed in this chapter, financial responsibility shall be presumed. Any bond given in conjunction with this chapter shall be a continuing instrument, and shall cover the period during which the license in connection with which the bond is given is in effect, unless the surety on the bond is released or discharged by the commission. Any surety on any bond furnished by a licensee shall be discharged and released from any and all liability to the state accruing on the bond after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date upon which the surety shall have lodged with the commission a written request to be released and discharged. The request shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from any liability accrued, or which will accrue, before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. The commission shall promptly, upon receipt of the notice of the request, notify the licensee and require him to furnish a new bond. Unless the licensee files a new bond with the commission in the amount provided in this section before the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the commission shall immediately cancel the licensee’s license.\n\n(2) In the event that any taxes due under the provisions of this chapter are not paid by a licensed distributor, and the unpaid taxes are assessed by the commission, and after all avenues for appeal of the assessment have been exhausted, the commission may apply the unpaid tax liability against the bond required by this section.\n\n[63-2428, added 1983, ch. 158, sec. 4, p. 452; am. 1988, ch. 231, sec. 1, p. 445; am. 1995, ch. 132, sec. 10, p. 574; am. 1998, ch. 103, sec. 9, p. 359; am. 2015, ch. 38, sec. 8, p. 85.]",

      "text": "63-2470. ENFORCEMENT OF LICENSING PROVISIONS. (1) A licensee may cancel his license at any time without prejudice, unless the commission has issued a notice of revocation letter to the licensee. If the licensee cancels his license after receiving a notice of revocation, then the cancellation will be treated as a revocation.\n\n(2) All licenses issued under this chapter may be held only by persons actively engaged in activities requiring a license under this chapter. Any person not so engaged shall surrender his license to the commission for cancellation. A person is actively engaged in activities requiring a license under this chapter when such person is:\n\n(a) A distributor:\n\n(i) Purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring motor fuel or other petroleum products or gaseous fuel decals; or\n\n(ii) Reporting receipts, disbursements or other transactions subject to the motor fuel tax, transfer fee or gaseous fuel decals;\n\n(b) An international fuel tax agreement (IFTA) licensee accruing reportable distance and fuel use in any IFTA jurisdiction. The IFTA licensee is not actively engaged in these activities when the requirements for cancellation or denial of renewal are met according to the IFTA articles of agreement, article III, section R345, license renewal (revised July 2013).\n\n(3) A license authorized under this chapter may be denied, revoked or suspended when:\n\n(a) The licensee or applicant fails to comply with the motor fuels laws of this state or any other jurisdiction; or\n\n(b) The licensee does not maintain any required bond; or\n\n(c) The licensee is not actively engaged in the activities identified in subsection (2) of this section for twelve (12) consecutive months.\n\n(4) An IFTA licensee may appeal the denial, cancellation or revocation of an IFTA license following the procedure in the IFTA articles of agreement, article XIV (revised July 2013). The decision of the state tax commission is final and must be issued pursuant to section 63-3045B, Idaho Code, using a thirty (30) day appeal period.\n\n(5) When the state tax commission decides to deny, cancel or revoke a distributor license, it shall immediately notify the person of that decision at the person’s last known address. The notice must be accompanied by an explanation of the specific reason for the decision and the right to appeal the decision. Within sixty-three (63) days after the notice is mailed, the person may file a protest in writing requesting a review of the decision. The appeal must contain legal or factual reasons why the person disagrees with the decision. The person may not make any proceedings at court or other action until the appeal rights relating to the decision have become final.\n\n(6) The decision of the state tax commission is final and must be issued pursuant to section 63-3045B, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) The distributor may only appeal the denial of a properly completed application. When any of the required information is not provided, the state tax commission may consider the application incomplete and request additional information, return the application or deny the application.\n\n(8) A person will not be issued a distributor license after one has previously been revoked, unless the state tax commission is satisfied that the former holder of the license will comply with all the requirements of this chapter and correct any other violations of this chapter upon which the revocation was based. All bonding requirements for the reinstated licensee must be met. A bond waiver may not be requested for five (5) years after the reinstatement of the license. A reinstated distributor’s bond is not subject to the maximum bonding limits in section 63-2428, Idaho Code, but may not exceed the estimated tax liability for six (6) months.\n\n(9) When a license is revoked within one (1) year of a previous revocation, there is no right to appeal the second revocation.\n\n[63-2470, added 2015, ch. 38, sec. 16, p. 87.]",
