Any taxing district shall have power from time to time by resolution to borrow money and issue revenue anticipation bonds or notes, bearing interest at such rate as may be determined by the governing board, and maturing not more than one (1) year from the date thereof, for the purpose of providing funds in anticipation of the collection of taxes of the current fiscal year, in anticipation of the distribution of state appropriated funds, and in anticipation of other revenues of any nature, for the year in which said revenue anticipation bonds or notes are issued, exclusive of taxes required to be raised to pay the principal of outstanding bonded indebtedness of the taxing district, the proceeds of such bonds or notes to be used for the purpose for which said taxes are levied or such funds or other revenues are appropriated. The amount authorized to be borrowed by means of such revenue anticipation bonds or notes shall not exceed seventy-five per cent (75%) of the taxes levied for the current fiscal year and not yet collected by said taxing district, seventy-five per cent (75%) of the anticipated distribution from the public school income fund not yet collected for the current fiscal year, and seventy-five per cent (75%) of other revenues anticipated, as shown by the budget duly adopted by the taxing district and certified in accordance with section 63-804, Idaho Code, and not yet collected for the fiscal year. If the tax levy or budget for any fiscal year has not been completed, then the amount of revenue anticipation bonds or notes issued in anticipation of taxes, state funds, or other revenues to be levied for such fiscal year shall not exceed seventy-five per cent (75%) of the taxes levied or state funds or other revenues received by said taxing district in the previous fiscal year. In determining the amount of revenue anticipation bonds or notes which may be issued, the governing body shall declare in the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or notes the amount of taxes levied or state funds or other revenues anticipated for the current fiscal year and the amount of such taxes or state funds or other revenues anticipated not yet collected by said taxing district, or in the event that the tax levy or budget for the fiscal year has not been completed, the governing authority shall declare in the resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue anticipation bonds or notes the amount of taxes levied or state funds or other revenues received by said taxing district in the previous fiscal year. In each instance, taxes raised or to be raised to pay the principal of outstanding bonded indebtedness of the taxing district shall not be included in the amount of taxes or state funds or other revenues anticipated against which such revenue anticipation bonds or notes are authorized to be issued. Such revenue anticipation bonds or notes shall be negotiable instruments, and the full faith, credit and resources of the taxing district shall be pledged for the payment of the same.
