However, do not add any capital loss deducted if a corporation, including any corporation in a group of corporations combined under section 63-3027(22), Idaho Code, was transacting business in Idaho during the taxable year in which the loss was incurred.

Gains treated as ordinary income by the Internal Revenue Code do not qualify for the deduction allowed in this section. The deduction otherwise allowable under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any federal capital gains deduction relating to such property, but not below zero.\n\n(3) Property held by an estate, trust, S corporation, partnership, limited liability company or an individual is \"qualified property\" under this section if the property had an Idaho situs at the time of sale and is:\n\n(a) Real property held at least twelve (12) months;\n\n(b) Tangible personal property used in Idaho for at least twelve (12) months by a revenue-producing enterprise;\n\n(c) Cattle or horses held for breeding, draft, dairy or sporting purposes for at least twenty-four (24) months in Idaho;\n\n(d) Breeding livestock other than cattle or horses held at least twelve (12) months in Idaho;\n\n(e) Timber grown in Idaho and held at least twenty-four (24) months;\n\n(f) A partnership interest, other than a publicly traded partnership as defined by section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, held by an individual for at least twelve (12) months, but only to the extent the gain from sale or exchange of the interest is attributable to real property held by the partnership that is classified as a capital asset by section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code and is qualified real property under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

(1) For nonresident individuals, trusts, or estates the term \"Idaho taxable income\" includes only those components of Idaho taxable income as computed for a resident which are derived from or related to sources within Idaho. This is to be computed without the deductions for either the standard deduction or itemized deductions or personal exemptions except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\n\n(2) For part-year resident individuals, trusts or estates the term \"Idaho taxable income\" includes the total of: (a) Idaho taxable income as computed for a resident for the portion of the tax period during which a taxpayer is domiciled in or is residing in Idaho, plus (b) those components of Idaho taxable income which are derived from or related to sources within Idaho for that portion of the tax period during which a taxpayer is not domiciled in and is not residing in Idaho. This is to be computed without the deductions for either the standard deduction or itemized deductions or personal exemptions except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\n\n(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section:\n\n(a) Income shall be considered derived from or relating to sources within Idaho when such income is attributable to or resulting from:\n\n(i) Any business, trade, profession or occupation conducted or carried on in this state, including the distributive share of partnership income and deductions, and the pro rata share of S corporation income and deductions. Partnership income, including guaranteed payments pursuant to section 707 of the Internal Revenue Code, is sourced to Idaho based upon the Idaho apportionment factor of the partnership; excluding:\n\n1. Guaranteed payment to a retired partner per 4 U.S.C. section 114(b)(1)(I) that is sourced to the recipient’s state of domicile;\n\n2. Guaranteed payment to an individual partner up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in any calendar year is sourced as compensation for services. The amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) is sourced to Idaho based upon the partnership’s Idaho apportionment factor. The two hundred fifty thousand dollar ($250,000) amount will be adjusted annually by multiplying the amount by the percentage (the consumer price index for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year to which the adjusted amount will apply divided by the consumer price index for calendar year 2013) as defined in section 63-3024, Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) The ownership or disposition of any interest in real or tangible personal property located in this state;\n\n(iii) The ownership or disposition of any interest in intangible personal property only to the extent that such property is employed in a business, trade, profession or occupation conducted or carried on in this state. Provided however, that interest income from an installment sale of real or tangible personal property shall constitute income from sources within this state to the extent that the property sold was located within this state. Provided further, that interest income received by a partner or shareholder of a partnership or S corporation from such partnership or S corporation shall constitute income from sources within this state to the extent that the partnership or S corporation is transacting business within this state;\n\n(iv) A resident estate or trust; provided however, that income distributed to beneficiaries of an estate or trust shall constitute income from sources within this state only to the extent the income would be Idaho source income if such income had been received directly by a nonresident individual;\n\n(v) A nonresident estate or trust to the extent the income and deductions of the nonresident estate or trust were derived from or related to sources within this state;\n\n(vi) The conduct of pari-mutuel wagering, charitable gaming or any other form of gambling taking place within this state, except as expressly limited in section 67-7439, Idaho Code;\n\n(vii) Gains or losses realized from the sale or other disposition of a partnership interest or stock in an S corporation to the extent of the partnership’s or S corporation’s Idaho apportionment factor in the taxable year immediately preceding the year of sale. In the case of a nonresident individual who sells the nonresident’s interest in a publicly traded partnership defined in section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code doing business in Idaho, the gains or losses shall be determined using the amount described in section 751 of the Internal Revenue Code, multiplied by the apportionment factor for the year in which the sale occurred.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3)(a) of this section, transactions and investments made, placed or directed by Idaho resident registered broker-dealers and investment advisers or institutions exempt from registration under the Idaho securities act in securities listed with or through the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange registered with the United States securities and exchange commission and approved by the director of the department of finance which generate dividends, interest, capital gains or similar profits or returns for nonresidents not otherwise subject to Idaho income taxation shall not result in the intangible property being deemed to have a situs outside the domicile of the owner.\n\n(c) Nonresident individuals shall not be taxable on investment income from a qualified investment partnership. For purposes of this paragraph, a \"qualified investment partnership\" means a partnership, as defined in section 63-3006B, Idaho Code, that derives at least ninety percent (90%) of its gross income from investments that produce income that would not be taxable to a nonresident individual if the investment were held by that individual.\n\n(d) Compensation paid by the United States for active service in the armed forces of the United States, performed by an individual not domiciled in this state, shall not constitute income derived from or related to sources within this state.\n\n(e) The income of nonresident or part-year resident individuals, trusts or estates which is derived from or related to sources both within and without this state shall be attributable to this state in the manner prescribed in the rules of the state tax commission.\n\n(4) In computing the Idaho taxable income of a part-year or nonresident individual, trust or estate, the standard deduction or itemized deductions, as defined in section 63-3022(j), Idaho Code, if applicable, and the exemptions, as defined in section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code or any allowance in lieu of such deduction, shall be allowed in the proportion that paragraph (a) of this subsection bears to paragraph (b) of this subsection:\n\n(a) The Idaho taxable income of the taxpayer modified as follows:\n\n(i) No allowance shall be made for either the standard deduction or itemized deductions;\n\n(ii) No deduction shall be made for personal exemptions or any allowance in lieu of such deduction.\n\n(b) The Idaho taxable income as would be calculated for a resident of Idaho modified as follows:\n\n(i) No allowance shall be made for either a standard deduction or itemized deductions;\n\n(ii) No deduction shall be made for personal exemptions or any allowance in lieu of such deduction;\n\n(iii) Compensation for active military service in the armed forces shall not be deducted;\n\n(iv) Income earned within the original exterior boundaries of any federally created Indian reservation by an enrolled Indian in a federally recognized Indian tribe on a federally recognized Indian reservation shall be added if not otherwise included.\n\n(5) An adjustment may be made to eliminate distortions in the amount of net income attributable to a taxpayer’s activities within the state of Idaho. Such deductions shall be limited to circumstances involving itemized deductions as referred to in subsection (4) of this section and which reflect:\n\n(a) A failure to reflect the net income or deduction after reimbursements have been received; or\n\n(b) A failure to reflect the net amount of mortgage interest income or expense from activities within Idaho.\n\n(6) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, deductions and adjustments allowed in computing the Idaho taxable income of nonresident and part-year resident individuals, trusts and estates shall be prescribed in the rules of the state tax commission. Such rules shall be based upon:\n\n(a) Whether or not the deduction or adjustment is related to the production of income reportable to Idaho;\n\n(b) Whether or not the deduction or adjustment is related to income received, expenses paid, or events of tax consequence which occurred during a portion of a taxable year that the taxpayer was domiciled in or residing in Idaho; or\n\n(c) Any other appropriate basis for making the adjustment. An \"appropriate basis\" is one which the state tax commission finds is needed to insure that the amount of Idaho taxable income is fairly and reasonably related to a taxpayer’s activities in this state.\n\n[63-3026A, added 1995, ch. 111, sec. 26, p. 364; am. 1996, ch. 40, sec. 3, p. 105; am. 1998, ch. 42, sec. 4, p. 180; am. 2000, ch. 38, sec. 5, p. 74; am. 2005, ch. 21, sec. 1, p. 57; am. 2005, ch. 405, sec. 1, p. 1380; am. 2007, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 21; am. 2010, ch. 108, sec. 1, p. 219; am. 2011, ch. 3, sec. 2, p. 6; am. 2013, ch. 83, sec. 1, p. 203.]",

If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.\n\n(7)(a) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state.\n\n(b) Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if:\n\n(i) The property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale; or\n\n(ii) The taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs.\n\n(c) Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in this state, unless such gains and losses constitute apportionable income as defined in this section.\n\n(8) Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in this state, unless such interest or dividends constitute apportionable income as defined in this section.\n\n(9)(a) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state:\n\n(i) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state; or\n\n(ii) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in this state.\n\n(b) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patent product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is located.\n\n(c) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is located.\n\n(10)(a) All apportionable income shall be apportioned to this state under subsection (11) of this section by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in Idaho during the tax period and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.\n\n(b) An electrical corporation as defined in section 61-119, Idaho Code, a telephone corporation as defined in section 62-603, Idaho Code, a communications company as defined in this section, or a taxpayer subject to a special industry regulation pursuant to subsection (18) of this section may elect to apportion all apportionable income of the taxpayer to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor and the denominator of which is three (3). Where a taxpayer makes an election to use a special industry regulation under this paragraph, if the property, payroll, or sales factors are defined in a special industry regulation pursuant to subsection (18) of this section, those definitions or terms will be controlling to the extent they are in conflict with the definitions provided in subsections (12) through (16) of this section.\n\n(11)(a) In the case of a corporation or group of corporations combined under subsection (22) of this section, Idaho taxable income or loss of the corporation or combined group shall be determined as follows:\n\n(i) From the income or loss of the corporation or combined group of corporations, subtract any nonapportionable income and subtract any nonapportionable loss included in the total; and\n\n(ii) Multiply the amounts determined under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by the Idaho apportionment percentage defined in subsection (10) of this section, taking into account, where applicable, the property, payroll, and sales of all corporations, wherever incorporated, that are included in the combined group. The resulting product shall be the amount of income or loss apportioned to Idaho.\n\n(b) To the amount determined as apportionable income or loss under paragraph (a)(ii) of this subsection, add nonapportionable income allocable entirely to Idaho under the provisions of this section or subtract nonapportionable loss allocable entirely to Idaho under this section. The resulting sum is the Idaho taxable income or loss of the corporation.\n\n(c) In the case of a corporation not subject to subsection (22) of this section, the income or loss referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this subsection shall be the taxable income of the corporation after making appropriate adjustments under the provisions of section 63-3022, Idaho Code.\n\n(12) Sales of tangible personal property, including gross receipts from leases and other uses of tangible personal property, are in this state if:\n\n(a) The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, within this state, regardless of the free on board (f.o.b.) point or other conditions of the sale; or\n\n(b) The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state; and\n\n(i) The purchaser is the United States government; or\n\n(ii) The taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.\n\n(13) Sales, other than sales of tangible property, are in this state if the taxpayer’s market for the sales is in this state. The taxpayer’s market for sales is in this state:\n\n(a) In the case of sale, rental, lease, or license of real property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;\n\n(b) In the case of rental, lease, or license of tangible personal property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;\n\n(c) In the case of a service, if and to the extent the service is delivered to a location in this state;\n\n(d) In the case of intangible property that is:\n\n(i) Rented, leased, or licensed, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, provided that intangible property utilized in marketing a good or service to a consumer is \"used in this state\" if that good or service is purchased by a consumer who is in this state; and\n\n(ii) Sold, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, provided that:\n\n1. A contract right, government license, or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area is \"used in this state\" if the geographic area includes all or part of this state; and\n\n2. Receipts from intangible property sales that are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible property shall be treated as receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing of such intangible property under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; and\n\n(e) In the case of sales of a broadcaster from advertising or licensing income that arises from the broadcast or other distribution of film programming by any means, if the commercial domicile of the broadcast customer, as defined in this section, is in this state. Other sales of a broadcaster shall be apportioned in a manner consistent with the rules that apply to such sales.\n\n(14) If the state or states of assignment under subsection (13) of this section cannot be determined, the state or states of assignment shall be reasonably approximated.\n\n(15) A communications company, as defined in this section, may elect to use this subsection for purposes of sourcing sales other than the sales of tangible personal property. If such an election is made, sales other than sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:\n\n(a) All the income-producing activity is performed in this state; or\n\n(b) The income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.\n\n(16) If a taxpayer makes the election in subsection (10)(b) of this section or is using an alternative method pursuant to subsection (17) of this section that requires the use of a property or payroll factor, the property and payroll factor definitions in this subsection apply.\n\n(a) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.\n\n(b) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.\n\n(c) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period, but the state tax commission may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer’s property.\n\n(d) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.\n\n(e) Compensation is paid in this state if:\n\n(i) The individual’s service is performed entirely within the state; or\n\n(ii) The individual’s service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual’s service within the state; or\n\n(iii) Some of the service is performed in the state and:\n\n1. The base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state; or\n\n2. The base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual’s residence is in this state.\n\n(17) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the state tax commission may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:\n\n(a) Separate accounting;\n\n(b) The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;\n\n(c) The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in this state; or\n\n(d) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.\n\n(18) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of business activity in Idaho of taxpayers engaged in a particular industry or in a particular transaction or activity, the state tax commission may, in addition to the authority in subsection (17) of this section, establish appropriate rules for determining alternative allocation and apportionment methods for such taxpayers. A rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be applied uniformly, except that, with respect to any taxpayer to whom such rule applies, the taxpayer may petition for, or the state tax commission may require, adjustment pursuant to subsection (17) of this section.\n\n(19)(a) The party petitioning for, or the state tax commission requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation or apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (17) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n(i) That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in Idaho; and\n\n(ii) That the alternative to such provision is reasonable.\n\n(b) The same burden of proof shall apply, whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the state tax commission is requiring, the use of any reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income. However, if the state tax commission can show that in any two (2) of the prior five (5) years the taxpayer had used an allocation or apportionment method at variance with its allocation or apportionment method or methods used for such other tax years, then the state tax commission shall not bear the burden of proof in imposing a different method pursuant to subsection (17) of this section.\n\n(20) If the state tax commission requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the state tax commission cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section.\n\n(21) A taxpayer that has received written permission from the state tax commission to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the state tax commission reasonably relied.\n\n(22) For purposes of this section and sections 63-3027B through 63-3027E, Idaho Code, the income of two (2) or more corporations, wherever incorporated, the voting stock of which is more than fifty percent (50%) owned directly or indirectly by a common owner or owners, when necessary to accurately reflect income, shall be allocated or apportioned as if the group of corporations were a single corporation, in which event:\n\n(a) The Idaho taxable income of any corporation subject to taxation in this state shall be determined by use of a combined report that includes the income, determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection, of all corporations that are members of a unitary business, allocated and apportioned using apportionment factors for all corporations included in the combined report and methods set out in this section. The use of a combined report does not disregard the separate corporate identities of the members of the unitary group. Each corporation transacting business in this state is responsible for its apportioned share of the combined apportionable income plus its nonapportionable income or loss allocated to Idaho, minus its net operating loss carryover or carryback.\n\n(b) The income of a corporation to be included in a combined report shall be determined as follows:\n\n(i) For a corporation incorporated in the United States or included in a consolidated federal corporation income tax return, the income to be included in the combined report shall be the taxable income for the corporation after making appropriate adjustments under the provisions of section 63-3022, Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) For a corporation incorporated outside the United States but not included in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the income to be included in the combined report shall be the net income before income taxes of such corporation stated on the profit and loss statements of such corporation which are included within the consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for the group of related corporations of which the corporation is a member, which statement is prepared for filing with the United States securities and exchange commission. If the group of related companies is not required to file such profit and loss statement with the United States securities and exchange commission, the profit and loss statement prepared for reporting to shareholders and subject to review by an independent auditor may be used to obtain net income before income taxes. In the alternative, and subject to reasonable substantiation and consistent application by the group of related companies, adjustments may be made to the profit and loss statements of the corporation incorporated outside the United States, if necessary, to conform such statements to tax accounting standards as required by the Internal Revenue Code as if such corporation were incorporated in the United States and required to file a federal income tax return, subject to appropriate adjustments under the provisions of section 63-3022, Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) If the income computation for a group under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph results in a loss, such loss shall be taken into account in other years, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of section 63-3022, Idaho Code; and\n\n(iv) When one (1) or more corporations included in a combined report have excess inclusion income for a tax year that is taxable to those corporations pursuant to section 63-3011B, Idaho Code, the amount of such excess inclusion income shall be reported as the taxable income for those members of the combined group as provided by section 63-3011B, Idaho Code, and any net operating loss for that tax year or carried forward from an earlier tax year may be taken as deductions in other tax years, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of section 63-3022, Idaho Code. In computing the net operating loss that may be used in another tax year for that corporation or other member of the combined return group, the excess inclusion income recognized as taxable income shall be deducted from gross income, as provided by treasury regulation 1.860E-1(a)(1).\n\n(23) If compensation is paid in the form of a reasonable cash fee for the performance of management services directly for the United States government at the Idaho national laboratory or any successor organization, separate accounting for that part of the business activity without regard to other activity of the taxpayer in the state of Idaho or elsewhere shall be required; provided that only that portion of general expenses clearly identifiable with Idaho business operations of that activity shall be allowed as a deduction.\n\n(24) The state tax commission shall promulgate rules as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n[63-3027, added 1959, ch. 299, sec. 27, p. 613; am. 1961, ch. 328, sec. 10, p. 622; am. 1965, ch. 254, sec. 1, p. 639; am. 1969, ch. 319, sec. 9, p. 982; am. 1972, ch. 398, sec. 5, p. 1149; am. 1975, ch. 32, sec. 1, p. 52; am. 1979, ch. 250, sec. 1, p. 654; am. 1985, ch. 114, sec. 2, p. 233; am. 1993, ch. 284, sec. 3, p. 964; am. 1994, ch. 247, sec. 2, p. 782; am. 1994, ch. 301, sec. 1, p. 948; am. 1995, ch. 111, sec. 27, p. 366; am. 1998, ch. 42, sec. 5, p. 182; am. 2007, ch. 10, sec. 2, p. 10; am. 2014, ch. 74, sec. 2, p. 192; am. 2022, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 157.]",

(a) A qualified taxpayer, as defined in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section whose income is subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, may elect to determine its income derived from or attributable to sources within this state pursuant to a water’s-edge election in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, as modified by sections 63-3027B through 63-3027E, Idaho Code. A taxpayer who makes a water’s-edge election shall take into account the income and apportionment factors of all affiliated corporations in a unitary relationship with the taxpayer, other than corporations filing elections under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, and which either file a federal income tax return under the Internal Revenue Code or are included in a federal consolidated return.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) The phrase \"over fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock directly or indirectly owned or controlled\" shall be substituted for the phrase \"at least eighty percent (80%)\" each place it appears in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(2) Any combined return shall include only corporations the voting stock of which is more than fifty percent (50%) owned directly or indirectly by a common owner or owners.\n\n(3) A \"qualified taxpayer\" is a corporation which files, with the state income tax return on which the water’s-edge election is made, a consent to the reasonable production of documents within the taxing jurisdiction.

(1) At the election of the taxpayer, there shall be allowed, subject to the applicable limitations provided herein as a credit against the income tax imposed by chapter 30, title 63, Idaho Code, an amount equal to the sum of:\n\n(a) The tax credit carryovers; and\n\n(b) The tax credit for the taxable year.\n\n(2) The maximum allowable amount of the credit for the current taxable year shall be three percent (3%) of the amount of qualified investments made during the taxable year.\n\n(3) As used in this section, \"qualified investment\" means certain property that:\n\n(a)(i) Is eligible for the federal investment tax credit, as defined in sections 46(c) and 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to the limitations provided for certain regulated companies in section 46(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, and is not a motor vehicle under eight thousand (8,000) pounds gross weight; or\n\n(ii) Is qualified broadband equipment, as defined in section 63-3029I, Idaho Code;\n\n(b) Is acquired, constructed, reconstructed, erected or placed into service after December 31, 1981; and\n\n(c) Has a situs in Idaho, as determined pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.\n\n(4)(a) For qualified investments placed in service in 2003 and thereafter, a taxpayer, other than a person whose rate of charge or rate of return or both is regulated or limited according to federal or state law, may elect, in lieu of the credit provided by this section, a two (2) year exemption from all taxes on personal property on the qualified investment. The exemption from personal property tax shall apply to the year the election is filed as provided in this section and the immediately following year. The election provided by this paragraph is available only to a taxpayer whose Idaho taxable income, before application of net operating losses carried back or forward, in the second preceding taxable year in which the investment is placed in service is negative.\n\n(b) The election shall be made in the form prescribed by the state tax commission and shall include a specific description and location of all qualified investments placed into service and located in the jurisdiction of the assessing authority, a designation of the specific assets for which the exemption is claimed, and such other information as the state tax commission may require. The election must be made by including the election form with the listing of personal property required by section 63-302, Idaho Code, or, in the case of operating property assessed under chapter 4, title 63, Idaho Code, with the operator’s statement required by section 63-404, Idaho Code. Once made, the election is irrevocable. If no election is made, the election is not otherwise available. A copy of the election form must also be attached to the original income tax return due for the taxable year in which the claim was made.\n\n(c) The state tax commission and the various county assessors are authorized to exchange information as necessary to properly coordinate the exemption provided in this subsection. Information disclosed to county officials under this subsection may be used only to determine the validity or amount of a taxpayer’s entitlement to the exemption provided in this section and is not otherwise subject to public disclosure as provided in section 74-107, Idaho Code.\n\n(d) In the event that an investment in regard to which the election under this subsection was made is determined by the state tax commission:\n\n(i) To not be a qualified investment;\n\n(ii) To have ceased to qualify during the recapture period; or\n\n(iii) To be otherwise not qualified for the election;\n\nthe taxpayer shall be subject to recapture of the property tax benefit.\n\n(e) The benefit to be recaptured in paragraph (d) of this subsection shall be computed in the manner required in subsection (7) of this section, and such recapture amount shall be subject to assessment in the same manner as a deficiency in tax under this chapter. For purposes of calculating the recapture, the property tax benefit shall be:\n\n(i) In the case of locally assessed property located in a single county or nonapportioned centrally assessed property, the market value of exempted property times the average property tax levy for that county in the year or years for which the exemption was claimed; or\n\n(ii) In the case of other centrally assessed property and property located in more than one (1) county, the market value of exempted property times the average urban property tax levy of the state as determined by the state tax commission in each of the years for which the exemption was claimed.\n\n(f) In the event that a recapture of the exemption is required under this subsection, the person claiming the exemption shall report the event to the state tax commission in the manner the state tax commission may by rule require. The report shall be due no later than the due date of that person’s income tax return under this chapter for the taxable year in which the event occurs. The recapture amount is due and payable with the report. Any amount of recapture not paid is a deficiency within the meaning of section 63-3044, Idaho Code.\n\n(g) All moneys collected by the state tax commission pursuant to this subsection, which amounts are continuously appropriated for this purpose, shall be deposited with the state treasurer and placed in the state refund account, as provided by section 63-3067, Idaho Code, to be remitted to the county within which the property was located that was not a qualified investment or ceased to qualify during the recapture period. The county shall distribute this remittance to all appropriate taxing districts based on the proportion each appropriate taxing district’s levy is to the total of all the levies of the taxing districts for the tax code area where the property was located for each year the exemption was granted. If any taxing district is dissolved or disincorporated, the proportionate share of the remittance to be distributed to that taxing district shall be deposited in the county current expense fund.\n\n(h) For purposes of the limitation provided by section 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as property tax revenue by taxing districts.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the amount of the credit allowed shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the tax liability of the taxpayer. The tax liability of the taxpayer shall be the tax after deducting the credit allowed by section 63-3029, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) If the sum of credit carryovers from the credit allowed by subsection (2) of this section and the amount of credit for the taxable year from the credit allowed by subsection (2) of this section exceed the limitation imposed by subsection (5) of this section for the current taxable year, the excess attributable to the current taxable year’s credit shall be an investment credit carryover to the fourteen (14) succeeding taxable years as long as the qualified investment property for which the unused credit was granted otherwise remains a qualified investment as determined under subsection (3) of this section in each of the taxable years during the recapture period. In the case of a group of corporations filing a combined report under section 63-3027, Idaho Code, or sections 63-3027B through 63-3027E, Idaho Code, credit earned by one (1) member of the group but not used by that member may be used by another member of the group, subject to the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, instead of carried over. The entire amount of unused credit shall be carried forward to the earliest of the succeeding years, wherein the oldest available unused credit shall be used first. For a combined group of corporations, credit carried forward may be claimed by any member of the group, unless the member who earned the credit is no longer included in the combined group.\n\n(7) Any recapture of the credit allowed by subsection (2) of this section on property disposed of or ceasing to qualify, prior to the close of the recapture period, shall be determined according to the applicable recapture provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of a unitary group of corporations, the increase in tax due to the recapture of investment tax credit must be reported by the member of the group who earned the credit regardless of which member claimed the credit against tax.\n\n(8) For the purpose of determining whether property placed in service is a \"qualified investment\" as defined in subsection (3) of this section, the provisions of section 49 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded. \"Qualified investment\" shall not include any amount for which a deduction is allowed under section 168(k) or section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code in computing Idaho taxable income.\n\n(9) For purposes of this section, property has a situs in Idaho during a taxable year if it is used in Idaho at any time during the taxable year. Property not used in Idaho during a taxable year does not have a situs in Idaho in the taxable year during which the property is not used in Idaho or in any subsequent taxable year. The Idaho situs of property must be established by records maintained by the taxpayer that are created reasonably contemporaneously with the use of the property.\n\n(10) In the case of property used both in and outside Idaho, the taxpayer electing to claim the credit provided in this section must elect to compute the qualified investment in property with a situs in Idaho for all such investments first qualifying during that year in one (1), but only one (1), of the following ways:\n\n(a) The amount of each qualified investment in a specific asset shall be separately computed based on the percentage of the actual use of the property in Idaho by using a measure of the use, such as total miles or total machine hours, that most accurately reflects the beneficial use during the taxable year in which it is first acquired, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or placed into service; provided that the asset is placed in service more than ninety (90) days before the end of the taxable year. In the case of assets acquired, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or placed into service within ninety (90) days prior to the end of the taxable year in which the investment first qualifies, the measure of the use of that asset within Idaho for that year shall be based on the percentage of use in Idaho during the first ninety (90) days of use of the asset; or\n\n(b) The investment in qualified property used both inside and outside Idaho during the taxable year in which it is first acquired, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or placed into service shall be multiplied by the percent of the investment that would be included in the numerator of the Idaho property factor determined pursuant to section 63-3027, Idaho Code, for the same year; provided that the asset is placed in service more than ninety (90) days before the end of the taxable year. In the case of assets acquired, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or placed into service within ninety (90) days prior to the end of the taxable year in which the investment first qualifies, the investment in qualified property used both inside and outside Idaho shall be multiplied by the percent of the investment that would be included in the numerator of the Idaho property factor determined pursuant to section 63-3027, Idaho Code, during the first ninety (90) days of use of the asset.\n\n(11) References to sections 46, 48 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code mean those sections as they existed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 prior to November 5, 1990.\n\n[63-3029B, added 1982, ch. 48, sec. 1, p. 72; am. 1987, ch. 319, sec. 1, p. 671; am. 1992, ch. 153, sec. 1, p. 459; am. 1993, ch. 2, sec. 1, p. 4; am. 1994, ch. 247, sec. 6, p. 790; am. 1995, ch. 94, sec. 1, p. 270; am. 1996, ch. 40, sec. 4, p. 107; am. 2000, ch. 457, sec. 1, p. 1430; am. 2000, ch. 479, sec. 5, p. 1655; am. 2001, ch. 270, sec. 6, p. 984; am. 2001, ch. 386, sec. 5, p. 1353; am. 2003, ch. 345, sec. 1, p. 923; am. 2004, ch. 204, sec. 1, p. 621; am. 2005, ch. 23, sec. 1, p. 61; am. 2006, ch. 195, sec. 2, p. 600; am. 2008, ch. 319, sec. 3, p. 883; am. 2011, ch. 271, sec. 1, p. 738; am. 2012, ch. 40, sec. 1, p. 123; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 160, p. 504; am. 2023, ch. 33, sec. 1, p. 165.]",

The state tax commission shall approve advance payments only for eligible students whose parents’ modified adjusted gross income as indicated on their most recently filed tax return does not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the federal poverty level. Advance payments made under this subsection may be spent only on qualified expenses for which the parent may claim a credit under the provisions of this section. In order to enable parents whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the federal poverty level to pay for a student’s education, an advance payment that is expended on qualified expenses for an eligible student may be claimed for such expenditure in that year and a parental choice tax credit shall be allowed on a parent’s tax return for that year, subject to the remaining requirements of this chapter.\n\n(10) Parents claiming the Idaho parental choice tax credit shall:\n\n(a) Claim the credit for only qualified expenses incurred on behalf of an eligible student;\n\n(b) Not claim the credit for any semester in which a student was enrolled full-time or part-time in a public school, public charter school, public virtual charter school, public magnet school, or part-time public kindergarten.\n\n(c) Not claim the credit for any tuition or fees related to academic instruction provided by the parent to such parent’s eligible student;\n\n(d) Ensure no other parent claims a credit for an eligible student. In the event more than one (1) parent claims a credit under this section for the same eligible student in the same year, the provisions of section 63-3029L(2), Idaho Code, shall be used to determine which parent is entitled to receive the credit; and\n\n(e) Fill out and submit the satisfaction and engagement survey provided for in subsection (14) of this section. No parent shall be eligible to receive a credit under the provisions of this section in a subsequent year if such parent has not submitted such survey for the last year that such parent received the credit.\n\n(11) If the credit exceeds the tax imposed by this chapter, the excess credit amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer. The state tax commission shall design the tax return forms to account for advance payment of the credit when calculating the tax imposed by this chapter.\n\n(12) The total amount of tax credits authorized for all taxpayers under this section shall not exceed fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) each tax year. In the event the total amount of claims for tax credits allowed by this section exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), the credits shall be allowed in full to parents whose applications were properly and timely filed and who have priority status under subsection (6) of this section, followed by the remaining parents who filed complete applications on a first-come, first-served basis, until the annual maximum limit is reached. The state tax commission shall create and maintain a waiting list demonstrating who would be eligible on a first-come, first-served basis if the annual maximum limit for credits allowed under this section is increased.\n\n(13)(a) Beginning with the first regular session of the sixty-ninth Idaho legislature in 2027, the state tax commission shall provide an annual report to the governor, the senate local government and taxation committee, the house revenue and taxation committee, and the joint finance-appropriations committee that shall include:\n\n(i) The total amount of tax credits provided each year under this section;\n\n(ii) The number of parents who applied each year for the Idaho parental choice tax credit;\n\n(iii) The amount of the average tax credit allowed;\n\n(iv) The number of credits distributed to parents with an adjusted gross income below three hundred percent (300%) of the federal poverty level;\n\n(v) The number of parents who applied each year for the advance payment pursuant to subsection (9) of this section, the number of advance payments awarded, and the median amount of the advance payments awarded;\n\n(vi) The geographic area of parents applying for the credit;\n\n(vii) The number of eligible students on the waiting list for each year; and\n\n(viii) A list of the categories of qualified expenses for which recipients used the tax credit, which shall include the dollar amounts for each category listed in subsection (2)(f) of this section.\n\n(b) The report shall not include any personally identifying information of eligible students, their parents, or their households.\n\n(14) Beginning in 2026, and each year thereafter, the legislative services office shall deliver to each parent who has received a tax credit under the provisions of this section a parent satisfaction and engagement survey to evaluate the performance of the nonpublic school that the eligible student attended. The survey shall include but not be limited to the quality of school leadership, school safety, student engagement, quality of academic instruction, and quality of learning outcomes. The state tax commission shall provide the legislative services office with contact information to identify each parent receiving a credit and any other information required for the legislative services office to properly deliver the surveys required under this subsection, and shall deliver the surveys to the parents no later than January 15 each year. Each parent shall complete the survey and submit the completed survey to the legislative services office no later than March 15. Beginning in 2027, the legislative services office shall submit a report to the governor, the senate local government and taxation committee, the house revenue and taxation committee, and the joint finance-appropriations committee that shall include a summary of the survey results.\n\n(15) Any taxpayer receiving an advance payment or claiming a tax credit without submission of a timely and properly prescribed form shall be ineligible to receive such payment or claim such credit. The state tax commission shall deny or recapture credits claimed by a parent for expenditures not authorized by the provisions of this section. If a parent has received an advance payment for an eligible student in a previous year, the parent shall not claim the credit for qualified expenses incurred in a year that a student ceases to qualify as an eligible student, except for any portion of the credit that exceeds the amount of the advance payment received. If a student ceases to qualify as an eligible student and the parent has already received the credit for that year, an amount of the credit, not exceeding the amount of the advance payment received, shall be repaid to or recovered by the state tax commission and deposited into the general fund.\n\n(16) Parents who claim the credit on a tax return without receiving prior approval of an application may not receive a credit, and the state shall have no liability to such parent.\n\n(17) The state tax commission shall, in as close to real time as practicable, make available on its website the annual maximum limit, the cumulative amount of credits claimed in applications under this section, and the cumulative amount of advance payments issued under this section until the annual maximum limit is reached.\n\n(18) The state tax commission shall also keep records of the total applications for credits and total claim of credits that exceed the annual maximum limit.\n\n(19) The state tax commission shall ensure that parents of eligible students receive notice in the application that participation in the program is a parental placement under 20 U.S.C. 1412 of the federal individuals with disabilities education act, along with an explanation of the rights that parentally placed students possess under the federal individuals with disabilities education act, including eligibility for equitable services, and any applicable state laws and regulations.\n\n(20) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to permit any government agency to exercise control or supervision over any nonpublic school or to give the state authority to regulate the education of nonpublic school students. A nonpublic school that enrolls a student whose parent directs a refundable tax credit to the school pursuant to this section is not an agent of the state or federal government. A nonpublic school shall not be required to alter its creed, practices, admissions policy, or curriculum in order to accept students whose payment of tuition or fees stems from a refundable tax credit under this section.\n\n[63-3029N, added 2025, ch. 9, sec. 2, p. 29.]",

An employer meeting the withholding threshold requirements of this subsection, but only having one (1) pay period per month, may, upon request to and approval by the state tax commission, pay in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n\n(5) If a payment required pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) of this subsection is not made or is made delinquently or if made is not equal to the withholding required under this section, the state tax commission may treat the failure as a failure to file a return and may take administrative and judicial actions as authorized by this chapter in the case of a failure to file a return. Interest, at the rate provided by section 63-3045, Idaho Code, shall apply to any such underpayment.\n\n(6) Commencing in 2006, the state tax commission shall determine whether the threshold amounts established by paragraph (4) of this subsection must be adjusted to reflect fluctuations in the cost of living. The state tax commission shall base its determination on the cumulative effect of the annual cost-of-living percentage modifications determined by the United States secretary of health and human services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 415(i). When the cumulative percentage applied to the monthly threshold amount equals or exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), the commission shall promulgate a rule adjusting the monthly threshold amount by five thousand dollars ($5,000) and making the necessary proportional adjustment to the annual threshold amount. The rule shall be effective for the next succeeding calendar year and each year thereafter until again adjusted by the commission. The tax commission shall determine subsequent adjustments in the same manner, in each case using the year of the last adjustment as the base year.\n\n(b) (1) In addition to the payments required pursuant to subsection (a)(2) and (4) of this section, every employer shall file a return upon such form as shall be prescribed by the state tax commission, but not more frequently than annually, or as required pursuant to any agreement between the state tax commission and the department of labor under section 63-3035B, Idaho Code, unless a shorter filing period and due date is prescribed by the state tax commission. The return shall be due on the last day of the first month following the end of the period to which the return relates. The return shall:\n\n(i) Show, for the period to which it relates, the total amount of wages, salary, bonus or other emolument paid to his employees, the amount deducted therefrom in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount deducted therefrom in accordance with the provisions of this section, the amount of any previous payments made pursuant to this section, the amount of any deficiency due from the employer or refund payable by the state tax commission and such pertinent and necessary information as the state tax commission may require.\n\n(ii) Include a copy of the declaration of withholding provided to employees pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Every employer making a declaration of withholding as provided herein shall furnish to the employees annually, but not later than thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar year, a record of the amount of tax withheld from such employee on forms to be prescribed, prepared and furnished by the state tax commission.\n\n(3) Every employer who is required, under Internal Revenue Code section 6011, to file returns on magnetic media, machine readable form or electronic means, as defined in the Idaho uniform electronic transactions act, may be required by rules of the state tax commission to file corresponding state returns on similar magnetic media, machine readable form or electronic means. Such rules may provide a different due date for such returns, which shall be no later than the date employers are required to file such returns with the internal revenue service or the social security administration and shall provide a five (5) business day period for an employer to correct errors in the electronic file received by the due date.\n\n(c) All moneys deducted and withheld by every employer shall immediately upon such deduction be state money and every employer who deducts and retains any amount of money under the provisions of this chapter shall hold the same in trust for the state of Idaho and for the payment thereof to the state tax commission in the manner and at the times in this chapter provided. Any employer who does not possess real property situated within the state of Idaho, which, in the opinion of the state tax commission, is of sufficient value to cover his probable tax liability, may be required to post a surety bond in such sum as the state tax commission shall deem adequate to protect the state.\n\n(d) The provisions of this chapter relating to additions to tax in case of delinquency, and penalties, shall apply to employers subject to the provisions of this section and for these purposes any amount deducted, or required to be deducted and remitted to the state tax commission under this section, shall be considered to be the tax of the employer and with respect to such amount he shall be considered the taxpayer.\n\n(e) Amounts deducted from wages of an employee during any calendar year in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be considered to be in part payment of the tax imposed on such employee for his tax year, which begins within such calendar year, and the return made by the employer under this subsection shall be accepted by the state tax commission as evidence in favor of the employee of the amount so deducted from his wages. Where the total amount so deducted exceeds the amount of tax on the employee, based on his Idaho taxable income, or where his income is not taxable under this chapter, the state tax commission shall, after examining the annual return filed by the employee in accordance with this chapter, but not later than sixty (60) days after the filing of each return, refund the amount of the excess deducted.\n\n(f) This section shall in no way relieve any taxpayer from his obligation of filing a return at the time required under this chapter, and, should the amount withheld under the provisions of this section be insufficient to pay the total tax of such taxpayer, such unpaid tax shall be paid at the time prescribed by section 63-3034, Idaho Code.\n\n(g) An employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to not more than, but may claim fewer than, the number of withholding allowances to which he is entitled under the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax withholding purposes.\n\n(h) An employer shall use the allowance certificate filed by the employee with the employer under the withholding allowance provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in determining the amount of tax to be withheld from the employee’s wages or salary under this chapter. The state tax commission may redetermine the number of withholding allowances to which an employee is entitled under subsection (g) of this section, and the state tax commission may require such allowance certificate to be filed on a form prescribed by the commission in any circumstance where the commission finds that the allowance certificate filed for Internal Revenue Code purposes does not properly reflect the number of withholding allowances to which the employee is entitled under this chapter. In no event shall any employee give an allowance certificate which claims a higher number of withholding allowances than the number to which the employee is entitled by subsection (g) of this section.\n\n[63-3035, added 1959, ch. 299, sec. 35, p. 613; am. 1963, ch. 352, sec. 1, p. 1013; am. 1965, ch. 316, sec. 7, p. 880; am. 1967, ch. 294, sec. 6, p. 828; am. 1969, ch. 319, sec. 12, p. 982; am. 1971, ch. 38, sec. 1, p. 84; am. 1982, ch. 219, sec. 1, p. 594; am. 1983, ch. 4, sec. 13, p. 13; am. 1983, ch. 20, sec. 2, p. 58; am. 1986, ch. 132, sec. 1, p. 339; am. 1987, ch. 33, sec. 1, p. 55; am. 1989, ch. 180, sec. 1, p. 447; am. 1990, ch. 34, sec. 2, p. 49; am. 1993, ch. 5, sec. 1, p. 16; am. 1994, ch. 40, sec. 1, p. 66; am. 1995, ch. 83, sec. 4, p. 245; am. 1995, ch. 111, sec. 32, p. 375; am. 1998, ch. 230, sec. 2, p. 783; am. 1999, ch. 41, sec. 1, p. 80; am. 2001, ch. 56, sec. 1, p. 101; am. 2003, ch. 296, sec. 1, p. 802; am. 2004, ch. 103, sec. 1, p. 364; am. 2004, ch. 103, sec. 2, p. 366; am. 2006, ch. 195, sec. 3, p. 604; am. 2008, ch. 9, sec. 1, p. 10; am. 2013, ch. 9, sec. 1, p. 17; am. 2016, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 12; am. 2016, ch. 31, sec. 1, p. 74; am. 2019, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 12.]",

NOTICE OF REDETERMINATION OR DEFICIENCY — INTEREST.\n\n(1)(a) If, in the case of any taxpayer, the state tax commission determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this title, the state tax commission shall, immediately upon discovery thereof, send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by first class mail or by other commercial delivery service providing proof of delivery, whichever is the most cost-efficient. The notice shall be sent to the taxpayer’s last address known to the state tax commission. The notice of deficiency shall be accompanied by an explanation of the specific reason for the determination and an explanation of the taxpayer’s right to appeal. Within sixty-three (63) days after such notice is mailed, the taxpayer may, at his option, file a protest in writing with the state tax commission and obtain redetermination of the deficiency.\n\n(b) If the taxpayer files a protest with the state tax commission within the period set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and such protest does not comply with the rules of the state tax commission and is therefore inadequate to perfect the taxpayer’s right to a redetermination of the deficiency determination, then the state tax commission shall notify the taxpayer, in the same manner as set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, of such inadequacies, setting forth in said notice the corrective action to be taken by the taxpayer to perfect his protest. The taxpayer shall thereafter have twenty-eight (28) days from the date of said notice to perfect his protest.\n\n(c) No assessment of a deficiency in respect to the tax imposed by this chapter, and no distraint or proceedings in court for its collection, shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until all appeal rights relating to the deficiency have become final.\n\n(2)(a) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer has the right to an independent administrative redetermination of the originating division’s determination before the state tax commission, including a hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to discuss the deficiency determination and the taxpayer’s protest with a commissioner or duly authorized representative of the commission. The meeting shall be held informally and evidence shall be freely admitted regardless of the rules of evidence.\n\n(b) Tax commission staff assigned to the administrative redetermination may not engage in communications relating to the taxpayer’s protest with employees of the originating division without first providing the taxpayer the opportunity to participate, except for questions that involve ministerial, administrative or procedural matters that do not address the substance of the issues or positions taken in the case or as otherwise allowed under title 63, Idaho Code, and the rules promulgated thereunder. The state tax commission shall promulgate rules governing communications with the originating division to ensure an independent review process. The provisions of this subsection do not create a substantive right affecting the taxpayer’s tax liability or the state tax commission’s ability to determine, assess or collect that tax liability, including statutory interest and any penalties, if applicable.\n\n(3) Any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section may be conducted, in whole or in part, by telephone, television, or other electronic means if each participant in the hearing has an opportunity to participate in the entire proceeding while it is taking place.\n\n(4) A taxpayer has the right to be represented by, or be accompanied by, any person of his choice in any proceeding before the tax commission. If the taxpayer is not present at a proceeding, the representative of that taxpayer must be designated in writing by the taxpayer as shall be prescribed in administrative rules or in any manner acceptable to the tax commission.\n\n(5) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence or documentation during the redetermination process subject to the provisions of section 63-3045B(3)(a), Idaho Code.\n\n(6) If the taxpayer does not file a protest with the state tax commission within the time prescribed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the deficiency shall be assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and demand from the state tax commission.\n\n(7)(a) Interest shall apply to deficiencies in tax and refunds of tax. Interest shall not apply to any penalty or to unpaid accrued interest. Interest relating to deficiencies or refunds accruing after the original due date of the return, but not including extensions of the due date, shall be computed on the net of any underpayments and overpayments of a tax liability required to be shown as due on the same return. Interest on deficiencies shall not accrue for any period beginning on the date on which the state tax commission identifies a return for possible audit until the date of the issuance of a notice of deficiency determination. Nor shall interest on deficiencies accrue for any period between the issuance of a notice of deficiency determination that is subject to a perfected protest and the final determination of the deficiency by the state tax commission following the state tax commission’s disposition of the protest.\n\n(b) Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the deficiency, shall be due and payable upon notice and demand from the state tax commission and shall be collected as a part of the tax at the rate per annum determined under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax. In the event any of the deficiency is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss or a capital loss carryback, such reduction in deficiency shall not affect the computation of interest under this subsection for the period ending with the last day of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or capital loss arises.\n\n(c) The rate of interest accruing during any calendar year, or portion thereof, upon any deficiency, or payable upon an overpayment or refund, shall be two percent (2%) plus the rate determined under section 1274(d), Internal Revenue Code, by the secretary of the treasury of the United States as the midterm federal rate as it applies on September 15 of the immediately preceding calendar year rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n(8) When the time provisions contained in this section conflict with the provisions of section 63-4208, Idaho Code, relating to the assessment of taxes on illegal possession of controlled substances, the provisions of section 63-4208, Idaho Code, shall prevail.\n\n[63-3045, added 2012, ch. 6, sec. 1, p. 9; am. 2017, ch. 18, sec. 1, p. 30; am. 2017, ch. 19, sec. 1, p. 33; am. 2024, ch. 116, sec. 1, p. 499; am. 2025, ch. 302, sec. 4, p. 1284.]",

Such a notice of additional tax due shall not be considered a notice of a deficiency nor shall the taxpayer have any right of protest or appeal as in the case of a deficiency based on such notice, and the assessment and collection of the amount of tax erroneously omitted in the return is not prohibited by any provision of this chapter.\n\n(c) Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date of receipt of payment, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter.\n\n(d) For all other purposes of this chapter, a tax is deemed assessed when:\n\n(i) A taxpayer fails to file a protest with the state tax commission within the time prescribed in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, or an action in district court or the board of tax appeals within the time prescribed in subsection (a) of section 63-3049, Idaho Code; or\n\n(ii) Upon conclusion of any such proceeding for any amount upheld at that conclusion of such proceeding.\n\n(2) An assessment is not required before the tax commission may conduct audits and investigations or make inquiries of taxpayers or other persons relating to matters within the tax commission’s jurisdiction. The making of an assessment is not required before the tax commission may file a judicial action under section 63-3030A or 63-3064, Idaho Code, or actions for injunctive or declaratory relief.\n\n(3) When taxes and related interest have been assessed, the state tax commission shall create a record of assessment by recording the liability of the taxpayer along with an identification of the taxpayer, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable period, if applicable, and the amount of the assessment. The record of an assessment shall be kept and maintained in a record in the office of the state tax commission in accordance with rules prescribed by the state tax commission.

total amount of the deficiency (in addition to such deficiency) shall be so assessed, collected and paid.\n\n(c) (1) In the event the return required by this chapter is not filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the return, there may be collected a penalty of five percent (5%) of the tax due on such returns for each month elapsing after the due date (including extensions) of such returns until the return is filed.\n\n(2) In the event the return required by this chapter is filed but the tax shown thereon to be due is not paid, there may be collected a penalty of one-half percent (0.5%) of the tax due on such return for each month elapsing after the later of the due date of such return or the date the return was filed until the tax is paid.\n\n(d) (1) If there is a

authority for such treatment, or\n\n(ii) Any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item’s tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the

This subsection shall not apply if the return for which the request for prompt action relates has not been filed with the state tax commission.\n\n(f) When Idaho taxable income or tax credits for any taxable year have been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of limitation for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the final federal determination to the state tax commission by the taxpayer, three (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this subsection the term \"final federal determination\" shall mean the final resolution of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits which were adjusted in the final federal determination shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.\n\n(g) If an adjustment, which was made within the period of limitations as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating loss, or capital loss claimed in such other tax year may be made and a resulting notice of deficiency may be issued even though such notice of deficiency would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when an amended Idaho return is filed within the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be three (3) years from the date the amended return was filed.

However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, then only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended federal return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.\n\n(j) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a notice of deficiency, related to items on the return of any pass-through entity, as defined in this section, which other taxpayers are required by law to report, shall be issued to such other taxpayers within the later of three (3) years from the due date of the other taxpayers’ return, without regard to extensions, three (3) years from the date the other taxpayers’ returns were filed, or three (3) years from the date of filing of the pass-through entity’s return. If the pass-through entity files an amended return, notices of deficiency may be issued to the other taxpayers within three (3) years from the date the amended return for the pass-through entity was filed with the state tax commission. If the pass-through entity files an amended return with the internal revenue service, or the internal revenue service issues a final determination to the pass-through entity, then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers shall be reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax commission by the pass-through entity of the amended federal return or the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery to the state tax commission by the pass-through entity of the final federal determination, three (3) years from the due date of the pass-through entity’s return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the pass-through entity’s return was filed.\n\n(k) For purposes of this section, \"pass-through entity\" means a partnership, S corporation, trust, limited liability company or any other entity whose items of income, deductions, gains, losses and credits must be reported by other taxpayer(s). For further purposes of this section, the term \"other taxpayer\" shall include, by way of unlimiting example, such taxpayers as partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, joint venturers or investors.\n\n(l) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b), Idaho Code, the limitation under this section shall be the later of one (1) year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable under this section.\n\n(m) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the issuance of a notice of deficiency for the tax imposed in this chapter, both the state tax commission, its delegate or deputy, and the taxpayer may consent in writing to extend the period of time within which a notice of deficiency may be issued. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations in accordance with this subsection, the period of limitations for the other taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers reflecting the adjustments to the pass-through entity’s return.\n\n(n) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this section shall be suspended for the time period during which the state tax commission is prohibited from issuing a notice of deficiency, making the assessment, or from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court, and for thirty (30) days thereafter.\n\n(o) For the purposes of this section, \"return\" includes a notice of deficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was filed by the taxpayer.

(a) Subject to the provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (h) of this section, where there has been an overpayment of the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter, the amount of such overpayment shall be credited against any tax administered by the state tax commission which tax is then due from the taxpayer, and any balance of such excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\n(b) Except in regard to amounts withheld as provided in section 63-3035, 63-3035A or 63-3036, Idaho Code, or amounts paid as estimated payments under section 63-3036A, Idaho Code, or amounts paid as backup withholding under section 63-3036B, Idaho Code, a claim for refund of tax, penalties, or interest paid shall be made within the later of three (3) years of the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the return was filed, and a claim for credit of tax, penalties, or interest paid shall be made within the later of ten (10) years of the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or ten (10) years from the date the return was filed. However, with regard to remittances received with an extension of time to file, or a tentative return, a claim for credit or refund of such remittances shall be made within three (3) years from the due date of the return without regard to extensions.\n\n(c) With regard to amounts withheld as provided in section 63-3035, 63-3035A or 63-3036, Idaho Code, or amounts paid as estimated payments under section 63-3036A, Idaho Code, or amounts paid as backup withholding under section 63-3036B, Idaho Code, a claim for refund shall be made within three (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, for the taxable year in respect to which the tax was withheld or paid, and a claim for credit shall be made within ten (10) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, for the taxable year with respect to which the tax was withheld or paid. However, with regard to an individual who is entitled to an extension of time as provided in section 7508 of the Internal Revenue Code, the three (3) year period provided in this subsection for claiming a credit or refund shall be extended by the number of days disregarded under section 7508 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when Idaho taxable income and/or tax credits for any taxable year have been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of limitations for claiming a refund or credit of tax, penalties, or interest shall be reopened and shall not expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the final federal determination to the taxpayer by the internal revenue service, three (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"final federal determination\" shall mean the final resolution of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsections (b) and (h) of this section, only those specific items of income, deductions, gains, losses or credits which were adjusted in the final federal determination shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.\n\n(e) If a claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback incurred in a taxable year commencing in 2012 or earlier, or a capital loss carryback, in lieu of the period of limitations prescribed in subsection (b) of this section, the period shall be that period which ends with the expiration of the fifteenth day of the fortieth month following the end of the taxable year of the net operating loss or capital loss which results in such carryback. Claims for net operating losses carried back from taxable years commencing after 2012 shall be made pursuant to section 63-3022, Idaho Code.\n\n(f) If an adjustment, which was made within the period of limitations as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating loss, or capital loss, claimed in such other tax year may be made and a claim for credit or refund of tax, penalties or interest may be made even though such claim would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.\n\n(g) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b), Idaho Code, the limitations under this section shall be the later of one (1) year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable under this section.\n\n(h) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for credit or refund of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter, both the state tax commission or its delegate or deputy and the taxpayer may consent in writing to extend such period of time. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations in accordance with the provisions of this subsection the period of limitations for the other taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of claiming a credit or refund of tax, penalties or interest by the other taxpayers reflecting the pass-through entity adjustments.\n\n(i) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this section shall be suspended for the time period between the issuance by the state tax commission of a notice under either section 63-3045 or 63-3065, Idaho Code, and the final resolution of any proceeding resulting from the notice.\n\n(j) Appeal of a state tax commission decision denying in whole or in part a claim for credit or refund shall be made in accordance with and within the time limits prescribed in section 63-3049, Idaho Code.\n\n(k) For purposes of this section, \"return\" includes a notice of deficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was filed by the taxpayer. Such a return is deemed filed on the date the taxes determined by the state tax commission are assessed.\n\n[63-3072, added 1993, ch. 47, sec. 3, p. 122; am. 1996, ch. 44, sec. 2, p. 117; am. 2001, ch. 56, sec. 4, p. 105; am. 2002, ch. 35, sec. 12, p. 80; am. 2007, ch. 10, sec. 4, p. 16; am. 2011, ch. 45, sec. 2, p. 103; am. 2013, ch. 4, sec. 5, p. 11; am. 2013, ch. 112, sec. 2, p. 271; am. 2022, ch. 311, sec. 1, p. 1002.]",
