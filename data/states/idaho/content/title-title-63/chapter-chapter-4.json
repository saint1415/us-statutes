Notwithstanding the provisions of section 63-301A, Idaho Code, property apportioned based on physical location pursuant to this subsection shall be placed on the new construction roll.\n\n(4) If the value of property of any company assessable under this section is of such a nature that it cannot reasonably be apportioned on the basis of rail, wire, pipeline mileage, such as microwave and radio relay stations, the tax commission may adopt such other method or basis of apportionment to the county and taxing districts in which the property is situate as may be feasible and proper.\n\n63-405. ASSESSMENT OF OPERATING PROPERTY. [EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2026] (1) The state tax commission must assess taxable operating property at a meeting of the commission convening on the second Monday of August in each year and must complete the assessment of such property on the fourth Monday in August.\n\n(2) The state tax commission shall determine the system value and calculate the allocation and apportionment of the system value for taxable operating property and specifically determine:\n\n(a) The number of miles and the value per mile of each railroad in the state and for each taxing district in which such railroad may exist.\n\n(b) The number of miles and the value per mile of each telephone corporation in the state and for each taxing district in which such telephone corporation may exist.\n\n(c) The number of miles and the value per mile of each pipeline in the state and for each taxing district in which such pipeline may exist.\n\n(d) The number of miles and the value per mile of each water company under the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission in the state and for each taxing district in which such water company may exist.

The value per mile of railroad line shall be determined by apportionment of the total value of line within the state. The apportionment shall be based twenty percent (20%) on the ratio of line miles in the state to line miles in the county; forty percent (40%) on the ratio of net ton miles in the state to net ton miles in the county; and forty percent (40%) on the ratio of station revenues in the state to station revenues in the county. All operating property of railroads shall be apportioned to the counties as part of the railroad line in the county. The apportionment for taxing districts shall be the same as the apportionment among counties.\n\n(e) The system value of private railcar fleets entering or standing in Idaho in the year preceding the constituted lien as provided in section 63-411(3), Idaho Code.\n\n(f) The system value and calculate the allocation and apportionment of the system value for all other taxable operating property.\n\n(3) For rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies subject to taxation as provided in section 63-3502B(3) or (4), Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:\n\n(a) The state tax commission shall reapportion the kilowatt-hour and thermal energy tax revenue that would have accrued to the dissolving district or revenue allocation area or expiring voter approved bond. The reapportioned tax shall be distributed to each otherwise eligible taxing district and revenue allocation area in the county with boundaries that overlapped the dissolved district or revenue allocation area or expired voter approved bond. The proportionate share for each taxing district and revenue allocation area shall be determined by dividing the current distribution to that district and revenue allocation area by the total distribution to all districts and revenue allocation areas that overlap the dissolving district or revenue allocation area.\n\n(b) Such reapportionment shall be made in the year immediately following the year of the dissolution and the county auditor shall be notified of the changed proportions no later than the first Monday in March of that year.\n\n(c) The proportions used to determine the amount of kilowatt-hour tax and thermal energy tax to be billed to rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies and payable to each county pursuant to section 63-3503C(2), Idaho Code, shall not change.\n\n(4) At least once every five (5) years, the state tax commission shall examine and verify the investment of each rate-regulated electric utility company, rate-regulated affiliated gas company, and rate-regulated gas company in each county and shall submit a report to the legislature that details each county’s investment in relation to the total statewide investment.\n\n(5) If the value of property of any company assessable under this section is of such a nature that it cannot reasonably be apportioned on the basis of rail, wire, and pipeline mileage, such as microwave and radio relay stations, the tax commission may adopt such other method or basis of apportionment to the county and taxing districts in which the property is situate as may be feasible and proper.\n\n(6) Any departure from market value in an assessment of operating property made to ensure compliance with federal law or precedent shall be considered an exemption. The state tax commission shall identify such departures from market value in their appraisals and no application need be made by a taxpayer to receive such exemption.\n\n[63-405, added 1996, ch. 98, sec. 5, p. 338; am. 1997, ch. 117, sec. 17, p. 317; am. 1998, ch. 400, sec. 3, p. 1252; am. 2004, ch. 105, sec. 1, p. 379; am. 2006, ch. 302, sec. 3, p. 935; am. 2025, ch. 188, sec. 2, p. 874.]",

In the event no private railcar fleets are assessed for five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or more in the current year, then the average property tax rate shall be the average tax rate on all taxable property for the prior year.\n\n(b) Each property tax so charged and levied shall constitute a perpetual lien as of January 1 of the year of assessment on all the operating property of the private railcar fleet within this state and shall be payable in the same manner and at the same due dates provided by law in respect to property taxes on personal property payable in the several counties.\n\n(c) In collecting such property taxes, the state tax commission is hereby authorized to pursue any or all of the rights, remedies or processes provided by law for the collection of a delinquency on personal property.\n\n(d) All moneys collected by the state tax commission as provided under this subsection shall be paid forthwith to the state treasurer for transfer to the public school income fund.\n\n(6) Whenever any person is delinquent in the payment of any obligation imposed by law, the state tax commission may give notice of the amount of the delinquency by registered mail to any railroad company over whose line or lines in this state the cars of said person have been transported, or are being transported, and which said railroad company has in its possession or under its control any credits or other personal property belonging to that person, or owes any debts to the delinquent.\n\n(a) After receiving the notice the railroad company so notified shall neither transfer nor make other disposition of the credits, personal property, or debts until the state tax commission consents to a transfer or disposition, or until thirty (30) days elapse after receipt of the notice.\n\n(b) All railroad companies so notified shall advise the state tax commission within five (5) days after receipt of the notice of all such credits, personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by them.\n\n(7) Whenever any railroad company advises the state tax commission that it has within its possession or under its control any credits or personal property belonging to a person with a delinquency, or owes any debt to that person, and the amount thereof, the state tax commission may thereupon issue a warrant of distraint and have the same served upon any such railroad company. Service of said warrant upon an agent of such railroad company within this state shall constitute valid service. Any railroad company so served shall pay over to the state tax commission the sum of any credits belonging to that person, or any debts owing to that person, whenever such credits or debts are less than the delinquency, penalty and costs; or shall pay over to the state tax commission the amount of the delinquency, penalty and costs, whenever such credits or debts are greater, and shall deduct the sum so paid over from the credits or debts due that person.\n\n[63-411 added 1996, ch. 98, sec. 5, p. 341.]",
