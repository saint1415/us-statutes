To qualify for credit or direct payment, the person or organization at the point of delivery must also be the person or organization pumping water for irrigation purposes and not a distributor or redistributor of electrical power. To receive the benefit of the exemption under this section, each consumer who is not a customer of the deliverer of electrical power must file an application with the state tax commission on or before April 30 each year. The state tax commission shall prescribe by rule the form and information necessary for such application. The procedures described in this section shall be used in determining the benefit to which each consumer is entitled by virtue of this exemption.\n\n(2) The rate-regulated electric utility shall include in its statement filed pursuant to section 63-3503C, Idaho Code, a schedule showing the kilowatt-hours relied on by the utility to provide the exemption provided in this section and a certification that the credits or refunds related to the exemption have been paid or credited.
