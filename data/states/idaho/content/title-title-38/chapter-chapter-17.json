      "text": "38-1702. FINDINGS AND POLICY. (1) The legislature finds that the sustainable management of national forests in Idaho is vital to conserving the state’s natural resources and its economic and ecological potential for the benefit of all Idahoans.\n\n(2) The legislature finds that national forests in Idaho should be sustainably managed to maintain health, diversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, and vitality with the potential to fulfill relevant ecological, economic, and social functions.\n\n(3) The legislature finds that sustainable forest stewardship and management of Idaho’s national forests requires a balanced approach that ensures a stable timber supply, active restoration, healthy watersheds, fish and wildlife habitat, areas for natural processes, and allowances for multiple uses.\n\n(4) The legislature finds that:\n\n(a) There is overwhelming evidence that the management, protection, and conservation of watersheds in Idaho is critical to the well-being of the state;\n\n(b) The water supplies of some of the state’s most populous cities and surrounding areas originate in federally managed watersheds that are at risk for catastrophic wildfire, the severity of which could be reduced by proper management;\n\n(c) Wildfires can compromise water quality both during active burning and for months and years after the fire has been extinguished. Burned watersheds are prone to increased flooding and erosion, which can negatively affect water supply reservoirs, water quality, and drinking water treatment processes; and\n\n(d) A burned-out watershed also affects the timing of snow melt and stream flow, which detrimentally affects irrigation and fisheries.\n\n(5) The legislature finds that smoke generated from wildfires poses significant harm to human health, impairs recreational opportunities, and negatively affects local economies throughout Idaho.\n\n(6) The legislature finds that catastrophic wildfire burns hundreds of thousands of acres each year in Idaho, which negatively affects private property and the Idaho endowments, limiting the revenue-generating capacity of the land.\n\n(7) The legislature declares that it is the policy of the state to promote the sustainable use of all national forests within the state through sound management and collaboration with local, state, and federal entities, including good neighbor authority, as provided in 16 U.S.C. 2113a.\n\n[38-1702, added 2024, ch. 243, sec. 1, p. 863.]",
