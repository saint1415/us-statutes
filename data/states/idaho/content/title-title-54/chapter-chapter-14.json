Each day an individual violates any of the provisions of this chapter or rules and standards of conduct and practice as may be adopted by the board shall constitute a separate offense.\n\n(3) Proceedings.\n\n(a) The executive director shall conduct such investigations and initiate such proceedings as necessary to ensure compliance with this section. The board may accept the voluntary surrender of a license from any nurse under investigation and accordingly enter an order revoking or suspending such license and/or imposing such conditions, limitations, or restrictions on the practice of any such nurse as may be appropriate in the discretion of the board. Otherwise, every person subject to disciplinary proceedings shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice. All proceedings hereunder shall be in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Hearings shall be conducted by the board or by persons appointed by the board to conduct hearings and receive evidence. The board and any person duly appointed by the board to conduct hearings shall have all powers as are necessary and incident to the orderly and effective receipt of evidence including, but not limited to, the power to administer oaths and to compel by subpoena attendance of witnesses and production of books, records and things at the hearing or at a deposition taken by a party in accordance with the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Any party shall be entitled to the use of subpoena upon application therefor.\n\n(c) In the event any person fails to comply with a subpoena personally served upon him or refuses to testify to any matter regarding which he may be lawfully interrogated, the board shall petition the district court in the county where such failure or refusal occurred, or where such person resides, to enforce such subpoena or compel such testimony. Proceedings before the district court shall be for contempt in the same nature as contempt of court for failure or refusal to comply with an order of the court, and the court shall have the same powers to secure compliance with subpoena and testimony or to impose penalties as in contempt of court proceedings.\n\n(d) The assessment of costs and attorney’s fees incurred in the investigation and prosecution or defense of an administrative proceeding against a licensee under this chapter shall be governed by the provisions of section 12-117(5), Idaho Code.\n\n(4) Probation/subsequent review. Any order of the board entered under this section may be withheld or suspended for a probationary period to be fixed by the board upon such terms and conditions as may be appropriate in order to regulate, monitor and/or supervise the practice of nursing by the licensee subject to such order for the prescribed probationary period. Any order of the board entered under this section may be withdrawn, reversed, modified or amended upon a showing by the person subject to the order that the grounds for discipline no longer exist or that he is rehabilitated, qualified and competent to practice nursing and that he is not likely to violate this chapter or rules adopted hereunder in the future.\n\n(5) Reporting investigative information.\n\n(a) Nothing in section 74-106(8) and (9), Idaho Code, shall be construed as limiting the authority of the board to report current significant investigative information to the coordinated licensure information system for transmission to states that are parties to any multistate agreements or compacts regarding nurse licensure.\n\n(b) The executive director of the board may, in the administration of this chapter, share information and otherwise cooperate with government regulatory and law enforcement agencies.\n\n[(54-1413) 54-1412, added 1977, ch. 132, sec. 2, p. 285; am. 1984, ch. 57, sec. 5, p. 104; am. and redesig. 1998, ch. 118, sec. 10, p. 443; am. 2001, ch. 76, sec. 2, p. 185; am. 2002, ch. 80, sec. 7, p. 181; am. 2008, ch. 67, sec. 2, p. 173; am. 2013, ch. 208, sec. 1, p. 496; am. 2014, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 377; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 138, p. 484; am. 2018, ch. 225, sec. 2, p. 514; am. 2018, ch. 348, sec. 5, p. 801; am. 2020, ch. 175, sec. 20, p. 522; am. 2021, ch. 34, sec. 1, p. 76.]",

The terms and conditions of the nurse licensure compact are hereby enacted in substantially the following form:\n\nNURSE LICENSURE COMPACT\n\nFINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE\n\na. The party states find that:\n\n1. The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;\n\n2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;\n\n3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation’s health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;\n\n4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;\n\n5. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and\n\n6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.\n\nb. The general purposes of this compact are to:\n\n1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety;\n\n2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;\n\n3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse actions;\n\n4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;\n\n5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;\n\n6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and\n\n7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.\n\nARTICLE IIDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\na. \"Adverse action\" means any administrative, civil, equitable or criminal action permitted by a state’s laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a nurse, including actions against an individual’s license or multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, limitation on the licensee’s practice, or any other encumbrance on licensure affecting a nurse’s authorization to practice, including issuance of a cease and desist action.\n\nb. \"Alternative program\" means a nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by a licensing board.\n\nc. \"Coordinated licensure information system\" means an integrated process for collecting, storing and sharing information on nurse licensure and enforcement activities related to nurse licensure laws that is administered by a nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by licensing boards.\n\nd. \"Current significant investigative information\" means:\n\n1. Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or\n\n2. Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.\n\ne. \"Encumbrance\" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.\n\nf. \"Home state\" means the party state which is the nurse’s primary state of residence.\n\ng. \"Licensing board\" means a party state’s regulatory body responsible for issuing nurse licenses.\n\nh. \"Multistate license\" means a license to practice as a registered or a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN) issued by a home state licensing board that authorizes the licensed nurse to practice in all party states under a multistate licensure privilege.\n\ni. \"Multistate licensure privilege\" means a legal authorization associated with a multistate license permitting the practice of nursing as either a registered nurse (RN) or LPN/VN in a remote state.\n\nj. \"Nurse\" means RN or LPN/VN, as those terms are defined by each party state’s practice laws.\n\nk. \"Party state\" means any state that has adopted this compact.\n\nl. \"Remote state\" means a party state, other than the home state.\n\nm. \"Single-state license\" means a nurse license issued by a party state that authorizes practice only within the issuing state and does not include a multistate licensure privilege to practice in any other party state.\n\nn. \"State\" means a state, territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\no. \"State practice laws\" means a party state’s laws, rules and regulations that govern the practice of nursing, define the scope of nursing practice, and create the methods and grounds for imposing discipline. \"State practice laws\" do not include requirements necessary to obtain and retain a license, except for qualifications or requirements of the home state.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION\n\na. A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.\n\nb. A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant’s criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state’s criminal records.\n\nc. Each party state shall require the following for an applicant to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state:\n\n1. Meets the home state’s qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as all other applicable state laws;\n\n2. (i) Has graduated or is eligible to graduate from a licensing board-approved RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program; or\n\n(ii) Has graduated from a foreign RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program that (a) has been approved by the authorized accrediting body in the applicable country and (b) has been verified by an independent credentials review agency to be comparable to a licensing board-approved prelicensure education program;\n\n3. Has, if a graduate of a foreign prelicensure education program not taught in English or if English is not the individual’s native language, successfully passed an English proficiency examination that includes the components of reading, speaking, writing and listening;\n\n4. Has successfully passed an NCLEX-RN® or NCLEX-PN® examination or recognized predecessor, as applicable;\n\n5. Is eligible for or holds an active, unencumbered license;\n\n6. Has submitted, in connection with an application for initial licensure or licensure by endorsement, fingerprints or other biometric data for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state’s criminal records;\n\n7. Has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a felony offense under applicable state or federal criminal law;\n\n8. Has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a misdemeanor offense related to the practice of nursing as determined on a case-by-case basis;\n\n9. Is not currently enrolled in an alternative program;\n\n10. Is subject to self-disclosure requirements regarding current participation in an alternative program; and\n\n11. Has a valid United States social security number.\n\nd. All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse’s multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that affects a nurse’s authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.\n\ne. A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.\n\nf. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state’s single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.\n\ng. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse’s then-current home state, provided that:\n\n1. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this compact’s effective date, must meet all applicable article III.c. requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new home state.\n\n2. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in article III.c. due to a disqualifying event occurring after this compact’s effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse’s multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the interstate commission of nurse licensure compact administrators (\"commission\").\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE\n\na. Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.\n\nb. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one (1) party state at a time.\n\nc. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two (2) party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission.\n\n1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.\n\n2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.\n\nd. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.\n\nADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS\n\na. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:\n\n1. Take adverse action against a nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.\n\ni. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse’s license issued by the home state.\n\nii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.\n\n2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse’s authority to practice within that party state.\n\n3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.\n\n4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.\n\n5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions.\n\n6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.\n\n7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.\n\nb. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse’s multistate license, the nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse’s multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse’s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.\n\nc. Nothing in this compact shall override a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse’s participation in an alternative program.\n\nCOORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION\n\na. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.\n\nb. The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this compact.\n\nc. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.\n\nd. Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.\n\ne. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.\n\nf. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.\n\ng. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.\n\nh. The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:\n\n1. Identifying information;\n\n2. Licensure data;\n\n3. Information related to alternative program participation; and\n\n4. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.\n\ni. The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION OF NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT ADMINISTRATORS\n\na. The party states hereby create and establish a joint public entity known as the interstate commission of nurse licensure compact administrators.\n\n1. The commission is an instrumentality of the party states.\n\n2. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n3. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nb. Membership, voting and meetings.\n\n1. Each party state shall have and be limited to one (1) administrator.

Disclosure of information related to any reports prepared by or on behalf of the commission for the purpose of investigation of compliance with this compact; or\n\nx. Matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal or state statute.\n\n6. If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed pursuant to this provision, the commission’s legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exempting provision. The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nc. The commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of this compact including, but not limited to:\n\n1.

The commission shall defend any administrator, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from that person’s intentional, willful or wanton misconduct.\n\n3. The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any administrator, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional, willful or wanton misconduct of that person.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\na. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and shall have the same force and effect as provisions of this compact.\n\nb. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.\n\nc.

On the website of the commission; and\n\n2. On the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.\n\nd. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n\n1. The proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n2. The text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n3. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n\n4.

The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.\n\ng. The commission shall publish the place, time and date of the scheduled public hearing.\n\n1. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nh. If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.\n\ni. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nj. The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\nk. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;\n\n2. Prevent a loss of commission or party state funds; or\n\n3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.\n\nl.

A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\nOVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT\n\na. Oversight.\n\n1. Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact’s purposes and intent.\n\n2. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the commission and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules.\n\nb. Default, technical assistance and termination.\n\n1. If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\ni. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\nii. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state’s membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state’s licensing board and each of the party states.\n\n4. A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\nc. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states.\n\n2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.\n\n3. In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:\n\ni. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.\n\nii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.\n\nd. Enforcement.\n\n1. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND AMENDMENT\n\na. This compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative enactment of this compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states or December 31, 2018. All party states to this compact, that also were parties to the prior nurse licensure compact, superseded by this compact, (\"prior compact\"), shall be deemed to have withdrawn from said prior compact within six (6) months after the effective date of this compact.\n\nb. Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the prior compact until such party state has withdrawn from the prior compact.\n\nc. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\nd. A party state’s withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state’s licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.\n\ne. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.\n\nf. This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.\n\ng. Representatives of nonparty states to this compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n[54-1418, added 2001, ch. 76, sec. 3, p. 187; repeal and new section added 2016, ch. 56, secs. 1 and 2, p. 165.]",

[EFFECTIVE DATE — SEE ARTICLE X OF COMPACT] The terms and conditions of the advanced practice registered nurse compact are hereby enacted in substantially the following form:\n\nADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE COMPACT\n\nFINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE\n\na. The party states find that:\n\n1. The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) licensure requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;\n\n2. Violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;\n\n3. The expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation’s health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;\n\n4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;\n\n5. The current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both APRNs and states; and\n\n6. Uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.\n\nb. The general purposes of this compact are to:\n\n1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety;\n\n2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform licensure requirements;\n\n3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;\n\n4. Promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction;\n\n5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;\n\n6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN licenses; and\n\n7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who meet uniform licensure requirements.\n\nARTICLE IIDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\na. \"Advanced practice registered nurse\" or \"APRN\" means a registered nurse who has gained additional specialized knowledge, skills and experience through a program of study recognized or defined by the interstate commission of APRN compact administrators (\"commission\") and who is licensed to perform advanced nursing practice.

Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the APRN to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or\n\n2. Investigative information that indicates that the APRN represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the APRN has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.\n\nh. \"Encumbrance\" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.\n\ni. \"Home state\" means the party state that is the APRN’s primary state of residence.\n\nj. \"Licensing board\" means a party state’s regulatory body responsible for regulating the practice of advanced practice registered nursing.\n\nk. \"Multistate license\" means an APRN license to practice as an APRN issued by a home state licensing board that authorizes the APRN to practice as an APRN in all party states under a multistate licensure privilege in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.\n\nl. \"Multistate licensure privilege\" means a legal authorization associated with an APRN multistate license that permits an APRN to practice as an APRN in a remote state in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.\n\nm. \"Noncontrolled prescription drug\" means a device or drug that is not a controlled substance and is prohibited under state or federal law from being dispensed without a prescription. The term includes a device or drug that bears or is required to bear the legend \"caution: federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription\" or \"prescription only\" or other legend that complies with federal law.\n\nn. \"Party state\" means any state that has adopted this compact.\n\no. \"Population focus\" means a specific patient population that is congruent with the APRN educational program, certification and commission rules.\n\np. \"Prescriptive authority\" means the legal authority to prescribe medications and devices as defined by party state laws.\n\nq. \"Remote state\" means a party state that is not the home state.\n\nr. \"Single-state license\" means an APRN license issued by a party state that authorizes practice only within the issuing state and does not include a multistate licensure privilege to practice in any other party state.\n\ns. \"State\" means a state, territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\nt. \"State practice laws\" means a party state’s laws, rules and regulations that govern APRN practice, define the scope of advanced nursing practice, including prescriptive authority, and create the methods and grounds for imposing discipline. State practice laws do not include the requirements necessary to obtain and retain an APRN license, except for qualifications or requirements of the home state.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION\n\na. A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial APRN licensure or APRN licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by APRN applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant’s criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state’s criminal records.\n\nb. By rule, the commission shall adopt the APRN uniform licensure requirements (\"ULRs\"). The ULRs shall provide the minimum requirements for APRN multistate licensure in party states, provided that the commission may adopt rules whereby an APRN, with an unencumbered license on the effective date of this compact, may obtain, by endorsement or otherwise, and retain a multistate license in a party state.\n\nc. In order to obtain or retain a multistate license, an APRN must meet, in addition to the ULRs, the home state’s qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as all other applicable home state laws.\n\nd. By rule, the commission shall identify the approved APRN roles and population foci for licensure as an APRN. An APRN issued a multistate license shall be licensed in an approved APRN role and at least one (1) approved population focus.\n\ne. An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the APRN to practice as an APRN in each party state, under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state. If an applicant does not qualify for a multistate license, a single-state license may be issued by a home state.\n\nf. Issuance of an APRN multistate license shall include prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs unless the APRN was licensed by the home state prior to the home state’s adoption of this compact and has not previously held prescriptive authority.\n\n1. An APRN granted prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs in the home state may exercise prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs in any remote state while exercising a multistate licensure privilege under an APRN multistate license; the APRN shall not be required to meet any additional eligibility requirements imposed by the remote state in exercising prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs.\n\n2. Prescriptive authority in the home state for an APRN who was not granted prescriptive authority at the time of initial licensure by the home state, prior to the adoption of this compact, shall be determined under home state law.\n\n3. Prescriptive authority eligibility for an APRN holding a single-state license shall be determined under the law of the licensing state.\n\ng. For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the APRN shall satisfy all requirements imposed by such state in granting and/or renewing such authority.\n\nh. An APRN issued a multistate license is authorized to assume responsibility and accountability for patient care independent of a supervisory or collaborative relationship with a physician. This authority may be exercised in the home state and in any remote state in which the APRN exercises a multistate licensure privilege. For an APRN issued a single-state license in a party state, the requirement for a supervisory or collaborative relationship with a physician shall be determined under applicable party state law.\n\ni. All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with state due process laws, to take adverse action against an APRN’s multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that affects an APRN’s authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.\n\nj. An APRN practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. APRN practice is not limited to patient care but shall include all advanced nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.\n\nk. This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as an APRN in that state.\n\nl. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state’s single-state APRN license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an APRN in any other party state.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR APRN LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE\n\na. Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license or an advanced practice registered nurse license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.\n\nb. An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home state, in only one (1) party state at a time.\n\nc. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two (2) party states, the APRN must apply for APRN licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state shall be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.\n\n1. The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.\n\n2. A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.\n\nd. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the APRN multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.\n\nADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS\n\na. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:\n\n1. Take adverse action against an APRN’s multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.\n\ni. Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action against an APRN’s license issued by the home state.\n\nii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.\n\n2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an APRN’s authority to practice within that party state.\n\n3. Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.\n\n4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses and/or evidence are located.\n\n5. Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions.\n\n6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that APRN.\n\n7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.\n\nb. If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN’s multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the APRN’s multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN’s multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN’s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.\n\nc. Nothing in this compact shall override a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration of the APRN’s participation in an alternative program.\n\nCOORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION\n\na. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of APRN licensure and enforcement efforts.\n\nb. The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this compact.\n\nc. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials) and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic and/or confidential under state law.\n\nd. Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.\n\ne. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.\n\nf. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.\n\ng. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing the information shall be removed from the coordinated licensure information system.\n\nh. The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:\n\n1. Identifying information;\n\n2. Licensure data;\n\n3. Information related to alternative program participation information; and\n\n4. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.\n\ni. The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION OF APRN COMPACT ADMINISTRATORS\n\na. The party states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the interstate commission of APRN compact administrators.\n\n1. The commission is an instrumentality of the party states.\n\n2. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n3. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nb. Membership, voting and meetings.\n\n1. Each party state shall have and be limited to one (1) administrator. The head of the state licensing board or designee shall be the administrator of this compact for each party state. Any administrator may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which the administrator is appointed. Any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be filled in accordance with the laws of the party state in which the vacancy exists.\n\n2. Each administrator shall be entitled to one (1) vote with regard to the promulgation of rules and creation of bylaws and shall otherwise have an opportunity to participate in the business and affairs of the commission.

Disclosure of information related to any reports prepared by or on behalf of the commission for the purpose of investigation of compliance with this compact; or\n\nx. Matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal or state statute.\n\n6. If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed pursuant to this provision, the commission’s legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exempting provision. The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nc. The commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of this compact including, but not limited to:\n\n1. Establishing the fiscal year of the commission;\n\n2. Providing reasonable standards and procedures:\n\ni. For the establishment and meetings of other committees; and\n\nii.

The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and shall have the same force and effect as provisions of this compact.\n\nb. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.\n\nc. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:\n\n1. On the website of the commission; and\n\n2. On the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.\n\nd. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n\n1. The proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n2. The text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n3. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n\n4. The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.\n\ne. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.\n\nf. The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.\n\ng. The commission shall publish the place, time and date of the scheduled public hearing.\n\n1. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nh. If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.\n\ni. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nj. The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\nk. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.

The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\nOVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT\n\na. Oversight.\n\n1. Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact’s purposes and intent.\n\n2. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the commission and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules.\n\nb. Default, technical assistance and termination.\n\n1. If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\ni. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\nii. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state’s membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state’s licensing board, the defaulting state’s licensing board, and each of the party states.\n\n4. A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\nc. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states.\n\n2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.\n\n3. In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:\n\ni. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.\n\nii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.\n\nd. Enforcement.\n\n1. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND AMENDMENT\n\na. This compact shall come into limited effect at such time as this compact has been enacted into law in ten (10) party states for the sole purpose of establishing and convening the commission to adopt rules relating to its operation and the APRN ULRs.\n\nb. On the date of the commission’s adoption of the APRN ULRs, all remaining provisions of this compact and rules adopted by the commission shall come into full force and effect in all party states.\n\nc. Any state that joins this compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of the APRN uniform licensure requirements shall be subject to all rules that have been previously adopted by the commission.\n\nd. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\ne. A party state’s withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state’s licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.\n\nf. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any APRN licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.\n\ng. This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any party state until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.\n\nh. Representatives of nonparty states to this compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n[54-1419, added 2016, ch. 55, sec. 1, p. 152.]",
