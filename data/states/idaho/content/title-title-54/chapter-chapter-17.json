The certificate shall contain the product name, lot number, expiration date, and assay;\n\n(c) Use equipment and utensils of suitable design and composition and that are cleaned, sanitized, or sterilized as appropriate prior to use; and\n\n(d) Remove unknown or questionable products from stock and isolate such products for return, reclamation, or destruction.\n\n(4) Compounding any drug products for human use that the FDA has identified as presenting demonstrable difficulties in compounding or has withdrawn or removed from the market is prohibited.\n\n(5) A drug product that is commercially available may only be compounded if not compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts or if the commercial product is not reasonably available in the market in time to meet a patient’s needs.\n\n(6) Limited quantities of a drug may be compounded or sterile prepackaged prior to receiving a valid prescription drug order based on a history of receiving valid prescription drug orders for the compounded or sterile prepackaged product.\n\n(7) Policies and procedures for the compounding or sterile prepackaging of drug products shall ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product.

      "text": "54-1767. HAZARDOUS DRUG PREPARATION. This section shall apply to all persons engaged in the practice of compounding or sterile prepackaging with hazardous drugs. Such persons shall:\n\n(1) Ensure the storage and compounding areas have sufficient general exhaust ventilation to dilute and remove airborne contaminants;\n\n(2) Utilize a ventilated cabinet designed to reduce worker exposures while preparing hazardous drugs. Sterile hazardous drugs shall be prepared in a dedicated class II biological safety cabinet or a barrier isolator of appropriate design to meet the personnel exposure limits described in product material safety data sheets. When asepsis is not required, a class I biological safety cabinet, powder containment hood or an isolator intended for containment applications may be sufficient. A ventilated cabinet that re-circulates air inside the cabinet or exhausts air back into the room environment is prohibited unless:\n\n(a) The hazardous drugs in use will not volatilize while they are being handled; or\n\n(b) Written documentation from the manufacturer is provided attesting to the safety of such ventilation.\n\n(3) Clearly identify storage areas, compounding areas, containers, and prepared doses of hazardous drugs;\n\n(4) Label hazardous drugs with proper precautions, and dispense them in a manner to minimize risk of hazardous spills;\n\n(5) Provide and maintain appropriate personal protective equipment and supplies necessary for handling hazardous drugs, spills, and disposal;\n\n(6) Unpack, store, prepackage, and compound hazardous drugs separately from other inventory in a restricted area in a manner to prevent contamination and personnel exposure until hazardous drugs exist in their final unity-of-use packaging; and\n\n(7) Ensure that personnel working with hazardous drugs are trained in hygiene, garbing, receipt, storage, handling, transporting, compounding, spill control, clean up, disposal, dispensing, medical surveillance, and environmental quality and control.\n\n[54-1767, added 2025, ch. 93, sec. 45, p. 439.]",

[EFFECTIVE UNTIL JULY 1, 2026] (1) A pharmacist who dispenses a biological product according to board rule shall communicate to the prescriber the name and manufacturer of the drug within five (5) business days following the dispensing of the biological product. Communication shall occur via an entry in an interoperable electronic medical records system, an electronic prescribing technology, a pharmacy benefit management system or a pharmacy record that can be accessed electronically by the prescriber. Entry into an electronic records system as described in this subsection shall be considered notice to the prescriber. Otherwise, the pharmacist shall communicate the biological product dispensed to the prescriber using facsimile, telephone, electronic transmission or other prevailing means, provided that the communication shall not be required when:\n\n(a) There is no interchangeable biological product approved by the federal food and drug administration for the product prescribed;\n\n(b) A refill prescription is not changed from the product dispensed on the prior filling of the prescription; or\n\n(c) The pharmacist or the pharmacist’s designee has already communicated to the prescriber the specific product to be provided to the patient, including the name and manufacturer of the product, prior to dispensing; and that product is the product that is actually dispensed.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall delay the dispensing of a valid prescription for a biological product.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section:\n\n(a) \"Biological product\" shall have the same meaning as in 42 U.S.C. 262(i).\n\n(b) \"Interchangeable biological product\" means a biological product that the federal food and drug administration has licensed and determined meets the standards for interchangeability set forth in 42 U.S.C. 262(k)(4) or has been deemed therapeutically equivalent by the federal food and drug administration in the latest edition of or supplement to the publication \"Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.\"\n\n[54-1769, added 2016, ch. 197, sec. 1, p. 553.]",
