(1) The administrator shall issue licenses to such persons as have by examination shown themselves to be fit, competent and qualified to engage in the trade of residential electrician, journeyman electrician, limited electrical installer or master electrician as defined in section 54-1003A, Idaho Code, and to such persons, firms, partnerships, associations or corporations as have shown themselves to be fit, competent and qualified to engage in the business of electrical contracting or limited electrical contracting as defined in section 54-1003A, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) An apprentice electrician, as defined in section 54-1003A, Idaho Code, may take the journeyman’s examination if he has completed the required related instruction for electrical apprentices as approved by the Idaho state board for career technical education, completion of which shall be evidenced by a certificate from an approved provider, and has worked the number of hours as prescribed by the Idaho electrical board, provided that for all the time he is claiming to have worked as an apprentice electrician, the apprentice shall have been registered with the division of occupational and professional licenses as an apprentice. The electrical board may by rule fix the apprentice registration fee, in an amount not to exceed the costs of issuing apprentice registration certificates and enforcing the apprentice registration provisions of this chapter, and may also by rule establish requirements relative to the manner of registration renewal, verification of employment, the number of instructional hours completed, and the number of hours worked.\n\n(3) Any person who has worked as a licensed journeyman for a period of not less than four (4) years and who has worked the number of hours as prescribed by rule of the board as a licensed journeyman electrician shall be considered as qualified to apply for a master electrician’s license in this state. The Idaho electrical board, in establishing by rule the requirements for a master electrician’s license, shall also take into account the applicant’s performance as a journeyman electrician. When issuing a master electrician’s license to a person, the administrator shall also issue a journeyman electrician’s license to such person at no additional cost and without any additional requirements beyond those required to receive a master electrician’s license.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, any person who can demonstrate eight (8) years of work experience, defined as a minimum of sixteen thousand (16,000) hours, making electrical installations on the job, shall be considered as qualified to apply for a journeyman electrician’s license in this state.\n\n(5) A person qualifies for a residential electrician license if he passes the residential electrician examination approved by the board, has completed a two (2) year course of related instruction for residential electrical apprentices as approved by the Idaho electrical board and the Idaho state board for career technical education, and submits proof of four thousand (4,000) hours of electrical experience as an Idaho-registered apprentice or in accordance with the requirements of the jurisdiction where the applicant obtained such experience. Completion of an approved course as required pursuant to this subsection shall be evidenced by a certificate from an approved provider. An applicant for a journeyman electrician license may utilize the experience hours identified in this section toward the work experience requirement for a journeyman electrician license.\n\n(6) To the extent that other states that provide for the licensing of electricians require qualifications at least equal to those contained in this chapter, the administrator may enter reciprocal agreements with such other states to grant licenses to electricians licensed by such other states. The administrator, on the recommendation of the Idaho electrical board, may grant licenses to electricians licensed by such other states upon payment by the applicant of the required fee and upon furnishing proof to the board that the applicant has qualifications at least equal to those provided herein for applicants for written examinations. Applicants who qualify for a license under this subsection are not required to take a written examination.\n\n(7) A provisional journeyman electrician, as defined in section 54-1003A, Idaho Code, may take the residential electrician or journeyman electrician examination. Upon passing the examination, the administrator of the division of occupational and professional licenses shall issue the provisional journeyman electrician a residential or journeyman electrician’s license.\n\n[54-1007, added 1947, ch. 251, sec. 7, p. 681; am. 1961, ch. 311, sec. 10, p. 583; am. 1972, ch. 142, sec. 1, p. 309; am. 1974, ch. 39, sec. 84, p. 1023; am. 1986, ch. 296, sec. 5, p. 745; am. 1986, ch. 309, sec. 1, p. 760; am. 1996, ch. 421, sec. 45, p. 1433; am. 1999, ch. 99, sec. 5, p. 314; am. 1999, ch. 329, sec. 25, p. 864; am. 1999, ch. 367, sec. 6, p. 972; am. 2002, ch. 123, sec. 1, p. 347; am. 2003, ch. 135, sec. 1, p. 392; am. 2004, ch. 245, sec. 1, p. 711; am. 2009, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 364; am. 2011, ch. 16, sec. 1, p. 52; am. 2016, ch. 25, sec. 43, p. 59; am. 2018, ch. 209, sec. 7, p. 472; am. 2019, ch. 66, sec. 1, p. 157; am. 2019, ch. 292, sec. 6, p. 870; am. 2023, ch. 15, sec. 40, p. 97; am. 2023, ch. 244, sec. 9, p. 750; am. 2024, ch. 16, sec. 15, p. 150; am. 2025, ch. 77, sec. 1, p. 352.]",
