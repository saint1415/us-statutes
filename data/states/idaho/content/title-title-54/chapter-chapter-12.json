In the event an applicant obtains a doctorate degree without first obtaining a master’s degree, the board may, at its discretion, give credit, not in excess of two (2) years.\n\nIn considering the combined education and experience qualifications of applicants, the board shall consider engineering teaching, land surveying teaching, each year of satisfactory completion of undergraduate college education, advanced degrees in engineering and advanced degrees in land surveying in establishing the applicants’ minimum composite knowledge and skill.\n\nThe mere execution, as a contractor, of work designed by a professional engineer, or the supervision of the construction of such work as a foreman or superintendent, shall not be deemed to be the practice of engineering, but if such experience, in the opinion of the board, has involved responsible supervision of a character that will tend to expand the engineering knowledge and skill of the applicant, the board may in its discretion give such credit therefor as it may deem proper.\n\nAny person having the necessary qualifications prescribed in this chapter that otherwise entitle him for initial licensure or certification shall be eligible although he may not be practicing his profession at the time of making his application.\n\nThe board may postpone acting on an application for certification or licensure if disciplinary or criminal action related to the applicant’s practice has been taken or is pending in any other jurisdiction. The board may postpone the notification of examination results to applicants on any examination if there is any unresolved examination irregularity involving the applicant. The board may investigate and adjudicate the validity of examination irregularities and if the examination irregularities are substantiated, the board may invalidate the examination result of the applicant.\n\n[54-1212, added 1939, ch. 231, sec. 12, p. 516; am. 1957, ch. 234, sec. 7, p. 547; am. 1961, ch. 258, sec. 3, p. 422; am. 1978, ch. 170, sec. 8, p. 371; am. 1986, ch. 140, sec. 11, p. 375; am. 1990, ch. 192, sec. 3, p. 424; am. 1992, ch. 61, sec. 1, p. 192; am. 1996, ch. 357, sec. 9, p. 1185; am. 1997, ch. 189, sec. 1, p. 514; am. 2000, ch. 289, sec. 7, p. 995; am. 2002, ch. 125, sec. 1, p. 350; am. 2003, ch. 15, sec. 1, p. 43; am. 2003, ch. 15, sec. 2, p. 46; am. 2004, ch. 84, sec. 1, p. 313; am. 2004, ch. 84, sec. 2, p. 315; am. 2008, ch. 378, sec. 9, p. 1030; am. 2008, ch. 378, sec. 10, p. 1033; am. 2010, ch. 111, sec. 1, p. 223; am. 2012, ch. 24, sec. 1, p. 78; am. 2015, ch. 48, sec. 3, p. 103; am. 2018, ch. 67, sec. 1, p. 159.]",

In the case of a professional engineer, the license shall authorize the practice of \"professional engineering,\" and in the case of a professional land surveyor, the license shall authorize the practice of \"professional land surveying.\" Licenses shall show the full name of the licensee, shall give a license number, and shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary of the board under seal of the board.\n\n(2) The issuance of a license by the board shall be prima facie evidence that the person named therein is entitled to all the rights, privileges and responsibilities of a licensed professional engineer or of a licensed professional land surveyor, provided that said license has not expired or has not been retired, suspended, or revoked.\n\n(3) Except for engineering faculty holding a restricted license pursuant to section 54-1214(5), Idaho Code, each licensee hereunder shall, upon licensure, obtain a seal, the use and design of which are described in this section. It shall be unlawful for any person to affix or to permit his seal and signature to be affixed to any documents after the license of the licensee named thereon has expired or has been retired, suspended, or revoked, unless said license shall have been renewed, reinstated, or reissued, or for the purpose of aiding or abetting any other person to evade or attempt to evade any portion of this chapter.\n\n(a) The seal may be a rubber stamp, crimp or electronically generated image.

Any such document presented to a client or public or governmental agency that is not final and does not contain a seal, signature and date shall be clearly marked as \"draft,\" \"not for construction\" or with similar words to distinguish the document from a final document. In the event the final work product is preliminary in nature or contains the word \"preliminary,\" such as a \"preliminary engineering report,\" the final work product shall be sealed, signed and dated as a final document if the document is intended to be relied upon to make policy decisions important to the life, health, property, or fiscal interest of the public.\n\n(c) The seal and signature of the licensee and date shall be placed on all original documents in such a manner that such seal, signature and date are reproduced when the original document is copied. The application of the licensee’s seal and signature and the date shall constitute certification that the work thereon was done by him or under his responsible charge. Each plan or drawing sheet shall be sealed and signed and dated by the licensee or licensees responsible for each sheet. In the case of a business entity, each plan or drawing sheet shall be sealed and signed and dated by the licensee or licensees involved. Copies of electronically produced documents, listed in paragraph (b) of this subsection, distributed for informational uses such as for bidding purposes or working copies, may be issued with the licensee’s seal and a notice that the original document is on file with the licensee’s signature and the date. The words \"Original Signed By:\" and \"Date Original Signed:\" shall be placed adjacent to or across the seal on the electronic original.
