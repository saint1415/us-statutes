Subsequent to designating a home state, the individual shall only change their home state through application for licensure in the new state.\n\nADVERSE ACTIONS\n\nA. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to:\n\n1. Take adverse action against an audiologist’s or speech-language pathologist’s privilege to practice within that member state.\n\n2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.

In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.\n\nC. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of an audiologist or speech-language pathologist who changes primary state of residence during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions.\n\nD. If otherwise permitted by state law, the member state may recover from the affected audiologist or speech-language pathologist the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that audiologist or speech-language pathologist.\n\nE. The member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the member state follows the member state’s own procedures for taking the adverse action.\n\nF. Joint investigations:\n\n1. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective audiology or speech-language pathology practice act or other applicable state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.\n\n2. Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.\n\nG. If adverse action is taken by the home state against an audiologist’s or speech-language pathologist’s license, the audiologist’s or speech-language pathologist’s privilege to practice in all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an audiologist’s or speech-language pathologist’s license shall include a statement that the audiologist’s or speech-language pathologist’s privilege to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.\n\nH. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system.
