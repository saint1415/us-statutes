If the individual so designated has a license refused, revoked, suspended or otherwise made inactive by the commission, or if the individual designated broker voluntarily surrenders the individual license or ceases to be connected with the entity in the manner required above, the business entity shall have ten (10) business days in which to designate another qualified individual as designated broker before the entity’s license is terminated, and the licenses of all associated licensees are made inactive.\n\n(e) One (1) individual may act as designated broker for more than one (1) licensed business entity, however, all entities shall have their main offices in the same physical location.\n\n(f) Satisfactory proof of mandatory errors and omissions insurance shall be provided for both the individual designated broker and the licensed business entity.\n\n(g) A legal business entity doing business under an assumed name shall provide satisfactory proof of having legally filed a certificate of assumed name with the Idaho secretary of state.\n\n(2) Sole proprietorships.

The Idaho broker must be in charge of the transaction from beginning to end. Any entrusted moneys received in a cooperative transaction may be handled only by the cooperating Idaho broker in accordance with section 54-2041, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) Each out-of-state broker or out-of-state sales associate, while cooperating with an Idaho broker, is governed by the provisions of this chapter. Any violation of a provision of this chapter by the out-of-state broker or out-of-state sales associate subjects the out-of-state licensee and the Idaho broker to disciplinary action in accordance with this chapter.\n\n(8) An out-of-state broker may cooperate with only one (1) Idaho broker and an Idaho broker may cooperate with only one (1) out-of-state broker per commercial real estate transaction.

Each certified course provider shall at all times be in compliance with state and federal laws, rules and regulations regarding all aspects of equal opportunity and protection of civil rights. No course provider shall engage in discriminatory practices, nor allow their course instructor, or method of delivery to violate laws prohibiting discrimination. Each course provider will fully comply with any requirements of the Americans with disabilities act regarding access to and delivery of its courses, including the provision of accessible facilities and reasonable accommodations for students.\n\n(2) Open access to course offerings. Registration and attendance at all certified courses offered for credit toward the education requirements of this chapter shall be open to all persons meeting normal course prerequisites; provided however, a certified course provider located in or affiliated with a licensed real estate brokerage company or professional association may refuse access to any licensee or unlicensed person based on that licensee’s or unlicensed person’s affiliation with another organization or brokerage company, or the licensee’s or unlicensed person’s membership status in any professional organization unless such course provider has received financial support from the commission for its particular course offering. Nothing in this section shall restrict a course provider from charging a separate and reasonable course fee to nonaffiliated or nonmember licensees or unlicensed persons.\n\n(3) Disclosure of fees. All fees charged to a student by a course provider shall be specified separately in writing. If additional fees are charged for supplies, materials or books required for coursework, such fees shall be itemized by the provider and, upon payment of such fees, the supplies, materials or books shall become the property of the student. All fees and the manner in which they are to be paid shall be stated in a student contract, in a form approved by the commission. The student contract shall expressly include the provider’s policy regarding the return of fees in the instance where the student is dismissed or voluntarily withdraws from the course.\n\n(4) Facilities and supportive personnel. The provider shall provide the facilities and all supportive qualified personnel or approved proctors necessary to adequately implement its real estate program.\n\n(5) Student records and other requirements. Each Idaho certified course provider shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n(a) Records. For each individual student, create and retain for a period of five (5) years, a complete, accurate and detailed record which shall include the total number of hours of instruction undertaken and satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily completed in the area of study;\n\n(b) Course completion lists. Within five (5) business days after conclusion of each course of instruction, the provider shall submit to the council or commission, in the form and manner designated by the commission, a list that shall include the legal names and social security numbers or, if licensed, the license numbers, of the students completing the course of instruction, the name of the course, the name of the instructor, the number of hours included in the course, the date of the course and the location. The list shall be certified by the instructor from whom the students received instruction and an authorized representative of the provider;\n\n(c) Grades. The provider will provide written notification to students who successfully or unsuccessfully complete a course within thirty (30) days of the course completion date;\n\n(d) Evaluations. Upon the conclusion of each course, the provider shall collect written evaluations from students for the course and instructor using an evaluation form approved by the commission. The provider shall keep such evaluations for a period of one (1) year from the course completion date. Upon written request from the commission, the provider shall submit either the student evaluations for the course and instructor or a written summary of those evaluations using a form approved by the commission; and\n\n(e) Course schedules. Each provider shall submit schedules of courses and instructors as requested by the commission and submit changes promptly as they occur. Whenever there is a change in a course including, but not limited to, a change in curriculum, course length or instructor, the provider shall promptly notify the commission in writing of the change.\n\n(6) Instructors. A certified provider may offer a continuing education elective course without obtaining approval or certification for the course instructor; provided however, the provider shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the instructor is competent to teach the course and shall maintain resumes or other biographical information that documents the qualifications of the instructor. The provider shall make such documentation available to the public and commission upon written request. A course provider shall not offer for credit any course that is being taught below the minimum teaching standards established by the commission or that is being taught in a manner that is detrimental to the purpose of educating licensees.\n\n(7) Posting and recording fees. The commission may require that course providers pay to the commission a nonrefundable posting and recording fee to defray normal expenses incurred in maintaining the certificate program. The fee amount shall be established by the commission by motion.\n\n(8) Advertising restrictions:\n\n(a) Providers may advertise that they are currently certified by the commission, if current certification has been approved, but no such advertising may state or imply that the provider is an agency of the commission or the council;\n\n(b) No course provider shall provide any information to the public or to prospective students which is misleading in nature. Information is misleading when, taken as a whole, there is distinct probability that it will deceive the persons whom it is intended to influence.\n\n(9) Changes in certification. Certification shall be granted to the particular provider for the specific ownership, provider location, and named individual in charge as designated in the application for certification. Any changes in ownership, provider location, or provider name, or named individual in charge must be submitted for approval to the commission, at least one (1) month in advance of the effective date of the proposed changes.\n\n[54-2027, added 2000, ch. 285, sec. 3, p. 926; am. 2001, ch. 123, sec. 12, p. 431; am. 2005, ch. 107, sec. 8, p. 348; am. 2006, ch. 166, sec. 6, p. 510; am. 2007, ch. 98, sec. 6, p. 294; am. 2008, ch. 142, sec. 4, p. 412; am. 2010, ch. 213, sec. 3, p. 464; am. 2015, ch. 51, sec. 4, p. 117.]",

In order that the financial interests of the consumers of Idaho be adequately protected, each designated broker is required to create and maintain the following records regarding any real estate trust account, and is required to reconcile and balance each trust account with all ledger records, the check register and the bank statement at least once each month. Any electronic recordkeeping system is required to have a generally accepted and adequate backup system in use at all times.\n\n(1) Maintenance ledger record. A separate ledger card or record, herein called \"ledgers,\" identified as \"trust account maintenance fund\" shall be initiated when the broker’s or firm’s funds are initially deposited into the trust account. These ledgers shall be filed at all times with the broker’s current \"open\" ledgers of pending transactions. Additions or deductions to trust account maintenance funds shall be posted to the ledger records as soon as the broker is given notice of the deposit or deduction. The balance on this maintenance fund ledger shall be kept current at all times.\n\n(2) Individual trust ledger records. An individual trust ledger shall be immediately created whenever a broker, or any licensed or unlicensed person representing the broker, receives earnest money or other consideration, even if the consideration will be deposited with, held by, paid directly to, transferred or delivered to a title company, other approved depository, or any other person, as directed in writing, and signed by both parties to the transaction. Receipt of consideration, for purposes of this chapter, occurs when the broker or any person representing the broker, takes physical possession of the consideration or assumes the responsibility to deliver or deposit it.\n\n(3) When a broker deposits funds with another broker, an approved depository, or directly to the seller or any other person, as directed in writing by both parties to the transaction, a ledger record must be created by the transferring broker, with a transaction number assigned.

Ledger records shall be kept in alphabetical order or by transaction number. Ledger posting must be kept current at all times.\n\n(5) Trust account checks. The broker shall maintain consecutively numbered checks for each trust account, which checks must:\n\n(a) Contain the broker’s licensed business name and current business address; and\n\n(b) Be imprinted with the words \"real estate trust account.\"\n\n(6) Check register or journal. A check register or journal must be posted properly, maintained and kept current by the broker at all times even if funds are held at a title company or other approved depository.

Communicating a company’s relocation policy or benefits to a transferring employee or consumer shall not be considered a violation of this subsection so long as the communication does not involve advice or encouragement on how to terminate or amend an existing contractual relationship between a broker and client.\n\n(5) Double contracts prohibited. No licensed broker or salesperson shall use, propose the use of, agree to the use of, or knowingly permit the use of a double contract, as defined in section 54-2004, Idaho Code, in connection with any regulated real estate transaction. Such conduct by a licensee shall be deemed flagrant misconduct and dishonorable and dishonest dealing and shall subject the licensee to disciplinary action by the commission.\n\n(6) Kickbacks and rebates prohibited. No licensed real estate broker or salesperson shall receive a kickback or rebate for directing any transaction to any individual for financing. A licensee shall not receive a kickback or unearned fee for directing any transaction to any lending institution, escrow or title company, as those practices are defined and prohibited by the real estate settlement procedures act. However, a licensee legally receiving any fee or rebate from any person providing direct services to either the buyer or the seller in connection with a regulated real estate transaction is required to disclose the licensee’s intent to receive such fee, rebate or compensation in writing to all parties to the transaction prior to closing.\n\n(7) Compensation from more than one party. No licensed real estate broker or salesperson shall charge or accept compensation from more than one (1) party in any one (1) transaction, without first making full disclosure in writing of the broker’s intent to do so, to all parties involved in the transaction.\n\n(8) After-the-fact referral fees prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or request a referral fee or similar payment from a licensed Idaho real estate broker or sales associate, for the referral of a buyer or seller in connection with a regulated real estate transaction, unless the person seeking the referral fee has reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause\" shall not exist unless:\n\n(a) The person seeking the referral fee has a written contractual relationship with the Idaho real estate broker for a referral fee or similar payment; and\n\n(b) The contractual relationship providing for the referral fee exists at the time the buyer or seller purportedly referred by such person signs a written agreement with the Idaho broker for the listing of the real estate or for representation by the broker, or the buyer signs an offer to purchase the real estate involved in the transaction. It shall be unlawful for any person including, but not limited to, a relocation company or company with a relocation policy or benefits, to directly or indirectly threaten to or actually reduce or withhold promised or expected employee or customer relocation benefits from a buyer or seller in a regulated real estate transaction based upon a broker’s participation in payment of a referral fee or other fee.\n\n(9) All fees must be paid through broker. No sales associate shall accept any commission, compensation or fee for the performance of any acts requiring a real estate license from any person except the real estate broker with whom the sales associate is licensed. However, if authorized by the broker, a sales associate may:\n\n(a) Pay all or any portion of the accepted commission, compensation or fee to any other sales associate who is licensed with the same broker; or\n\n(b) Accept payment from an unlicensed entity paid by the broker in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.\n\nA broker may pay a former sales associate for services performed while the sales associate was actively licensed with that broker, regardless of the former sales associate’s license status at the time the commission or fee is actually paid.\n\n[54-2054, added 2000, ch. 285, sec. 3, p. 941; am. 2000, ch. 261, sec. 1, p. 732; am. 2002, ch. 220, sec. 10, p. 618; am. 2003, ch. 65, sec. 6, p. 218; am. 2015, ch. 73, sec. 1, p. 192.]",

Upon receipt of a written complaint from anyone who claims to have been injured or defrauded as a result of such action, or upon information received by the executive director, the executive director shall perform an investigation of the facts alleged against such real estate broker or salesperson or such unlicensed person. Prior to the initiation of any proceedings for the revocation or suspension of a license, or for such other disciplinary actions as set forth in section 54-2059, Idaho Code, the executive director shall transmit to the commission a report, in writing, signed by the executive director, setting forth the facts alleged against such real estate broker or salesperson or unlicensed person. Upon receiving such report, the commission shall make an examination of all the facts and circumstances connected with such report. If the facts set forth in the report are deemed insufficient by the commission, no further action shall be taken, unless the executive director resubmits the report with additional facts supporting the filing of an administrative complaint. Should the commission deem that the facts set forth in the report are sufficient to proceed with a formal action, the commission shall authorize the filing of an administrative complaint against such person.\n\n(2) Audits. The commission or its duly authorized representative is vested with the authority to conduct periodic inspections, surveys and audits of the transaction records and real estate trust accounts of all Idaho licensed designated brokers. Any transaction records or real estate trust account records located outside the state of Idaho shall promptly be made available to the commission upon request at the licensee’s own cost and at the location or in the manner requested by the commission. If the analysis of a broker’s real estate trust account indicates a deficiency or any irregularity which cannot be resolved between the commission and the broker, the commission may order a complete audit of the trust account by a certified public accountant at the broker’s expense.\n\n(3) The commission also has the authority to investigate the action of any Idaho licensee as provided in this section.

(1) When any person obtains a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction against any licensee under this chapter, upon grounds of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit with reference to any transaction for which a license is required under this chapter, such person may, upon termination of all proceedings, including appeals in connection with any judgment, file a verified petition in the court in which the judgment was entered for an order directing payment out of the real estate recovery fund in the amount of actual damages included in the judgment and unpaid, but not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per licensee per calendar year. The recovery fund’s liability for all claims arising from the acts or omissions of any one (1) licensee in any calendar year shall be limited to a payment of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), regardless of the number of persons damaged by the acts or omissions of a licensee, or the total amount of damage caused by such licensee, in any one (1) calendar year. If a claim is made against the fund and the commission has actual knowledge of any other claims against the recovery fund which have been filed or asserted against the same licensee and arise from acts or omissions of the licensee in the same calendar year, then the commission shall file an interpleader action in accordance with the applicable statutes and the Idaho rules of civil procedure against all known parties who may claim a right to payment from the fund. Unless the commission has actual knowledge of other potential claims, as stated above, and so files the interpleader action, the first person who obtains a final judgment against a licensee shall be entitled to the payment of that amount equal to the lesser of the judgment or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), providing the claimant meets the other criteria set forth herein.\n\n(2) A copy of the petition shall be served upon the commission and an affidavit of such service shall be filed with the court.\n\n(3) The court shall act upon such petition within thirty (30) days after such service and, upon the hearing thereof, the petitioner shall be required to show that:\n\n(a) He is not the spouse of the debtor, or the personal representative of such spouse;\n\n(b) He has complied with all the requirements of sections 54-2069 through 54-2078, Idaho Code;\n\n(c) He has obtained a judgment of the kind described in subsection (1) of this section, stating the amount thereof and the amount owing thereon at the date of the petition;\n\n(d) He has caused to be issued a writ of execution upon the judgment and the officer executing the same has made a return showing that no personal or real property of the judgment debtor liable to be levied upon in satisfaction of the judgment could be found, or that the amount realized on the sale of them or of such of them as were found, under the execution, was insufficient to satisfy the judgment, stating the amount so realized and the balance remaining due on the judgment after application thereon of the amount realized;\n\n(e) He has made all reasonable searches and inquiries to ascertain whether the judgment debtor is possessed of real or personal property or other assets liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the judgment; and\n\n(f) That by such search he has discovered no personal or real property or other assets liable to be sold or applied, or that he has discovered certain of them, describing them, owned by the judgment debtor and liable to be so applied, and that he has taken all necessary action and proceedings for the realization thereof, and that the amount thereby realized was insufficient to satisfy the judgment, stating the amount so realized and the balance remaining due on the judgment after application of the amount realized.\n\n(4) Whenever the aggrieved person satisfies the court that it is not practicable to comply with one (1) or more of the requirements enumerated in subsections (3)(d), (e) and (f) of this section, and that the aggrieved person has taken all reasonable steps to collect that amount of the judgment or the unsatisfied part thereof and has been unable to collect the same, the court may in its discretion dispense with the necessity for complying with such requirements.\n\n[54-2071, added 2000, ch. 285, sec. 3, p. 949.]",

This duty may be satisfied by any appropriate method suitable to the transaction or, when deemed necessary by the real estate licensee, by advising the client to consult with an accountant, lawyer, or other professional as dictated by the transaction.\n\n(5) To properly account for moneys or property placed in the care and responsibility of the brokerage pursuant to section 54-2041, Idaho Code; and\n\n(6) To maintain the confidentiality of specific client information as defined by and to the extent required in this chapter, and as follows:\n\n(a) The duty to a client continues beyond the termination of representation only so long as the information continues to be confidential client information as defined in this chapter, and only so long as the information does not become generally known in the marketing community from a source other than the brokerage or its associated licensees;\n\n(b) A licensee who personally has gained confidential client information about a buyer or seller while associated with one (1) broker and who later associates with a different broker remains obligated to maintain the client confidentiality as required by this chapter;\n\n(c) If a brokerage represents a buyer or seller whose interests conflict with those of a former client, the brokerage shall inform the second client of the brokerage’s prior representation of the former client and that confidential client information obtained during the first representation cannot be given to the second client. Nothing in this section shall prevent the brokerage from asking the former client for permission to release such information;\n\n(d) Nothing in this section is intended to create a privileged communication between any client and any brokerage or licensee for purposes of civil, criminal or administrative legal proceedings.\n\n(7) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, a brokerage and its licensees owe no duty to a client to conduct an independent inspection of the property and owe no duty to independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any statement or representation made regarding a property. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, a brokerage and its licensees owe no duty to conduct an independent investigation of either party’s financial ability to complete a real estate transaction.\n\n(8) The duties set forth in this section are mandatory and may not be waived or abrogated, either unilaterally or by agreement.\n\n(9) Nothing in this section prohibits a brokerage from charging a separate fee or commission for each service provided to the client in the transaction.\n\n(10) Nothing in this section shall result in imputed knowledge between multiple licensees of the brokerage when neither has reason to have such knowledge.\n\n(11) A brokerage and its licensees may represent two (2) or more buyers who wish to make an offer for the purchase of the same real property; provided, that the brokerage or its licensee has advised all such buyers in writing of the same.\n\n[(54-2087) 54-2065, added 1996, ch. 250, sec. 1, p. 788; am. and redesignated 2000, ch. 285, sec. 9, p. 955; am. 2001, ch. 123, sec. 26, p. 442; am. 2003, ch. 243, sec. 1, p. 627; am. 2004, ch. 119, sec. 4, p. 399; am. 2007, ch. 150, sec. 3, p. 459; am. 2009, ch. 133, sec. 1, p. 414.]",

(1) A brokerage may represent both the buyer and the seller in the same transaction only as a limited dual agent and only with the express written consent of all other clients involved in the transaction.\n\n(2) A brokerage acting as a limited dual agent may, at the option of the brokerage and with the express written consent of the other clients involved in the transaction, assign separate sales associates to each client to act on behalf of and represent that client solely. The designated broker shall not act as an assigned agent of the brokerage.\n\n(3) The express written consent to limited dual agency shall contain separate signatures of all clients involved in the transaction and shall contain the following language:\n\nCONSENT TO LIMITED DUAL REPRESENTATION AND ASSIGNED AGENCY\n\nThe undersigned have received, read and understand the Agency Disclosure Brochure. The undersigned understand that the brokerage involved in this transaction may be providing agency representation to both the buyer and the seller. The undersigned each understands that, as an agent for both buyer/client and seller/client, a brokerage will be a limited dual agent of each client and cannot advocate on behalf of one client over another, and cannot legally disclose to either client certain confidential client information concerning price negotiations, terms or factors motivating the buyer/client to buy or the seller/client to sell without specific written permission of the client to whom the information pertains. The specific duties, obligations and limitations of a limited dual agent are contained in the Agency Disclosure Brochure as required by Section 54-2085, Idaho Code. The undersigned each understands that a limited dual agent does not have a duty of undivided loyalty to either client.\n\nThe undersigned further acknowledge that, to the extent the brokerage firm offers assigned agency as a type of agency representation, individual sales associates may be assigned to represent each client to act solely on behalf of the client consistent with applicable duties set forth in Section 54-2087, Idaho Code. In an assigned agency situation, the designated broker (the broker who supervises the sales associates) will remain a limited dual agent of the client and shall have the duty to supervise the assigned agents in the fulfillment of their duties to their respective clients, to refrain from advocating on behalf of any one client over another, and to refrain from disclosing or using, without permission, confidential information of any other client with whom the brokerage has an agency relationship.\n\n(4) All duties and obligations owed to a buyer/client or a seller/client under section 54-2087, Idaho Code, apply to limited dual agency relationships to the extent they do not unreasonably conflict with duties and obligations owed to the other client, except that:\n\n(a) A limited dual agent shall not disclose any of the following without express written consent of the client to whom the information pertains:\n\n(i) That a buyer is willing to pay more than the listing price of the property;\n\n(ii) That a seller is willing to accept less than the listing price for the property;\n\n(iii) The factors motivating the buyer to buy or the seller to sell;\n\n(iv) That a buyer or seller will agree to a price or financing terms other than those offered.\n\n(b) A limited dual agent does not have a duty of undivided loyalty to either buyer/client or seller/client, and by consenting to limited dual agency, the buyer and seller agree to those limitations.\n\n(5) The following apply whenever a brokerage acting as a limited dual agent assigns separate sales associates to act on behalf of the separate clients:\n\n(a) Designated broker. The designated broker continues to act as limited dual agent of each client with the duty to:\n\n(i) Supervise the assigned agents in the fulfillment of their duties to their respective clients;\n\n(ii) Refrain from advocating on behalf of any one client over another; and\n\n(iii) Refrain from disclosing or using, without permission, confidential information of any other client with whom the brokerage has an agency relationship.\n\n(b) Imputed knowledge. Knowledge of any fact known to the brokerage, its designated broker, or any other licensee associated with the brokerage, shall not be imputed to an assigned agent of the brokerage so as to create an impermissible conflict of interest. Nothing in this subsection shall diminish a licensee’s duty with respect to facts actually known or that reasonably should have been known to the licensee.\n\n(6) If a designated broker determines that confidential information of a client has been disclosed to another client in the transaction in violation of this section, the designated broker shall promptly provide written notice of the disclosure to the affected client.\n\n(7) No cause of action for any buyer or seller shall arise against a limited dual agent for making any required or permitted disclosure under this act, nor does making such disclosure terminate the limited dual agency.\n\n(8) Receipt of the agency disclosure brochure required by section 54-2085, Idaho Code, and the signed consent to dual representation by buyer and seller agreeing to limited dual agency representation shall be sufficient informed legal consent to dual representation under this act. A consent by the buyer and seller to possible dual representation in the future, such as may be contained in a written marketing or representation agreement between a brokerage and client, shall also be considered effective and informed legal consent to dual representation.\n\n[(54-2088) 54-2066, added 1996, ch. 250, sec. 1, p. 789; am. and redesignated 2000, ch. 285, sec. 10, p. 956; am. 2004, ch. 119, sec. 5, p. 400.]",
