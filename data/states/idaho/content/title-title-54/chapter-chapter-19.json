Under such rules as the board may adopt, the administrator shall have the power and authority to investigate, classify, and to qualify applicants for licenses under this chapter, by written or oral examinations, or both.\n\nThe qualifications to be required of an applicant by the board are as follows:\n\n(a) Such degree of experience, and such general knowledge of the building, safety, health and lien laws of the state, and of the rudimentary administrative principles of the contracting business, as may be deemed necessary by the board for the safety and protection of the public. The applicant if an individual may qualify as to the aforementioned experience and knowledge by personal appearance or by the appearance of his responsible managing employee, and if a copartnership or corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership and any other combination or organization, by the appearance of the responsible managing officer or member of the personnel of such applicant. If the person qualifying by examination as to experience and knowledge shall, for any reason whatsoever, cease to be connected with the licensee to whom the license is issued, such licensee shall so notify the administrator in writing within ten (10) days from such cessation. If such notice is given, the license shall remain in force for a reasonable length of time, to be determined by rules of the board. If such licensee fails to so notify the administrator within said ten (10) day period, then at the end of such ten (10) day period the license of such licensee shall be automatically suspended. A suspended license shall be reinstated upon the filing with the administrator of an affidavit executed by the licensee or a member of the suspended firm, to the effect that the individual originally examined for the firm has been replaced by another individual who has been qualified by examination as herein provided, and who shall not have had a license suspended or revoked, nor have been connected with any licensee who has had a license suspended or revoked for reasons that should preclude him from personally qualifying as to good character as herein required of an applicant.\n\n(b) The possession by the applicant of good character. Lack of character may be established by showing any of the following:\n\n(1) That the applicant has committed or done any act which, if committed or done by any licensed contractor, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a contractor’s license; or\n\n(2) That the applicant has committed or done any act involving dishonesty, fraud or deceit whereby the applicant has been benefited or whereby some injury has been sustained by another; or\n\n(3) That the applicant bears a bad reputation for honesty and integrity; or\n\n(4) That the applicant has been convicted of a crime that is deemed relevant in accordance with section 67-9411(1), Idaho Code.\n\n(c) That he has never been refused a license or had a license revoked for reasons that would preclude the granting of the license applied for.\n\n(d) No license shall be issued to a corporation, copartnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or other combination or organization if any responsible officer of such corporation, or other combination or organization, or any member of such copartnership does not meet the qualifications required of an applicant other than those qualifications relating to knowledge and experience.\n\n(e) To obtain an original license under this chapter, the applicant shall submit to the administrator, on such forms as the administrator shall prescribe, accompanied by the required fee for the class of license applied for, and in accordance with such rules as may be deemed necessary and adopted by the board in order to carry out the foregoing provisions of this section, a sworn written application for such license, containing the statement that the applicant desires the issuance of a license under the terms of this chapter. The information contained in such application forms shall include a complete statement of the general nature of the applicant’s contracting business, and stating concisely the applicant’s experience and qualifications as a contractor; the value and character of contract work completed and for whom performed during the three (3) year period prior to filing the application; a general description of the applicant’s machinery and equipment; a complete financial statement that may include a letter from the applicant’s bonding company stating the amount of the applicant’s bonding capability per project and in the aggregate, on such forms and disclosing such information as shall be required by the administrator, together with such additional information as may be required by the administrator to determine the applicant’s fitness for a license under this chapter. The application shall contain, if by an individual, the individual’s name, social security number and business address; if by a copartnership, its business address and the names and addresses of all partners; and if by a corporation, association, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or other organization, its business address and the names and addresses of the president, vice president, secretary, and chief construction managing officers, or responsible managing employee.

(1) Any person, firm, copartnership, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, association or other organization acting in the capacity of a public works contractor within the meaning of this chapter, without a license as herein provided or fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (1), (2) or (3) of section 67-2310, Idaho Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not to exceed one (1) year or by both such fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the court. The same penalties shall apply, upon conviction to any member of a copartnership, or to any construction, managing or directing officer of any corporation, limited liability company or limited liability partnership, or other organization consenting to, participating in, or aiding or abetting any such violation of this chapter.\n\n(2) Every public officer who knowingly lets a public contract to any person, firm, copartnership, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, association or other organization who does not hold a license as required by the provisions of this chapter or knowingly fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) or (2) of section 67-2310, Idaho Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, punishable as provided in this section, unless, however, there be no qualified bidder willing to undertake the public works covered by the contract. No person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any action in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract for which a license is required by this chapter without alleging and providing that he was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of such act or contract.\n\n(3) In addition to any other penalties specified in this section, whenever any person violates the provisions of this chapter by acting as a public works contractor without a license, the administrator may maintain an action in the name of the state of Idaho to enjoin the person from any further violations. Such action may be brought either in the county in which the acts are claimed to have been or are being committed, in the county where the defendant resides or in Ada county. Upon the filing of a verified complaint in the district court, the court, if satisfied that the acts complained of have been or probably are being or may be committed, may issue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, without bond, enjoining the defendant from the commission of any such act or acts constituting the violation. A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the defendant and the proceedings shall thereafter be conducted as in other similar civil actions. If the commission of the act or acts is established, the court shall enter a decree permanently enjoining the defendant from committing such act or acts. If an injunction issued under the provisions of this section is violated, the court, or the judge thereof at chambers, may summarily try and punish the offender for contempt of court.\n\n[54-1920, added 1941, ch. 115, sec. 21, p. 212; am. 1955, ch. 223, sec. 8, p. 480; am. 1969, ch. 18, sec. 5, p. 30; am. 1999, ch. 201, sec. 22, p. 544; am. 2000, ch. 318, sec. 2, p. 1074; am. 2002, ch. 127, sec. 2, p. 356; am. 2007, ch. 127, sec. 2, p. 383.]",
