      "text": "54-303. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Architect\" means a person who engages in the practice of architecture as defined in this section and is licensed under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) \"Architectural intern\" means a person enrolled in a national council of architectural registration boards architectural experience program and who, in fulfillment of the requirements of that program, is working under the direct supervision of an architect licensed under this chapter.\n\n(3) \"Board\" means the board of architects and landscape architects.\n\n(4) \"Building\" means an enclosure, including related improvements, that has as its principal purpose the adaptation of space for occupancy or habitation by human beings.\n\n(5) \"Practice of architecture\" means rendering or offering those services described in this subsection in connection with the design, construction, enlargement or alteration of a building or a group of buildings. The services covered within this definition include architectural planning, advice and consultation; submitting a response to any request for qualification, request for proposal, or other solicitation for services within the state; providing preliminary studies; architectural designs, drawings and specifications; technical submissions; and administration of construction contracts.\n\n(6) \"Prototypical building\" means any commercial building or space within a commercial building that is intended to be constructed in multiple locations, that has been constructed in multiple locations and that conveys an owner’s intended uniform business program, plan or image.\n\n(7) \"Prototypical building documents\" means technical submissions for prototypical buildings that:\n\n(a) Are prepared by or under the responsible control of an architect licensed in any jurisdiction and holding the certification issued by the national council of architectural registration boards;\n\n(b) Identify the architect, together with the architect’s license number and jurisdiction or the architect’s license and national council of architectural registration boards certification number; and\n\n(c) Are marked \"prototypical design documents not for construction.\" Prototypical building documents do not comprise a final, comprehensive set of design and construction documents because a prototypical building also requires adaptations for local conditions, including site conditions, and may require additional design.\n\n(8) \"Responsible control\" means that amount of control over and detailed knowledge of the content of technical submissions during their preparation as is ordinarily exercised by registered architects applying the required professional standard of care. Reviewing, or reviewing and correcting, technical submissions after they have been prepared by others does not constitute the exercise of responsible control because the reviewer has neither control over nor detailed knowledge of the content of such submissions throughout their preparation.\n\n(9) \"Technical submissions\" involving the practice of architecture consist of designs, drawings, specifications, studies and other technical reports prepared in the course of practicing architecture.\n\n[54-303, added 2018, ch. 129, sec. 2, p. 270; am. 2022, ch. 42, sec. 1, p. 105; am. 2024, ch. 35, sec. 1, p. 236.]",

Whenever the seal is applied to a technical submission, the signature of the architect and the date thereof shall be written adjacent to or across the seal. The signature, date and seal shall appear on all technical submissions prepared by the architect or that meet the requirements set forth in subsection (4) of this section. Only the title page of reports, specifications and like documents must bear the date and the seal and signature of the architect.

Any licensed architect signing or sealing technical submissions integrating the work of another architect into the registered architect’s own work, as permitted under subsection (4)(c) or (d) of this section, shall maintain adequate and complete records demonstrating the nature and extent of the registered architect’s review of and integration of the work of the other architect into his own technical submissions and that such review and integration met the required professional standard of care.
