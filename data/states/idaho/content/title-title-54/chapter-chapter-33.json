Whenever any person, corporation, partnership or association of any kind or nature violates any of the provisions of this act, the board, without regard to criminal prosecution, may maintain an action in the name of the state of Idaho to enjoin said person, corporation, partnership or association from any further violations, such action to be brought either in the county in which said acts are claimed to have been or are being committed, in the county where the defendant resides, or in Ada county. Upon the filing of a verified complaint in the district court, the court, if satisfied that the acts complained of have been or probably are being or may be committed, may issue an injunction pendente lite without bond, on request of the board, enjoining the defendant from the commission of any such act or acts constituting said violations. A copy of said complaint shall be served upon the defendant, and the proceedings shall thereafter be conducted as in any other similar civil action. If the commission of said act or acts be established, the court shall enter a decree perpetually enjoining said defendant from committing said act or acts. In case of violation of any injunction issued under the provisions of this section, the court, or the judge thereof at chambers, may summarily try and punish the offender for his contempt of court.\n\n[54-3323, added 1988, ch. 133, sec. 6, p. 240.]",
