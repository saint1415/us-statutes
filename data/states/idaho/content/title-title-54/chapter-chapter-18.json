A physician may request in writing to the board a restriction of his license to practice medicine and the board is authorized to grant such request and, if it deems it appropriate to do so, to attach conditions to the licensure of the physician to practice medicine. The board is also authorized in such cases thereafter to waive the commencement of proceedings under this act or other provisions of the medical practice act if in the interest of justice it determines that such voluntary restrictions have rendered the same unnecessary.

The board may temporarily suspend or restrict the license of any physician or physician assistant on its own motion or on verified petition of any person, pending further or final order, without prior hearing, simultaneously with or at any time after the institution of proceedings under this chapter, if it finds, that the physician or physician assistant, for reasons set forth by petition, affidavit, or other verified showing, or determined in reliance upon other reliable proof, is causing great harm to the public or to any patient or group of patients, or is imminently likely to cause such harm, for which reason he or she and his or her license to practice medicine should be immediately suspended or restricted or he or she should be specially controlled, suspended in or restricted from the practice of medicine. Thereafter the physician or physician assistant may, for good cause, request dissolution or amendment of any such temporary order by petition filed with the board, which petition shall be set for prompt hearing before a designated hearing officer, which officer shall forthwith hear said matter and report to the board his report and recommendations. The board, consistent with due process and the administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, shall rule on such petition for dissolution or amendment with the least amount of delay reasonably possible.\n\n(11) Judicial Review.

In order to strengthen access to health care and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the interstate medical licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state’s existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.\n\n[54-1843, added 2015, ch. 105, sec. 1, p. 248.]",
