No other judicial or administrative remedies shall be available to a psychologist in the event a compact state imposes an adverse action pursuant to subsection C of this article.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN A\n\nCOMPACT STATE’S PSYCHOLOGY REGULATORY AUTHORITY\n\nA. In addition to any other powers granted under state law, a compact state’s psychology regulatory authority shall have the authority under this compact to:\n\n1. Issue subpoenas, for both hearings and investigations, that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a compact state’s psychology regulatory authority for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another compact state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing state psychology regulatory authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and\n\n2. Issue cease and desist or injunctive relief orders to revoke a psychologist’s authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology or temporary authorization to practice.\n\nB. During the course of any investigation, a psychologist may not change home state licensure. A home state psychology regulatory authority is authorized to complete any pending investigations of a psychologist and to take any actions appropriate under its law. The home state psychology regulatory authority shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the commission. Once an investigation has been completed, and pending the outcome of said investigation, the psychologist may change home state licensure. The commission shall promptly notify the new home state of any such decisions as provided in the rules of the commission. All information provided to the commission or distributed by compact states pursuant to the psychologist shall be confidential, filed under seal, and used for investigatory or disciplinary matters. The commission may create additional rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by compact states.\n\nCOORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\nA. The commission shall provide for the development and maintenance of a coordinated licensure information system (coordinated database) and reporting system containing licensure and disciplinary action information on all psychologists to whom this compact is applicable in all compact states as defined by the rules of the commission.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a compact state shall submit a uniform data set to the coordinated database on all licensees as required by the rules of the commission, including:\n\n1. Identifying information;\n\n2. Licensure data;\n\n3. Significant investigatory information;\n\n4. Adverse actions against a psychologist’s license;\n\n5. An indicator that a psychologist’s authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology or temporary authorization to practice is revoked;\n\n6. Nonconfidential information related to alternative program participation information;\n\n7. Any denial of application for licensure and the reasons for such denial; and\n\n8. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.\n\nC. The coordinated database administrator shall promptly notify all compact states of any adverse action taken against, or significant investigative information on, any licensee in a compact state.\n\nD. Compact states reporting information to the coordinated database may designate information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the compact state reporting the information.\n\nE. Any information submitted to the coordinated database that is subsequently required to be expunged by the law of the compact state reporting the information shall be removed from the coordinated database.\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION\n\nA. The compact states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the psychology interjurisdictional compact commission.\n\n1. The commission is a body politic and an instrumentality of the compact states.\n\n2. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n3. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nB. Membership, voting, and meetings.\n\n1. The commission shall consist of one (1) voting representative appointed by each compact state to serve as that state’s commissioner. The state psychology regulatory authority shall appoint its delegate. This delegate shall be empowered to act on behalf of the compact state. This delegate shall be limited to:\n\na. Executive director, executive secretary, or similar executive;\n\nb. Current member of the state psychology regulatory authority of a compact state; or\n\nc. Designee empowered with the appropriate delegate authority to act on behalf of the compact state.\n\n2.

Each commissioner shall be entitled to one (1) vote with regard to the promulgation of rules and creation of bylaws and shall otherwise have an opportunity to participate in the business and affairs of the commission. A commissioner shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may provide for commissioners’ participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.\n\n4. The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.\n\n5. All meetings shall be open to the public, and public notice of meetings shall be given in the same manner as required under the rulemaking provisions in article XI of this compact.\n\n6. The commission may convene in a closed nonpublic meeting if the commission must discuss:\n\na. Noncompliance of a compact state with its obligations under the compact;\n\nb.

Matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute.\n\n7. If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed pursuant to this article, the commission’s legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exempting provision. The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken by any person participating in the meeting, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release only by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nC. The commission shall, by a majority vote of the commissioners, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of the compact, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Establishing the fiscal year of the commission;\n\n2. Providing reasonable standards and procedures for the establishment and meetings of other committees and governing any general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the commission;\n\n3.

The rules shall have the force and effect of law and shall be binding in all compact states;\n\n2. To bring and prosecute legal proceedings or actions in the name of the commission, provided that the standing of any state psychology regulatory authority or other regulatory body responsible for psychology licensure to sue or be sued under applicable law shall not be affected;\n\n3. To purchase and maintain insurance and bonds;\n\n4. To borrow, accept, or contract for services of personnel, including but not limited to employees of a compact state;\n\n5.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nI. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nJ. The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\nK.

A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nOVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nA. Oversight.\n\n1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each compact state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.\n\n2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compact state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission.\n\n3. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nB. Default, technical assistance, and termination.\n\n1. If the commission determines that a compact state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other compact states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compact states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the compact states.\n\n4. A compact state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state that are found to be in default or that have been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\nC. Dispute resolution.\n\n1. Upon request by a compact state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among compact states and between compact and non-compact states.\n\n2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the commission.\n\nD. Enforcement.\n\n1. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nDATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS\n\nA. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact is enacted into law in the seventh compact state. The provisions that become effective at that time shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.\n\nB. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.\n\nC. Any compact state may withdraw from this compact by enacting legislation repealing the same.\n\n1. A compact state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing legislation.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s psychology regulatory authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nD. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a compact state and a non-compact state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.\n\nE. This compact may be amended by the compact states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.\n\n[54-2321, added 2022, ch. 129, sec. 1, p. 475.]",
