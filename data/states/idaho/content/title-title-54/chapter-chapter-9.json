The conditions, limitations and requirements imposed by the board may include, but are not limited to, a limitation on the effective period of the license, a requirement that specific conditions must be fulfilled in order for the license to remain effective, a requirement that specified education, examinations and skills testing be successfully completed during the effective period of the license, a restriction on the scope of permissible services that the licensee is authorized to perform, a restriction on the type of patients for whom treatment may be rendered and a restriction on the locations at which the licensee can perform authorized services.\n\n(7)(a) The board may issue a license with active status to any qualified applicant or qualified licensee who is authorized to practice dentistry, dental therapy, or dental hygiene in the state of Idaho.

A license with special status or provisional status entitles the holder thereof to practice dentistry, dental therapy, or dental hygiene in the state of Idaho subject to the conditions, restrictions and limitations specifically determined by the board and for the period of time prescribed. A provisional license is effective for the period specified by the board and may not be renewed.
