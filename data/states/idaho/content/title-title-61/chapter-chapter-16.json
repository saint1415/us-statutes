It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to authorize the public utilities commission to approve certain cost reduction charges or rates as a method of financing or refinancing costs incurred or to be incurred by electric and gas utilities that will accrue benefits to Idaho consumers through reduced utility rates. The legislature believes that this type of securities legislation is in the public interest but should not be considered as endorsement of, or intended to provide, a mechanism for restructuring of the utility industry in the state of Idaho.\n\n[61-1601, added 2005, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1186.]",

      "text": "61-1603. COST REDUCTION ORDER. (1) A public utility may apply to the commission for a cost reduction order authorizing the recovery of approved costs through the imposition and collection of a cost reduction rate.\n\n(2) A public utility may apply to the commission from time to time for a cost reduction order in a manner prescribed by the commission, in separate proceedings for this purpose or in connection with a general rate case. Such application may also include a request for authority to issue and sell cost reduction instruments to be secured by or payable from the cost reduction rate that results from such cost reduction order or the cost reduction property created by this chapter and the cost reduction order related to such cost reduction rate. Upon such an application, if the commission finds that the public interest would be served if the approved costs were recovered through a cost reduction rate, the commission shall issue a cost reduction order to allow the public utility to recover the approved costs through a cost reduction rate and may also provide authority to issue and sell cost reduction instruments.\n\n(3) A cost reduction order shall detail the approved costs to be recovered and the period of time in which recovery of the approved costs is to occur. A cost reduction order shall specify the amount of the cost reduction rate and the method for determining the amount of the cost reduction rate that from time to time will be sufficient to recover all approved costs. Cost reduction rates shall remain in effect until all approved costs have been paid in full.\n\n(4) A cost reduction order may be issued only upon the application of a public utility and shall become effective only in accordance with its terms and conditions. A public utility may withdraw its application for a cost reduction order if it disagrees with any of the terms and conditions of the order within fourteen (14) days of service of a final order on the public utility. A public utility shall effect the withdrawal of its application by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the commission within such time period. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or preclude other remedies that may be available to the public utility under applicable law.\n\n(5) No public utility shall be treated as having acted unreasonably or imprudently by reason of its failure to apply for a cost reduction order, by reason of its withdrawal of an application for a cost reduction order, or by reason of its failure to arrange for the issuance of cost reduction instruments pursuant to a cost reduction order.\n\n(6) Upon issuance of a cost reduction order, a public utility may sell, assign or otherwise transfer or pledge cost reduction property created by this chapter and the applicable cost reduction order, and if authorized by the particular cost reduction order, a public utility or an assignee may issue or cause to be issued cost reduction instruments.\n\n(7) Any cost reduction order, and the approved costs and the cost reduction rates that have been authorized by the commission in such cost reduction order, shall be irrevocable and binding upon the commission. The commission shall not have authority either by rescinding, altering or amending a cost reduction order or otherwise to, either directly or indirectly, revalue or revise for ratemaking purposes the approved costs or the cost reduction rates. Once the commission authorizes a cost reduction rate, it cannot determine in a later proceeding that the cost reduction rate is unjust or unreasonable, or in any way reduce or impair the value of related cost reduction property, either directly or indirectly, by taking the cost reduction rate into account when setting other rates for the public utility; nor shall the amount of revenues arising with respect thereto be subject to reduction, impairment, postponement or termination. The state of Idaho does hereby pledge to and agree with the owners of cost reduction property and with any cost reduction instrument holders that neither the state nor any of its agencies, including the commission, shall (by administrative or legislative action, ballot initiative or other similar process) limit, alter, restrict or impair the approved costs, the cost reduction rate, the cost reduction property, the cost reduction orders or any rights thereunder or ownership thereof or security interest therein or in any way impair the rights or remedies of any cost reduction instrument holders. The state does hereby acknowledge that any cost reduction instrument holders may and will rely on this pledge and agreement and that they would be irreparably harmed by any such limitation, alteration, restriction or impairment without such adequate provision.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission will from time to time, and no less frequently than annually, approve adjustments to the cost reduction rates as may be necessary to ensure timely and complete recovery of all approved costs that are the subject of the pertinent cost reduction order.\n\n(9) Subject to the foregoing limitations, the commission has the same authority with respect to a proposed cost reduction rate as it has with regard to any other tariff, schedule or classification the effect of which is to change any rate or charge, including, without limitation, the power granted by chapter 6, title 61, Idaho Code, to conduct a hearing concerning a proposed cost reduction rate and the reasonableness and justness thereof.\n\n(10) The commission shall establish procedures for the expeditious processing of any application for cost reduction orders and adjustments thereto, including the approval or disapproval of any such orders within forty-five (45) days of the application therefor.\n\n[61-1603, added 2005, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1188.]",

(1) Public utilities and assignees may issue and sell cost reduction instruments upon approval by the commission of such action in a cost reduction order.\n\n(2) Public utilities and assignees may sell and assign all or portions of their interest in cost reduction property that is the basis for the issuance of cost reduction instruments to the extent approved in the pertinent cost reduction order. To the extent approved in the pertinent cost reduction orders, public utilities and assignees may also pledge cost reduction property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for cost reduction instruments providing for a security interest in the cost reduction property, in the manner as set forth in this chapter. Cost reduction property may also be sold or assigned by:\n\n(a) A public utility, an assignee or a trustee for the holders of cost reduction instruments in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default; or\n\n(b) Any person acquiring the cost reduction property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(3) To the extent that any interest in cost reduction property is so sold or assigned, or is so pledged as collateral, the commission may authorize the public utility to contract with an assignee that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts with respect to the cost reduction rates for the benefit and account of the assignee, and will account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the assignee. Contracting with the assignee in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale or security interest, as applicable.\n\n(4) Upon approval by the commission of a cost reduction order, any issuance of cost reduction instruments approved therein, any related transfer or pledge of cost reduction property and any other transactions incidental to such issuance shall be exempt from the requirements of 61-901 through 61-908, Idaho Code. The commission may include in any cost reduction order any additional approvals that may be required in connection with such issuance under applicable law.\n\n(5) An assignee shall not be considered to be an electric or gas corporation solely by virtue of the transactions described in this chapter.\n\n[61-1606, added 2005, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1190.]",

(1) To the extent the provisions of this section conflict with chapter 9 as from time to time in effect, including any successor provisions, this section shall apply.\n\n(2) A security interest in cost reduction property is valid, is enforceable against the pledgor and third parties, subject to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the cost reduction property perfected in the manner described in this section, and attaches when all of the following have occurred:\n\n(a) The commission has issued a cost reduction order authorizing a cost reduction rate, the right to the imposition and collection of which is included in the cost reduction;\n\n(b) Value has been given by the pledgees of the cost reduction property; and\n\n(c) The pledgor has signed a security agreement covering the cost reduction property.\n\n(3) A valid and enforceable security interest in cost reduction property is perfected when it has attached and when a financing statement has been filed in accordance with chapter 9, naming the pledgor of the cost reduction property as \"debtor\" and identifying the cost reduction property. Any description of the cost reduction property shall be sufficient if it refers to the cost reduction order creating the cost reduction property. A copy of the financing statement shall be filed with the commission by the pledgor or transferor of the cost reduction property, and the commission may require the pledgor or transferor to make other filings with respect to the security interest in accordance with procedures it may establish, provided that the filings shall not affect the perfection of the security interest. A financing statement filed pursuant to this section shall remain effective until a termination statement is filed.\n\n(4) A perfected security interest in cost reduction property is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting security interests shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Cost reduction property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing cost reduction instruments, whether or not the revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto have accrued.\n\n(5) Subject to the terms of the security agreement covering the cost reduction property and the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the cost reduction property perfected in the manner described in this section, the validity and relative priority of a security interest created under this section is not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property with other funds of the public utility that is the pledgor or transferor of the cost reduction property, or by any security interest in a deposit account of that public utility perfected under chapter 9, into which the revenues are deposited. Subject to the terms of the security agreement, the pledgees of the cost reduction property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the public utility in which revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property have been commingled with other funds, but the perfected security interest shall be limited to an amount not greater than the amount of the revenues with respect to the cost reduction property received by the public utility within twelve (12) months before: (a) any default under the security agreement, or (b) the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the public utility, less payments from the revenues to the pledgees during that twelve (12) month period.\n\n(6) If an event of default occurs under the security agreement covering the cost reduction property, the pledgees of the cost reduction property, subject to the terms of the security agreement, shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under chapter 9, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interest in the cost reduction property, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the cost reduction property perfected in the manner provided in this section. In addition, the commission may require, in the cost reduction order creating the cost reduction property, that, in the event of default by the public utility in payment of revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the pledgees or transferees, including transferees under section 61-1608, Idaho Code, of the cost reduction property, and without limiting any other remedies available to the pledgees or transferees by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the pledgees or transferees of revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property. Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor or transferor of the cost reduction property.\n\n(7) Cost reduction property shall constitute a payment intangible as that term is defined under chapter 9.\n\n(8) Sections 28-9-204 and 28-9-205, Idaho Code, as from time to time amended, including any successor provisions, shall apply to a pledge of cost reduction property by a public utility, assignee or other issuer.\n\n(9) This section sets forth the terms by which a consensual security interest can be created and perfected in cost reduction property. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission with respect to any series of cost reduction instruments on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this section. Upon the effective date of the cost reduction order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all cost reduction property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the cost reduction order. This lien shall arise by operation of this section automatically without any action on the part of the public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the cost reduction instruments issued pursuant to the cost reduction order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the cost reduction order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the pertinent cost reduction order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under chapter 9, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the cost reduction property. This lien shall attach to the cost reduction property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the cost reduction property including any public utility, any assignee or other issuer, or any other person. This lien shall be valid, perfected, and enforceable against the owner of the cost reduction property and all third parties upon the effectiveness of the cost reduction order without any further public notice; provided however, that any person may, but shall not be required to, file a financing statement in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Financing statements so filed may be \"protective filings\" and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the cost reduction property. A perfected statutory lien in cost reduction property is a continuously perfected lien in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting liens shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. In addition, the commission may require, in the cost reduction order creating the cost reduction property, that, in the event of default by the public utility in payment of revenues arising with respect to cost reduction property, the commission and any successor thereto, upon the application by the beneficiaries of the statutory lien, and without limiting any other remedies available to the beneficiaries by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of revenues arising with respect to the cost reduction property.\n\n[61-1607, added 2005, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1191.]",
