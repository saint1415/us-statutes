In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case. Such corporations or persons as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in such action or proceedings shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction issue or be made permanent as prayed for in the petition, or in such modified or other form as will afford appropriate relief.\n\nAn appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from such final judgment in the same manner and with the same effect, subject to the provisions of this act, as appeals are taken from judgments of the district court in other actions for mandamus or injunction.\n\n[(61-705) 1913, ch. 61, sec. 71, p. 248; reen.
