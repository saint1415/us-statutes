      "text": "61-1802. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. In enacting this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature to provide for the safe, efficient, and reliable generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power at affordable rates and in such ways that protect the public interest, health, safety, and welfare. The legislature recognizes that the public utilities commission oversees electric corporation compliance with applicable Idaho statutes and regulations, and, when applicable, the state-adopted provisions of the national electric safety code. It further recognizes that preparation for and response to wildfire risk is an increasingly important element of planning conducted by electric utilities. Proper preparation is crucial to position electric utilities to avoid and respond to wildfire risk. Knowing what measures should be taken to minimize wildfire risk before a fire occurs and to respond to it when it does occur is central to the affordable, safe, and reliable transmission and distribution of electricity. It is essential to ensure these risks are addressed as needed and within appropriate cost parameters so that electric power is kept affordable to the public. This chapter is designed to direct the prudent use of resources by electric utilities to mitigate and respond to wildfire risk within the costs that can be justified as just and reasonable in order to keep rates affordable to utility customers and protect Idaho residents and their property.\n\n[61-1802, added 2025, ch. 249, sec. 1, p. 1102.]",

      "text": "61-1803. WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. (1) For the purposes of this chapter, \"commission\" means the Idaho public utilities commission.\n\n(2)(a) Each electric corporation that is a public utility as defined in sections 61-119 and 61-129, Idaho Code, shall adopt and file a wildfire mitigation plan with the commission for its review and approval pursuant to section 61-1804, Idaho Code. The commission may order the plans be filed at a date determined by it and may stagger filing dates.\n\n(b) An electric corporation that is not a public utility, including but not limited to a cooperative association distributing electric power to its members or a municipal electric distribution system under section 50-342, Idaho Code, may adopt and file a wildfire mitigation plan with the commission for its review at any time permitted by the commission. If such a plan is filed, the commission may assess reasonable fees to the electrical corporation that is not a public utility for its review. The fee may not exceed the actual reasonable cost incurred by the commission for the review and consideration of a plan submitted to it.\n\n(3) Each wildfire mitigation plan shall be developed using approaches and methods that are designed to protect the public interest and are reflective of and commensurate with the size and complexity of the electric corporation’s operations and of the nature of the fire risk. At a minimum, each wildfire mitigation plan shall identify a means for mitigating wildfire risk that reflect a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with the resulting reduction of wildfire risk, including:\n\n(a) Identifying geographical areas where an electric corporation has infrastructure or equipment that the electric corporation considers may be subject to a heightened risk of wildfire at the time the wildfire mitigation plan is finalized by the electric corporation;\n\n(b) Preventative actions and programs that the electric corporation will carry out to reduce the risk of wildfire;\n\n(c) Community outreach and public awareness efforts that the electric corporation will use before, during, and after wildfire season to identify and inform the public of relevant wildfire risks and notify the public of wildfire-related outages;\n\n(d) Outreach efforts to coordinate with federal, state, tribal, and local officials and agencies on wildfire preparedness and emergency response plans;\n\n(e) Financially prudent and reasonably practicable methods of line design for new, planned, and existing lines to mitigate fire risk;\n\n(f) Monitoring of forecasted and current weather data for the purpose of assessing and responding to current and anticipated fire risk; and\n\n(g) Developing standards, procedures, and schedules, subject to timely approval of access to rights-of-way, if necessary, for the following actions:\n\n(i) Inspection of the electric corporation’s assets, infrastructure, and facilities within the areas that are identified as heightened fire risk areas in the wildfire mitigation plan, where financially prudent and reasonably practicable;\n\n(ii) De-energization of the electric corporation’s power lines, if considered appropriate by the electric corporation; and\n\n(iii) Vegetation management within the areas that are identified as heightened fire risk areas in the wildfire mitigation plan and are within the electric corporation’s rights-of-way or lands adjacent thereto and that threaten the power lines or other electric corporation infrastructure. If live marketable timber is identified for removal from timber company land adjacent to the rights-of-way, compensation at fair market value shall be made to the landowner for such timber.\n\n(4) Commission-approved wildfire mitigation plans shall be implemented upon approval by the commission and shall be reviewed and updated annually. The plans shall be updated, publicly filed, and approved in accordance with this section and section 61-1804, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) An electric corporation with a commission-approved wildfire mitigation plan shall submit a report to the commission updating the commission on the electric corporation’s compliance with its wildfire mitigation plan on an annual basis or on such other basis as the commission may prescribe by rule or order. The report shall include documentation describing the development and adoption of the wildfire mitigation plan’s components and measures, the wildfire mitigation expenditures, and the work taken to develop and adopt the plan’s components and measures.\n\n[61-1803, added 2025, ch. 249, sec. 1, p. 1103.]",

(1) The commission shall review a wildfire mitigation plan or an update thereto and, after notice and comment, within six (6) months of receiving such filing, shall approve or reject the plan. In reviewing the plan, the commission shall ensure that it meets the minimum requirements stated in section 61-1803, Idaho Code, and shall consider the following factors:\n\n(a) The consistency of the plan with the public health, safety, and welfare;\n\n(b) The feasibility of the plan and the cost of its implementation; and\n\n(c) The degree to which the plan adequately minimizes wildfire risk and proposes to respond to wildfires that do occur.\n\n(2) Within five (5) business days of filing a wildfire mitigation plan with the commission for its review and approval, the electric corporation shall provide notice of the filing to the state forester, cities, counties, fire protection districts, fire protection associations, and timber protection associations within the electric corporation’s Idaho service area. Notice may be given by certified mail or electronic means.\n\n(3) In reviewing a plan, the commission shall consult with the interested entities listed in subsection (2) of this section for technical assistance. With respect to elements of the plan that relate to vegetation management, reduction of wildfire fuels, and other duties of the state forester under title 38, Idaho Code, it shall be presumed that the recommendations of the state forester, if any are provided, are reasonable and appropriate. Such recommendations shall be incorporated in the decision of the commission unless the commission determines they are not just, reasonable, and in the public interest, in which case the commission shall document its reasoning in its order approving or rejecting the plan.\n\n[61-1804, added 2025, ch. 249, sec. 1, p. 1104.]",

(1) In a civil action where wildfire-related damages are being sought against an electric corporation, there is a rebuttable presumption that the electric corporation acted without negligence if, with respect to the cause of the wildfire, the electric corporation reasonably implemented a commission-approved wildfire mitigation plan. This rebuttable presumption extends to any act or omission taken in reasonable accordance with the approved wildfire mitigation plan in effect at the time the fire ignited, regardless of the content in any prior commission-approved plan that is no longer in effect.\n\n(2) If an electric corporation is found liable in a civil action for damages due to any unplanned or uncontrolled fire, then a plaintiff seeking damages in such civil action may recover damages as provided for in sections 38-107(2), 6-1603, and 6-1604, Idaho Code, subject to the limitations provided therein.\n\n[61-1806, added 2025, ch. 249, sec. 1, p. 1105.]",
