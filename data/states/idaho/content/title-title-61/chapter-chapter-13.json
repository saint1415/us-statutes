      "text": "61-1301. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. Title IV of the Americans with disabilities act, public law 101-336, requires that on or before July 26, 1993, telephone corporations providing interstate or intrastate telephone services provide telecommunications relay services (TRS) for individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-impaired that will allow them to engage in telephone communication in a manner functionally equivalent to that of individuals without hearing loss or speech impairments. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the appointment of a TRS administrator who can coordinate TRS services and assist the state in applying for certification of the state TRS program by the federal deadline of October 1, 1992. This certification, if approved by the federal communications commission, will allow every telephone corporation providing intrastate service in Idaho to meet its obligations under federal law by participating in the state telecommunications relay services program.\n\n[61-1301, added 1992, ch. 148, sec. 1, p. 443; am. 2020, ch. 12, sec. 5, p. 25.]",
