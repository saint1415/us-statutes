(1) The provisions of this chapter apply to the construction or modification of transmission facilities located in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the secretary of the United States department of energy under section 1221 of the energy policy act of 2005. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the efficient and timely review of applications for the siting of electric transmission facilities in federally designated national interest electric transmission corridors. The review is intended to facilitate participation from all interested entities and individuals and to avoid federal preemption.\n\n(2) The legislature finds that the efficient and safe transmission of electricity is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of this state, the region and the nation. The legislature further finds that enactment of this chapter is necessary for the protection of the public welfare and public interest.\n\n(3) After the secretary has designated national interest electric transmission corridors in Idaho, no construction or modification of transmission facilities may be undertaken in a national interest electric transmission corridor without first obtaining a route certificate from the commission.\n\n[61-1701, added 2007, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 535.]",
