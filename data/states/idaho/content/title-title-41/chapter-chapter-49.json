      "text": "41-4902. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. (1) The legislature finds that significant quantities of petroleum and petroleum products are being stored in tanks in Idaho to meet the needs of its citizens, foster economic growth and development and the overall quality of life in the state. While most storage tanks are being operated and managed responsibly, there are occasions when releases occur, threatening the public health and safety, and the environment. It is to the benefit of Idaho’s citizens to correct any such threats to the public health and safety or environment as quickly and completely as possible. Significant financial resources must be available to investigate and remedy any release. However, reasonably affordable petroleum liability insurance coverage is unavailable to pay for such corrective and cleanup measures. Thus, creation of a fund for corrective actions for petroleum releases would be beneficial to the state and would provide a method for Idaho petroleum storage tank owners or operators to satisfy the financial responsibility requirements imposed on them by the federal environmental protection agency. Such a fund would be created by the imposition of a \"transfer fee\" of one cent ($.01) per gallon on the delivery or storage of petroleum products within the state of Idaho. Such a fund would provide moneys for the immediate protection of the public health and safety and the environment, while helping avoid catastrophic losses to the owners and operators which could result in negative impacts on Idaho’s economy.\n\n(2) Therefore, it is hereby declared that the intent of the legislature in the passage of this chapter is to create and regulate in the public interest the formation and operation of a liability insurance trust fund that will make contracts of liability insurance available to owners and operators of petroleum storage tanks as defined herein through fair and equitable insurance contracts issued by a state-licensed nonprofit organization meeting reasonable standards as to its administration, reserves, financial soundness and the prompt and fair payment of claims arising out of the legal liability of the public and private entities protected and insured by these contracts, which will also provide for swift corrective action for releases of petroleum or petroleum products from leaking storage tanks. While the release of petroleum from any storage tank in the state may be a threat to public health and safety and the environment, this fund shall only be available for costs incurred as to those tanks which are covered by a contract of insurance between the owner or operator and the trust fund.\n\n[41-4902, added 1990, ch. 119, sec. 1, p. 267; am. 1991, ch. 59, sec. 1, p. 115.]",

This transfer fee is hereby imposed upon the first licensed distributor who receives, as receipt is determined in section 63-2403, Idaho Code, a petroleum product within this state for the privilege of engaging in the delivery or storage of petroleum products whose delivery or storage may present the danger of a discharge into the environment and thus create the liability to be funded. The fee imposed by this subsection shall not apply to: (a) petroleum or petroleum products which are first delivered or stored in this state in a container of fifty-five (55) gallons or less if such container is intended to be transferred to the ultimate consumer of the petroleum or petroleum products; or (b) petroleum or petroleum products delivered or stored in this state for the purpose of packaging or repackaging into containers of fifty-five (55) gallons or less if such container is intended to be transferred to the ultimate consumer of the petroleum or petroleum products.\n\n(8) The transfer fee shall be collected by the commission on all petroleum products delivered or stored within this state after April 1, 1990. This transfer fee shall be in addition to any excise tax imposed on motor fuel or other petroleum products and shall be remitted to the commission with the distributor’s monthly report as required in section 63-2406, Idaho Code. The distributor may deduct from his monthly report those gallons of petroleum products returned to a licensed distributor’s refinery or pipeline terminal storage or exported from the state when supported by proper documents approved by the commission. For the purpose of carrying out its duties under the provisions of this chapter, the commission shall have the powers and duties provided in sections 63-3038, 63-3039, 63-3042 through 63-3066, 63-3068, 63-3071, and 63-3074 through 63-3078, Idaho Code, which sections are incorporated by reference herein as though set out verbatim.\n\n(9) No person shall be excused from liability for any duty or fee imposed in this chapter for failure to obtain a distributor’s license.\n\n(10) The director shall certify to the commission when the unencumbered balance in the trust fund equals thirty-five million dollars ($35,000,000). Effective the first day of the second month following the date of such certification, the imposition of the transfer fee shall be suspended. Thereafter, the director shall certify to the commission when the unencumbered balance in the trust fund equals twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000).
