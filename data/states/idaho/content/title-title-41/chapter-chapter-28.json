Any other corporation organized under chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code, may at any time file a plan of mutualization. Any corporation organized under chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code, may hereafter be referred to in this section as a \"service corporation.\" The director of the department of insurance shall approve any plan of mutualization so filed, and forthwith issue a certificate of authority to the filing corporation to transact insurance in this state pursuant thereto, if:\n\n(a) Except as herein provided and except as consistent with or implicit in the conversion of the service corporation to a mutual insurer, the plan does not deprive existing corporate members of statutory rights expressly set forth in chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code;\n\n(b) The plan has been approved by the corporation’s board of directors;\n\n(c) The corporation satisfies the minimum surplus or deposit requirements of this title for the type or types of mutual insurer to which it will convert, as specified by the corporation in its plan; and\n\n(d) The plan requires the corporation to honor subscribers’ existing contractual rights in their subscriber agreements as if the corporation had not been converted to a mutual insurer. Approval by the service corporation’s board of directors of the plan of mutualization shall be sufficient and effective without the approval or vote of the service corporation’s members, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary or of the service corporation’s bylaws or articles of incorporation. The filing of such a board-approved plan, together with the issuance by the director of the department of insurance of a certificate of authority, shall constitute legal authority, effective from and after the effective date of the plan, specified in the plan, for the corporation to transact insurance in Idaho as a nonprofit mutual insurer pursuant to such plan.\n\n(2) A plan of mutualization shall provide that, from and after its effective date, the corporation’s reserves shall not be used for any purpose or distributed in any manner contrary to this title. A plan of mutualization shall also provide for a \"transition period\" commencing with the plan’s effective date and ending with a date identified as the \"transition period termination date,\" which shall be a date not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of such plan. Prior to the expiration of the transition period, the corporation’s reserves shall not be used for any purpose or distributed in any manner contrary to section 41-3421, Idaho Code. Following conversion, the corporation shall continue to be a nonprofit corporation; provided however, the board of directors of a mutualized service corporation may from time to time declare, apportion, and pay or credit to the corporation’s members dividends pursuant to this title if the corporation’s articles of incorporation (as amended, if applicable, in conjunction with the filing or after the effective date of its plan of mutualization) expressly so provide. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no corporation (including by way of illustration and not limitation, any direct or indirect successor corporation or entity, by merger or acquisition of substantially all its assets) mutualizing under this section shall, in the event of its dissolution, distribute any of its assets except as provided by its articles of incorporation in effect immediately before the effective date of its plan of mutualization; nor shall any such corporation take or fail to take any action that would prevent it from making such distributions at the time of its dissolution.\n\n(3) From and after the transition period termination date, the obligations of participant hospitals, participant physicians, and other licensees under sections 41-3415, 41-3415A, 41-3416 and 41-3431, Idaho Code, and all voting rights held by participant hospitals, participant physicians, and any other participant licensees by virtue of participant status under chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code, shall be extinguished, but until such transition period termination date, they shall retain such voting rights and obligations as they held and for which they were accountable prior to mutualization hereunder, including duties and responsibilities to the corporation and its subscribers. Each policyholder of a policy issued on or after such plan’s effective date shall have all the rights and liabilities of a member of a mutual insurer under the policy, under the corporation’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, and as provided by law. Before such transition period termination date, the corporation shall replace, convert by agreement with subscribers, or allow to lapse pursuant to their express terms all subscriber agreements, so that from and after such transition period termination date the corporation shall have no subscriber agreements in force. From and after the effective date of its plan of mutualization, the corporation shall issue no subscriber agreements, but shall be authorized to accept applications for and to issue insurance policies of the kind or kinds specified by the plan and the corporation is qualified to issue pursuant to law.\n\n(4) The service corporation shall file with the director of the department of insurance, as part of its plan of mutualization, amended bylaws and articles of amendment to articles of incorporation, approved by its board of directors, which articles and bylaws shall conform in all respects with the requirements of this chapter and any applicable rules duly promulgated hereunder, and shall become effective on the effective date of such plan. Approval by the service corporation’s board of directors of such amendments to its articles and bylaws shall be sufficient and effective without the approval or vote of the corporation’s members, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law or of the service corporation’s bylaws or articles of incorporation. Pursuant to the Idaho nonprofit corporation act, the service corporation shall also file with the Idaho secretary of state articles of amendment to its articles of incorporation.\n\n(5) For the period ending on the transition period termination date, the corporation’s plan of mutualization and its articles of incorporation and bylaws may contain provisions the corporation’s board of directors, in the exercise of its discretion and in fulfillment of its duties, deems necessary, convenient or prudent to implement the plan of mutualization, including, but not limited to, transition provisions, expressly identified as such, that allocate voting power among policyholder members, participant licensees and participant hospitals, as applicable and as the board of directors may deem reasonably appropriate; provided however, all transition provisions, whether in the corporation’s articles of incorporation, bylaws or plan of mutualization, shall, without further action or filing, expire upon the transition period termination date.\n\n(6) Within forty-two (42) days of the filing date of a corporation’s plan of mutualization, the director shall approve the same and issue a certificate of authority to the corporation unless the director finds such plan does not comply with subsection (1) of this section, in which case the director shall within such forty-two (42) day period issue a written order disapproving such plan and specifying the reasons therefor. The corporation may preserve the legal effectiveness and effective date of its plan by curing or otherwise responsibly addressing each asserted deficiency identified by the director and filing within fourteen (14) days of the effective date of the director’s order an amended plan of mutualization that reflects corrections and responses made. Within fourteen (14) days of such filing, the director shall issue a certificate of authority or a final order disapproving such amended plan and specifying the reasons therefor, which final order may, within forty-two (42) days after its effective date, be appealed to the district court for Ada county, state of Idaho. Notwithstanding the director’s final order, the corporation shall be legally authorized to transact business pursuant to its plan of mutualization until the forty-second day following the latest of:\n\n(a) The effective date of the director’s final order;\n\n(b) The entry of final judgment by the district court in which review of the director’s final order has been sought; and\n\n(c) The director’s compliance and the district court’s compliance (by entry of a final judgment) with the opinion issued by the last appellate court to which appeal may be taken that has reviewed the district court’s judgment concerning the director’s final order. If the director has prevailed upon final judgment being entered, the corporation’s legal authority to transact business pursuant to its plan of mutualization shall expire at the end of such period; however, if the corporation has prevailed or corrected all deficiencies identified in the director’s final order, the director shall, before or upon the expiration of such period, issue a certificate of authority to the corporation. Issuance of a certificate of authority under this section shall not preclude the director from commencing any proceedings for alleged violations of this title. The procedure in this subsection shall apply to corporations existing under chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code, on December 31, 1993.\n\n(7) Section 41-2805, Idaho Code, and any other provision of this title dealing with newly organized mutual insurers as such, shall have no application to a plan of mutualization under this section or to the corporation adopting or implementing such plan.\n\n(8) If, pursuant to section 41-3406, Idaho Code, a mutualizing service corporation is also operating as a health maintenance organization immediately prior to the effective date of its plan of mutualization, it shall be legally authorized to continue such operations in the manner provided for in said plan after the effective date thereof as if such service corporation had not become a mutual insurer under this section.\n\n(9) From and after the effective date of a plan of mutualization, a corporation mutualizing under this section shall be liable for the tax imposed and provided for in section 41-402, Idaho Code, but only with respect to insurance policies (as opposed to subscriber agreements) issued by it, and subject to refunds, reductions and other adjustments applicable to other domestic mutual insurers. Until all subscriber agreements are terminated, expire or are otherwise converted to policies of insurance issued by the corporation as a mutual insurer, the corporation shall continue to be liable for and pay the tax on subscriber contracts in the manner provided in section 41-3427, Idaho Code, subject to the same exemptions provided in that section, except for premium taxes paid pursuant to this subsection on policies issued as a mutual insurer.\n\n(10) Except as modified in this section and other applicable law, after the effective date of a service corporation’s plan of mutualization, all contracts, rights, powers, privileges, liabilities and obligations of such corporation shall continue unchanged and in effect until repealed, terminated, canceled, amended, waived, satisfied or otherwise legally extinguished.\n\n[41-2854A, added 1994, ch. 78, sec. 1, p. 173; am. 2003, ch. 103, sec. 5, p. 324.]",

No such agreement shall become effective unless filed with the director and approved by him in writing.\n\n(2) The director shall approve such agreement within a reasonable time after filing if he finds it to be fair and equitable to each domestic insurer involved, and that such reinsurance if effectuated would not substantially reduce the protection or service to its policyholders. If the director does not so approve, he shall so notify each insurer involved in writing specifying his reasons therefor.\n\n(3) If for reinsurance of all or substantially all of its business in force, the plan and agreement for such reinsurance must be approved by vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of each domestic mutual insurer’s members voting thereon at meetings of members called for the purpose, pursuant to such reasonable notice and procedure as the director may approve. If a life insurer, right to vote may be limited to members whose policies are other than term or group policies, and have been in effect for more than one (1) year.\n\n(4) If for reinsurance in a stock insurer of all or substantially all of the insurance in force of a mutual insurer, the agreement must provide for payment in cash to each member of the insurer entitled thereto of his equity, if any, in the business reinsured as determined under a fair formula approved by the director, as based upon the reserves, assets (whether or not \"admitted\" assets) and surplus, if any, of the mutual insurer to be taken over by the stock insurer.\n\n(5) No director, officer, agent or employee of any insurer party to such reinsurance, nor any other person, shall receive any fee, commission or other valuable consideration whatsoever for in any manner aiding, promoting, or assisting therein except as set forth in the reinsurance agreement.\n\n[41-2858, added 1961, ch. 330, sec. 626, p. 645.]",
