Prior to advertising, marketing or offering such policy within this state, the association or associations, or the insurer of the association or associations, shall file evidence with the director that the association or associations have at the outset a minimum of one hundred (100) persons and have been organized and maintained in good faith for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance; have been in active existence for at least one (1) year; and have a constitution and bylaws which provide that:\n\n(i) The association or associations hold regular meetings not less than annually to further purposes of the members;\n\n(ii) Except for credit unions, the association or associations collect dues or solicit contributions from members; and\n\n(iii) The members have voting privileges and representation on the governing board and committees.\n\nSixty (60) days after such filing the association or associations will be deemed to satisfy such organizational requirements, unless the director makes a finding that the association or associations do not satisfy those organizational requirements.\n\n(d) A group other than as described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection, subject to a finding by the director that:\n\n(i) The issuance of the group policy is not contrary to the best interest of the public;\n\n(ii) The issuance of the group policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration; and\n\n(iii) The benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged.\n\n(5) \"Long-term care insurance\" means any insurance policy or rider advertised, marketed, offered or designed to provide coverage for not less than twelve (12) consecutive months for each covered person on an expense incurred, indemnity, prepaid or other basis; for one (1) or more necessary or medically necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance or personal care services, provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. Such term includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders which provide directly or which supplement long-term care insurance. Such term also includes a policy or rider which provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. The term shall also include qualified long-term care insurance contracts. Long-term care insurance may be issued by insurers, fraternal benefit societies, managed care organizations, or any similar organization to the extent they are otherwise authorized to issue life or health insurance. Long-term care insurance shall not include any insurance policy which is offered primarily to provide basic medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income or related asset-protection coverage, accident only coverage, specified disease or specified accident coverage, or limited benefit health coverage. With regard to life insurance, this term does not include life insurance policies which accelerate the death benefit specifically for one (1) or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention, or permanent institutional confinement, and which provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and in which neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long-term care. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, any product advertised, marketed or offered as long-term care insurance shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(6) \"Policy\" means, for the purposes of this chapter, any policy, contract, enrolled member agreement, rider or endorsement delivered or issued for delivery in this state by an insurer, fraternal benefit society, managed care organization, or any similar organization.\n\n[41-4603, added 1999, ch. 98, sec. 2, p. 304.]",

Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in subsection (3)(b) of this section expires. No long-term care insurance policy or certificate may exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period described in subsection (3)(b) of this section.\n\n(4) Prior hospitalization/institutionalization:\n\n(a) No long-term care insurance policy may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state if such policy:\n\n(i) Conditions eligibility for any benefits on a prior hospitalization requirement;\n\n(ii) Conditions eligibility for benefits provided in an institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care; or\n\n(iii) Conditions eligibility for any benefits other than waiver of premium, postconfinement, postacute care or recuperative benefits on a prior institutionalization requirement.\n\n(b) (i) A long-term care insurance policy containing postconfinement, postacute care or recuperative benefits shall clearly label in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate entitled \"limitations or conditions on eligibility for benefits\" such limitations or conditions, including any required number of days of confinement.\n\n(ii) A long-term care insurance policy or rider which conditions eligibility for noninstitutional benefits on the prior receipt of institutional care shall not require a prior institutional stay of more than thirty (30) days.\n\n(iii) A long-term care insurance policy or rider containing a benefit advertised, marketed, or offered as a home health care or home care benefit may not condition receipt of benefits on a prior institutionalization requirement.\n\n(5) The director may adopt rules establishing loss ratio standards for long-term care insurance policies provided that a specific reference to long-term care insurance policies is contained in the rule.\n\n(6) Right to return — Free look: Long-term care insurance applicants shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within thirty (30) days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. Long-term care insurance policies and certificates shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page or attached thereto stating in substance that the applicant shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within thirty (30) days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, other than a certificate issued pursuant to a policy issued to a group defined in section 41-4603(4)(a), Idaho Code, the applicant is not satisfied for any reason.\n\n(7) (a) An outline of coverage shall be delivered to a prospective applicant for long-term care insurance at the time of initial solicitation through means which prominently direct the attention of the recipient to the document and its purpose.\n\n(i) The director shall prescribe a standard format, including style, arrangement and overall appearance, and the content of an outline of coverage.\n\n(ii) In the case of agent solicitations, an agent must deliver the outline of coverage prior to the presentation of an application or enrollment form.\n\n(iii) In the case of direct response solicitations, the outline of coverage must be presented in conjunction with any application or enrollment form.\n\n(iv) In the case of a policy issued to a group defined in section 41-4603(4)(a), Idaho Code, an outline of coverage shall not be required to be delivered, provided that the information described in paragraphs (b)(i) through (b)(vi) of this subsection is contained in other materials relating to enrollment. Upon request, these other materials shall be made available to the director.\n\n(b) The outline of coverage shall include:\n\n(i) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;\n\n(ii) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions and limitations contained in the policy;\n\n(iii) A statement of the terms under which the policy or certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including any reservation in the policy of a right to change premium. Continuation or conversion provisions of group coverage shall be specifically described;\n\n(iv) A statement that the outline of coverage is a summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master policy contains governing contractual provisions;\n\n(v) A description of the terms under which the policy or certificate may be returned and premium refunded; and\n\n(vi) A brief description of the relationship of cost of care and benefits.\n\n(8) A certificate issued pursuant to a group long-term care insurance policy which policy is delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall include:\n\n(a) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;\n\n(b) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions and limitations contained in the policy; and\n\n(c) A statement that the group master policy determines governing contractual provisions.\n\n(9) At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary shall be delivered for an individual life insurance policy which provides long-term care benefits within the policy or by rider. In the case of direct response solicitations, the insurer shall deliver the policy summary upon the applicant’s request, but regardless of request shall make such delivery no later than at the time of policy delivery. In addition to complying with all applicable requirements, the summary shall also include:\n\n(a) An explanation of how the long-term care benefit interacts with other components of the policy, including deductions from death benefits;\n\n(b) An illustration of the amount of benefits, the length of benefits, and the guaranteed lifetime benefits if any, for each covered person;\n\n(c) Any exclusions, reductions and limitations on benefits for long-term care;\n\n(d) A statement that any long-term care inflation protection option as defined by the long-term care insurance rule is not available under this policy.\n\n(e) If applicable to the policy type, the summary shall also include:\n\n(i) A disclosure of the effects of exercising other rights under the policy;\n\n(ii) A disclosure of guarantees related to long-term care costs of insurance charges;\n\n(iii) Current and projected maximum lifetime benefits.\n\n(10) Any time a long-term care benefit, funded through a life insurance vehicle by the acceleration of the death benefit, is in benefit payment status, a monthly report shall be provided to the policyholder. Such report shall include:\n\n(a) Any long-term care benefits paid out during the month;\n\n(b) An explanation of any changes in the policy, e.g. death benefits or cash values, due to long-term care benefits being paid out; and\n\n(c) The amount of long-term care benefits existing or remaining.\n\n(11) Any policy or rider advertised, marketed or offered as long-term care or nursing home insurance shall comply with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n[41-4605, added 1999, ch. 98, sec. 2, p. 306.]",
