This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one (1) ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers, provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.\n\n(3) If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to section 41-6305, Idaho Code, shall be the report applicable to that insurer.\n\n(4) An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may apply to the director for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer’s request for a waiver, the director may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, and any other factor the director considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one (1) state, the director shall coordinate with the lead state director or commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer’s request for a waiver.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section:\n\n(a) The director may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests and international supervisor requests.\n\n(b) The director may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report if the insurer has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in section 41-5403, Idaho Code, meets one (1) or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in IDAPA 18.01.66, \"director’s authority for companies deemed to be in hazardous financial condition,\" or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the director.\n\n(6) If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subsection (1) of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium, as reflected in the insurer’s most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one (1) year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this chapter.\n\n[41-6306, added 2017, ch. 75, sec. 1, p. 190.]",
