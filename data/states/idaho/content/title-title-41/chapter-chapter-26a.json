(1) The insurer shall not retain risk as to any one (1) loan, or as to all loans secured by properties in a single housing tract or a contiguous tract, in an amount in excess of ten percent (10%) of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus. In determining the amount of risk retained, applicable reinsurance in an assuming insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state or approved by the director shall be deducted from the total direct risk insured. For the purposes of this section \"contiguous\" means not separated by more than one-half (1/2) of a mile.\n\n(2) The insurer shall not at any time have outstanding aggregate risk liability, net of applicable reinsurance, under mortgage guaranty insurance in amount in excess of twenty-five (25) times its policyholders’ surplus.\n\n(3) The director may waive the requirement of subsection (2) of this section upon a written request of the insurer and finding that the insurer is in compliance with any requirements or conditions imposed by the insurer’s state of domicile and the insurer’s policyholder surplus is reasonable in relationship to the insurer’s aggregate insured risk and adequate to its financial needs.

The insurer shall bear the cost of outside experts retained for the review.\n\n(4) If at any time the insurer’s outstanding risk liability as to mortgage guaranty insurance exceeds the limitations stated in subsection (2) of this section and the insurer has not received a written waiver from the director, the insurer shall accept no new mortgage guaranty insurance risks while such excess exists.\n\n(5) The director may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority of an insurer which violates the provisions of this section.\n\n[41-2653, added 1972, ch. 79, sec. 1, p. 159; am. 2010, ch. 131, sec. 1, p. 280; am. 2015, ch. 127, sec. 1, p. 321.]",
