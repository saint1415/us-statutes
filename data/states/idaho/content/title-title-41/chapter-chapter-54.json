(1) Every domestic insurer shall, on or prior to each March 1 (the \"filing date\"), prepare and submit to the director a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the calendar year just ended, in a form and containing such information as is required by the RBC instructions. In addition, every domestic insurer shall file its RBC report:\n\n(a) With the NAIC in accordance with the RBC instructions; and\n\n(b) With the insurance director in any state in which the insurer is authorized to do business, if the insurance director has notified the insurer of its request in writing, in which case the insurer shall file its RBC report not later than the later of:\n\n(i) Fifteen (15) days from the receipt of notice to file its RBC report with that state; or\n\n(ii) The filing date.\n\n(2) A life and health insurer’s or fraternal benefit society’s RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions.

The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment. An RBC report as so adjusted is referred to as an \"adjusted RBC report.\"\n\n[41-5402, added 1996, ch. 96, sec. 1, p. 284; am. 2014, ch. 319, sec. 2, p. 786.]",
