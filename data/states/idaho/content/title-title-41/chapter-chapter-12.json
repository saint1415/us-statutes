In furtherance of such state interest, the legislature herein provides a method of substituted service of process upon such insurers and declares that in so doing it exercises its power to protect its residents and to define, for the purpose of this statute, what constitutes doing business in this state, and also exercises powers and privileges available to the state by virtue of Public Law 15, 79th Congress of the United States, chapter 20, 1st session, S. 340, which declares that the business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several states.\n\n[41-1205, added 1961, ch. 330, sec. 249, p. 645.]",
