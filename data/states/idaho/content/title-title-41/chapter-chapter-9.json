For purposes of this paragraph, \"insurer\" means a licensed insurance company, hospital or professional service corporation or a managed care organization.\n\n(2) \"Affiliate\" or \"affiliated\" means an entity or person who directly or indirectly through one (1) or more intermediaries controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a specified entity or person.\n\n(3) \"Control,\" including the terms \"controlling,\" \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with,\" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or nonmanagement services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held by the person. Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the voting securities of any other person.
