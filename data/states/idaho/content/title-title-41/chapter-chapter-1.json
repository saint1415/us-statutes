A charitable gift annuity issued before July 1, 1996, is a qualified charitable gift annuity for purposes of this section and the issuance of such a charitable gift annuity does not constitute engaging in the business of insurance in this state.\n\n(3) When entering into an agreement for a qualified charitable gift annuity, the charitable organization shall disclose in writing to the donor, in the annuity agreement, that a qualified charitable gift annuity is not insurance under the laws of this state and is not subject to regulation by the department of insurance or protected by a guaranty association affiliated with the department. The notice provisions of this subsection must be written in a separate paragraph in the annuity agreement in a print size no smaller than that employed in the annuity agreement generally.\n\n(4) A charitable organization that issues qualified charitable gift annuities shall notify the department in writing within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this section, or on the date on which it enters into the organization’s first qualified charitable gift annuity agreement, whichever is later.
