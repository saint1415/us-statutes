(1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe, and determines, after a hearing held under subsection 5 of this section, that any domestic insurer has committed or engaged in, or is about to commit or engage in, any act, practice, or transaction that would subject it to delinquency proceedings under this act, he may make and serve upon the insurer and any other persons involved, such orders as are reasonably necessary to correct, eliminate, or remedy such conduct, condition, or ground.\n\n(2) If upon examination, or at any other time, the director has reasonable cause to believe that any domestic insurer is in such condition as to render the continuance of its business hazardous to the public or to holders of its policies or certificates of insurance, or if such domestic insurer gives its consent, then the director shall, upon his determination:\n\n(a) Notify the insurer of his determination; and\n\n(b) Furnish to the insurer a written list of the director’s requirements to abate his determination.\n\n(3) If the director makes a determination to supervise an insurer subject to an order under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, he shall notify the insurer that it is under the supervision of the director. During the period of supervision, the director may appoint a supervisor to supervise such insurer. The order appointing a supervisor shall direct the supervisor to enforce orders issued under subsections (1) and (2) of this section and may also require that the insurer may not do any of the following things, during the period of supervision, without the prior approval of the director or his supervisor:\n\n(a) Dispose of, convey or encumber any of its assets or its business in force;\n\n(b) Withdraw from any of its bank accounts;\n\n(c) Lend any of its funds;\n\n(d) Invest any of its funds;\n\n(e) Transfer any of its property;\n\n(f) Incur any debt, obligation or liability;\n\n(g) Merge or consolidate with another company; or\n\n(h) Enter into any new reinsurance contract or treaty.\n\n(4) Any insurer subject to an order under the provisions of this section shall comply with the lawful requirements of the director and, if placed under supervision, shall have sixty (60) days from the date the supervision order is served within which to comply with the requirements of the director. In the event of such insurer’s failure to comply within such times, the director may institute proceedings under sections 41-3312 or 41-3317, Idaho Code, to have a rehabilitator or liquidator appointed, or extend the period of supervision.\n\n(5) The notice of hearing under subsection (1) of this section and any order issued pursuant to such subsection shall be served upon the insurer pursuant to the applicable rules of civil or administrative procedure. The notice of hearing shall state the time and place of hearing, and the conduct, condition or ground upon which the director would base his order. Unless mutually agreed between the director and the insurer, the hearing shall occur not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after notice is served and shall be either in Ada county or in some other place convenient to the parties to be designated by the director. The director shall hold all hearings under subsection (1) of this section privately unless the insurer requests a public hearing, in which case the hearing shall be public.\n\n(6) (a) Any insurer subject to an order under subsection (2) of this section may request a hearing to review that order. Such a hearing shall be held as provided in subsection (5) hereof, but the request for a hearing shall not stay the effect of the order.\n\n(b) If the director issues an order under subsection (2) of this section, the insurer may, at any time, waive a director’s hearing and apply for immediate judicial relief by means of any remedy afforded by law without first exhausting administrative remedies. Subsequent to a hearing, any party to the proceedings whose interests are substantially affected shall be entitled to judicial review of any order issued by the director.\n\n(7) During the period of supervision the insurer may request the director to review an action taken or proposed to be taken by the supervisor, specifying wherein the action complained of is believed not to be in the best interest of the insurer.\n\n(8) If any person has violated any supervision order issued under the provisions of this section which, as applied to him was then still in effect, he shall be liable to pay a civil penalty imposed by the district court not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).\n\n(9) The director may apply for and any court of general jurisdiction may grant, such restraining orders, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other orders as may be deemed necessary and proper to enforce a supervision order.\n\n(10) In the event that any person, subject to the provisions of this act, including those persons described in section 41-3306(1), Idaho Code, shall knowingly violate any valid order of the director issued under the provisions of this section and, as a result of such violation, the net worth of the insurer shall be reduced or the insurer shall suffer loss it would not otherwise have suffered, said person shall become personally liable to the insurer for the amount of any such reduction or loss. The director or supervisor is authorized to bring an action on behalf of the insurer in the district court to recover the amount of the reduction or loss together with any costs.\n\n[41-3309, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 509.]",

The court shall vacate the seizure order if the director fails to commence a formal proceeding under this act after having had a reasonable opportunity to do so. An order of the court pursuant to a formal proceeding under this act shall ipso facto vacate the seizure order.\n\n(4) Entry of a seizure order under the provisions of this section shall not constitute an anticipatory breach of any contract of the insurer.\n\n(5) An insurer subject to an ex parte order under the provisions of this section may petition the court at any time after the issuance of such order for a hearing and review of the order. The court shall hold such a hearing and review not more than fifteen (15) days after the request. A hearing under the provisions of this subsection may be held privately in chambers and it shall be so held if the insurer proceeded against so requests.\n\n(6) If, at any time after the issuance of such an order, it appears to the court that any person whose interest is or will be substantially affected by the order did not appear at the hearing and has not been served, the court may order that notice be given. An order that notice be given shall not stay the effect of any order previously issued by the court.\n\n[41-3310, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 510.]",

The director may apply by petition to the district court for an order authorizing him to rehabilitate a domestic insurer or an alien insurer domiciled in this state on any one (1) or more of the following grounds:\n\n(1) The insurer is in such condition that the further transaction of business would be hazardous, financially, to its policyholders, creditors or the public.\n\n(2) There is reasonable cause to believe that there has been embezzlement from the insurer, wrongful sequestration or diversion of the insurer’s assets, forgery or fraud affecting the insurer, or other illegal conduct in, by, or with respect to the insurer that if established would endanger assets in an amount threatening the solvency of the insurer.\n\n(3) The insurer has failed to remove any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, employee, or other person, if the person has been found after notice and hearing by the director to be dishonest or untrustworthy in a way affecting the insurer’s business.\n\n(4) Control of the insurer, whether by stock ownership or otherwise, and whether direct or indirect, is in a person or persons found after notice and hearing to be untrustworthy.\n\n(5) Any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, director or trustee, employee, or other person, has refused to be examined under oath by the director concerning its affairs, whether in this state or elsewhere, and after reasonable notice of the fact the insurer has failed promptly and effectively to terminate the employment and status of the person and all his influence on management.\n\n(6) After demand by the director under the provisions of section 41-223, Idaho Code, under this act, the insurer has failed to promptly make available for examination any of its own property, books, accounts, documents, or other records, or those of any subsidiary or related company within the control of the insurer, or those of any person having executive authority in the insurer so far as they pertain to the insurer.\n\n(7) Without first obtaining the written consent of the director, the insurer has transferred, or attempted to transfer, in a manner contrary to chapter 38, title 41, Idaho Code, or sections 41-2856 and 41-2858, Idaho Code, substantially its entire property or business, or has entered into any transaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or reinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with the property or business of any other person.\n\n(8) The insurer or its property has been or is the subject of an application for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator or sequestrator or similar fiduciary of the insurer or its property otherwise than as authorized under the insurance laws of this state, and such appointment has been made or is imminent, and such appointment might oust the courts of this state of jurisdiction or might prejudice orderly delinquency proceedings under this act.\n\n(9) Within the previous six (6) years the insurer has willfully violated its charter or articles of incorporation, its bylaws, any insurance law of this state, or any valid order of the director under the provisions of section 41-3309, Idaho Code.\n\n(10) The insurer has failed to pay within sixty (60) days after due date any obligation to any state or any subdivision thereof or any judgment entered in any state, if the court in which such judgment was entered had jurisdiction over such subject matter except that such nonpayment shall not be a ground until sixty (60) days after any good faith effort by the insurer to contest the obligation has been terminated, whether it is before the director or in the courts, or the insurer has systematically attempted to compromise or renegotiate previously agreed settlements with its creditors on the ground that it is financially unable to pay its obligations in full.\n\n(11) The insurer has failed to file its annual report or other financial report required by statute within the time allowed by law and, after written demand by the director, has failed to give an adequate explanation immediately.\n\n(12) The board of directors or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or a majority of those individuals entitled to the control of those entities specified in section 41-3802, Idaho Code, request or consent to rehabilitation under this act.\n\n[41-3312, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 511; am. 2013, ch. 266, sec. 12, p. 688.]",

The compensation of the special deputy, counsel, clerks, and assistants and all expenses of taking possession of the insurer and of conducting the proceedings shall be fixed by the director, with the approval of the court and shall be paid out of the funds or assets of the insurer. The persons appointed under this section shall serve at the pleasure of the director. In the event that the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the director may advance the costs so incurred out of any appropriation for the maintenance of the insurance department. Any amounts so advanced for expenses of administration shall be repaid to the director for the use of the insurance department out of the first available money of the insurer.\n\n(2) The rehabilitator may take such action as he deems necessary or appropriate to reform and revitalize the insurer. He shall have all the powers of the directors, officers, and managers, whose authority shall be suspended, except as they are redelegated by the rehabilitator. He shall have full power to direct and manage, to hire and discharge employees subject to any contract rights they may have, and to deal with the property and business of the insurer.\n\n(3) If it appears to the rehabilitator that there has been criminal or tortious conduct, or breach of any contractual or fiduciary obligation detrimental to the insurer by any officer, manager, agent, broker, employee, or other person, he may pursue all appropriate legal remedies on behalf of the insurer.\n\n(4) If the rehabilitator determines that reorganization, consolidation, conversion, reinsurance, merger, or other transformation of the insurer is appropriate, he shall prepare a plan to effect such changes. Upon application of the rehabilitator for approval of the plan, and after such notice and hearings as the court may prescribe, the court may either approve or disapprove the plan proposed, or may modify it and approve it as modified. Any plan approved under the provisions of this section shall be, in the judgment of the court, fair and equitable to all parties concerned. If the plan is approved, the rehabilitator shall carry out the plan. In the case of a life insurer, the plan proposed may include the imposition of liens upon the policies of the company, if all rights of shareholders are first relinquished. A plan for a life insurer may also propose imposition of a moratorium upon loan and cash surrender rights under policies, for such period and to such an extent as may be necessary.\n\n(5) The rehabilitator shall have the power under sections 41-3326 and 41-3327, Idaho Code, to avoid fraudulent transfers.\n\n[41-3314, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 513.]",

Where, by any agreement, a period of limitation is fixed for instituting a suit or proceeding upon any claim, or for filing any claim, proof of claim, proof of loss, demand, notice, or the like, or where in any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, a period of limitation is fixed, either in the proceeding or by applicable law, for taking any action, filing any claim or pleading, or doing any act, and where in any such case the period had not expired at the date of the filing of the petition, the liquidator may, for the benefit of the estate, take any such action or do any such act, required of or permitted to the insurer, within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days subsequent to the entry of an order for liquidation, or within such further period as is shown to the satisfaction of the court not to be unfairly prejudicial to the other party.\n\n(3) No statute of limitations or defense of laches shall run with respect to any action against an insurer between the filing of a petition for liquidation against an insurer and the denial of the petition. Any action against the insurer that might have been commenced when the petition was filed may be commenced for at least sixty (60) days after the petition is denied.\n\n(4) Any guaranty association or foreign guaranty association shall have standing to appear in any court proceeding concerning the liquidation of an insurer if such association is or may become liable to act as a result of the liquidation.\n\n[41-3324, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 520.]",

      "text": "41-3328. VOIDABLE PREFERENCES AND LIENS. (1) (a) A preference is a transfer of any of the property of an insurer to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the insurer within one (1) year before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this act, the effect of which transfer may be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another creditor of the same class would receive. If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then such transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered within one (1) year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation or within two (2) years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.\n\n(b) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:\n\n1. The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;\n\n2. The transfer was made within four (4) months before the filing of the petition;\n\n3. The creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby or his agent acting with reference thereto had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or\n\n4. The creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer whether or not he held such position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five per cent (5%) of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm’s length.\n\n(c) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property, except where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he shall have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.\n\n(2) (a) A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(b) A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(c) A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.\n\n(d) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.\n\n(e) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.\n\n(3) (a) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of such proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.\n\n(b) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, if such consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. Such a lien could not, however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of subsection (2) of this section, through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action or ruling.\n\n(4) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection (2) of this section, to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers’ rights are performed within twenty-one (21) days or any period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\n(5) If any lien deemed voidable under subsection (1)(b) hereof has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety, which has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under this act which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.\n\n(6) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections (1) and (5) of this section shall be discharged from such lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\n(7) The district court shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under the provisions of this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien; and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnified or than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within such reasonable times as the court shall fix.\n\n(8) The liability of a surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying lien nullified and voided by the liquidator, or where the property is retained under subsection (7) of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.\n\n(9) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for the property which becomes a part of the insurer’s estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would otherwise be recoverable from him.\n\n(10) If an insurer shall, directly or indirectly, within four (4) months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this act, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it, pay money or transfer property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate, provided that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate thereof, payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (1)(b)4 of this section.\n\n(11) (a) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference when he has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference. It is permissible to infer that there is reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was made within four (4) months before the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation.\n\n(b) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection (1) of this section shall be personally liable therefor and shall be bound to account to the liquidator.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any person.\n\n[41-3328, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 523.]",

If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within sixty (60) days after mailing of the notice required by section 41-3322, Idaho Code, whichever is later, he is an unexcused late filer.\n\n(3) The liquidator shall make his recommendations to the court under section 41-3342, Idaho Code, for the allowance of an insured’s claim under subsection (2) of this section after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action and the probable costs and expenses of defense. After allowance by the court, the liquidator shall withhold any dividends payable on the claim, pending the outcome of litigation and negotiation with the insured. Whenever it seems appropriate, he shall reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and amend his recommendations to the court. The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendation as in its initial determination. The court may amend its allowance as it thinks appropriate. As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage dividend as was paid on other claims of like property, based on the lesser of:\n\n(a) The amount actually recovered from the insured by action or paid by agreement plus the reasonable costs and expenses of defense; or\n\n(b) The amount allowed on the claims by the court. After all claims are settled or barred, any sum remaining from the amount withheld shall revert to the undistributed assets of the insurer. Delay in final payment under this subsection shall not be a reason for unreasonable delay of final distribution and discharge of the liquidator.\n\n(4) If several claims founded upon one (1) policy are filed, whether by third parties or as claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total equals the policy limit. Claims by the insured shall be evaluated as in subsection (3) of this section. If any insured’s claim is subsequently reduced under subsection (3) of this section, the amount thus freed shall be apportioned ratably among the claims which have been reduced under this subsection.\n\n(5) No claim may be presented under this section if it is or may be covered by any guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.\n\n[41-3338, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 531.]",

If a domiciliary liquidator is appointed in a nonreciprocal state while a liquidation is proceeding under the provisions of this section, the liquidator, under the provisions of this section, may petition the court for permission to act as ancillary receiver under section 41-3353, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) On the same grounds as are specified in subsection (1) of this section, the director may petition any appropriate federal district court to be appointed receiver to liquidate that portion of the insurer’s assets and business over which the court will exercise jurisdiction, or any lesser part thereof that the director deems desirable for the protection of the policyholders and creditors in this state.\n\n(6) The court may order the director, when he has liquidated the assets of a foreign or alien insurer under this section, to pay claims of residents of this state against the insurer under such rules as to the liquidation of insurers under this act as are otherwise compatible with the provisions of this section.\n\n[41-3351, added 1981, ch. 249, sec. 2, p. 536.]",
