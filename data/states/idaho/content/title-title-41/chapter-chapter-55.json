(1) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining reinsurance premium rates to be charged reinsuring carriers to reinsure individuals under this chapter.

In determining the average rate or charges of those health insurance carriers, the rates charged by those carriers shall be actuarially adjusted to determine the rate that would have been charged for benefits similar to those provided by each plan. The standard risk rates shall be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and shall reflect anticipated claims experience, expenses, and other appropriate risk factors for such coverage.\n\n(4) Rates for plan coverage shall not be less than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) nor more than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(5) Carriers shall not issue high risk pool plans as defined in section 41-5501(9), Idaho Code, after April 1, 2017.\n\n[41-5507, added 2000, ch. 472, sec. 17, p. 1638; am. 2005, ch. 353, sec. 6, p. 1119; am. 2017, ch. 281, sec. 6, p. 738.]",

The director may defer all or part of the assessment if the director determines that the payment of the assessment would place the carrier in a financially impaired condition. If all or part of an assessment against a carrier is deferred the amount deferred shall be assessed against the other carriers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessment set forth in this section. The carrier receiving the deferment shall remain liable to the pool for the amount deferred and shall be prohibited from reinsuring any individuals with the pool until such time as it pays the assessments.\n\n[41-5508, added 2000, ch. 472, sec. 17, p. 1639; am. 2017, ch. 281, sec. 7, p. 739.]",
