(1) Every joint public agency self-funded plan issued in this state or providing coverage to any covered family residing within this state, shall contain a provision granting immediate accident and sickness coverage, from and after the moment of birth, to each newborn child or infant of any covered family, including a newborn child placed with the adoptive covered family within sixty (60) days of the adopted child’s date of birth. Coverage under the joint public agency self-funded plan for an adopted newborn child placed with the adoptive covered family more than sixty (60) days after the birth of the adopted child shall be from and after the date the child is so placed. Coverage provided in accordance with this section shall include, but not be limited to, coverage for congenital anomalies. For the purposes of this section, \"child\" means an individual who has not reached eighteen (18) years of age as of the date of the adoption or placement for adoption. For the purposes of this section, \"placed\" shall mean physical placement in the care of the adoptive covered family, or in those circumstances in which such physical placement is prevented due to the medical needs of the child requiring placement in a medical facility, it shall mean when the adoptive covered family signs an agreement for adoption of such child and signs an agreement assuming financial responsibility for such child. Prior to legal finalization of adoption, the coverage required under the provisions of this subsection (1) as to a child placed for adoption with a covered family continues in the same manner as it would with respect to a naturally born child of the covered family until the first to occur of the following events:\n\n(a) The date the child is removed permanently from that placement and the legal obligation terminates; or\n\n(b) The date the covered family rescinds, in writing, the agreement of adoption or agreement assuming financial responsibility.\n\nNo such plan may be issued or amended if it contains any disclaimer, waiver, or other limitation of coverage relative to the coverage or insurability of newborn or adopted children or infants of a covered family covered from and after the moment of birth that is inconsistent with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) An insurer shall not restrict coverage under a joint public agency self-funded plan of any dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the child at the time the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage under the plan.\n\n(3) No joint public agency self-funded plan which provides maternity benefits for a person covered continuously from conception shall be issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state if it contains any exclusion, reduction, or other limitations as to coverage, deductibles, or coinsurance provisions as to involuntary complications of pregnancy, unless such provisions apply generally to all benefits paid under the plan. If a fixed amount is specified in such plan for surgery, the fixed amounts for surgical procedures involving involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be commensurate with other fixed amounts payable for procedures of comparable difficulty and severity. In a case where a fixed amount is payable for maternity benefits, involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be deemed an illness and entitled to benefits otherwise provided by the plan. Where the plan contains a maternity deductible, the maternity deductible shall apply only to expenses resulting from normal delivery and cesarean section delivery; however, expenses for cesarean section delivery in excess of the deductible shall be treated as expenses for any other illness under the plan.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (3), involuntary complications of pregnancy shall include, but not be limited to, puerperal infection, eclampsia, cesarean section delivery, ectopic pregnancy, and toxemia.\n\nAll plans subject to this subsection (3) and issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state shall be construed to be in compliance with this section, and any provision in any such plan which is in conflict with this section shall be of no force or effect.\n\n[41-4123, added 2006, ch. 415, sec. 1, p. 1280.]",
