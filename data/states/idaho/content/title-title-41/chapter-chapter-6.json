director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1979, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such insurer, provided that an insurer may elect a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from that elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1979.\n\n(4b) For any calendar year on or after the effective date of subsection (9)(d) of the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance in the case of life insurance policies issued on or after such effective date, and for any calendar year on or after January 1, 1982, in the case of:\n\n(a) Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued on or after January 1, 1982;\n\n(b) Annuities and pure endowments purchased on or after January 1, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and\n\n(c) The net increase, if any, in any particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts, the company may elect, for the purpose of determining the minimum standard for valuation, for any category of policy or contract, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate as defined in this subsection in lieu of the interest rate specified in subsection (4) or (4a) of this section.\n\nThe provisions of this subsection shall be applicable to:\n\nA. The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of:\n\na. Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) of the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance;\n\nb. Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982;\n\nc. Annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and\n\nd. The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts\n\nshall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this subsection.\n\nB. Calendar year statutory valuation interest rates:\n\na. The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%).\n\n1. For life insurance,\n\nI =.03 + W(R1 -.03) +W/2(R2 -.09);\n\n2. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options,\n\nI =.03 + W (R -.03)\n\nwhere R1 is the lesser of R and.09;\n\nR2 is the greater of R and.09;\n\nR is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection,\n\n3. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in 2. above, the formula for life insurance stated in 1. above shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten (10) years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in 2. above shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten (10) years or less,\n\n4. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in 2. above shall apply,\n\n5. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in 2. above shall apply.\n\nb. However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when subsection (9)(d) of the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance becomes operative.\n\nC. Weighting factors\n\na. The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:\n\n1. Weighting factors for life insurance:\n\nGuaranteeWeightingDurationFactors(Years)10 or less.50More than 10, but not more than 20.45More than 20.35\n\nMore than 10, but not more than 20\n\nMore than 20\n\nFor life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, which are guaranteed in the original policy;\n\n2. Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:\n\n3. Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in 2. above, shall be as specified in tables (i), (ii) and (iii) below, according to the rules and definitions in (iv), (v) and (vi) below:\n\n(i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:\n\nGuaranteeWeighting FactorDurationfor Plan Type(Years)ABC5 or less.80.60.50More than 5, but not morethan 10.75.60.50More than 10, but not morethan 20.65.50.45More than 20.45.35.35Plan Type(ii)ABCFor annuities and guaranteedinterest contracts valued ona change in fund basis, thefactors shown in (i) aboveincreased by:.15.25.05(iii)For annuities and guaranteedinterest contracts valued onan issue year basis (otherthan those with no cashsettlement options) which donot guarantee interest onconsiderations received morethan one (1) year after issueor purchase and for annuitiesand guaranteed interestcontracts valued on a changein fund basis which do notguarantee interest rates onconsiderations received morethan twelve (12) monthsbeyond the valuation date,the factors shown in (i) orderived in (ii) increased by:.05.05.05\n\nWeighting Factor\n\nfor Plan Type\n\nMore than 5, but not more\n\nMore than 10, but not more\n\nMore than 20\n\nFor annuities and guaranteed\n\ninterest contracts valued on\n\na change in fund basis, the\n\nfactors shown in (i) above\n\nincreased by:\n\nFor annuities and guaranteed\n\ninterest contracts valued on\n\nan issue year basis (other\n\nthan those with no cash\n\nsettlement options) which do\n\nnot guarantee interest on\n\nconsiderations received more\n\nthan one (1) year after issue\n\nor purchase and for annuities\n\nand guaranteed interest\n\ncontracts valued on a change\n\nin fund basis which do not\n\nguarantee interest rates on\n\nconsiderations received more\n\nthan twelve (12) months\n\nbeyond the valuation date,\n\nthe factors shown in (i) or\n\nderived in (ii) increased by:\n\n(iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty (20) years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.\n\n(v) Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:\n\nPlan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only:\n\n(1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or\n\n(2) without such adjustment but in installments over five (5) years or more; or\n\n(3) as an immediate life annuity; or\n\n(4) no withdrawal permitted.\n\nPlan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only:\n\n(1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or\n\n(2) without such adjustment but in installments over five (5) years or more; or\n\n(3) no withdrawal permitted.\n\nAt the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five (5) years.\n\nPlan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five (5) years, either:\n\n(1) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or\n\n(2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.\n\n(vi) An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.\n\nD. Reference interest rate\n\na. The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph B. of this subsection shall be defined as follows:\n\n1. For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six (36) months and the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\nb. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\nc. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in b. above, with guarantee duration in excess of ten (10) years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six (36) months and the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\nd. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in b. above, with guarantee duration of ten (10) years or less, the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\ne. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\nf. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in b. above, the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n\nE. Alternative method for determining reference interest rates\n\na. In the event that Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates is no longer published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the NAIC determines that Moody’s corporate bond yield average — monthly average corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the NAIC and approved by regulation promulgated by the director, may be substituted.\n\n(5) Commissioners reserve valuation method.\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (6) and (10) of this section reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of (i) over (ii) as follows:\n\n(i) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen (19) year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one (1) year higher than the age at issue of such policy.\n\n(ii) A net one (1) year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year.\n\nProvided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (10) of this section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (a) the value defined in subparagraph (i) of that paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of such excess first year premium, (b) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (c) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (d) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison the mortality and interest basis stated in subsections (4) and (4b) of this section shall be used.\n\n(b) Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for:\n\n(i) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums,\n\n(ii) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended,\n\n(iii) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts, and\n\n(iv) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts,\n\nshall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of subsection (5)(a) of this section, except that any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards shall be disregarded in the determination of modified net premiums.\n\n(6) Individual annuity and pure endowment reserves.\n\n(a) This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.\n\n(b) Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.\n\n(7) Minimum aggregate reserves. In no event shall an insurer’s aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after the operative date of section 41-1927, Idaho Code, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (5), (6), (10) and (11) of this section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.\n\n(8) Optional reserve basis.\n\n(a) Reserves for policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of section 41-1927, Idaho Code, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to such date.\n\n(b) For any category of policies, contracts or benefits specified in subsections (4), (4a) and (4b) of this section, issued on or after the operative date of section 41-1927, Idaho Code, (the standard nonforfeiture law), reserves may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standard or standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policies or contracts.\n\n(9) Lower valuations. An insurer which at any time had adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided under this section may, with the approval of the director, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided under this section.\n\n(10) Minimum reserve. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurer on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon, but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections (4) and (4b) of this section.\n\nProvided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subsection (5) of this section, ignoring the second paragraph of subsection (5) of this section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (5) of this section, including the second paragraph of that subsection, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(11) In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on the then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (5), (6) and (10) of this section, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:\n\n(a) Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan, and\n\n(b) Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this standard valuation law,\n\nas determined by rules promulgated by the director.\n\n(12) Actuarial opinion of reserves.\n\n(a) Actuarial opinion prior to the operative date of the valuation manual.\n\n(i) Every life insurance company doing business in this state shall annually submit the opinion of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts specified by the director by rule are computed appropriately, are based on assumptions which satisfy contractual provisions, are consistent with prior reported amounts and comply with applicable laws of this state. The director by rule shall define the specifics of this opinion and add any other items deemed to be necessary to its scope.\n\n(ii) Actuarial analysis of reserves and assets supporting such reserves.\n\n1. Every life insurance company, except as exempted by or pursuant to rule, shall also annually include in the opinion required by subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph, an opinion of the same qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts specified by the director by rule, when considered in light of the assets held by the company with respect to the reserves and related actuarial items, including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on the assets and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under the policies and contracts, make adequate provision for the company’s obligations under the policies and contracts including, but not limited to, the benefits under and expenses associated with the policies and contracts.\n\n2. The director may provide by rule for a transition period for establishing any higher reserves which the qualified actuary may deem necessary in order to render the opinion required in this subsection.\n\n(iii) Requirements for opinion in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. Each opinion required in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be governed by the following provisions:\n\n1. A memorandum, in form and substance acceptable to the director as specified by rule, shall be prepared to support each actuarial opinion.\n\n2. If the insurance company fails to provide a supporting memorandum at the request of the director within a period specified by rule or the director determines that the supporting memorandum provided by the insurance company fails to meet the standards prescribed by the rules or otherwise unacceptable to the director, the director may engage a qualified actuary at the expense of the company to review the opinion and prepare such supporting memorandum as is required by the director.\n\n(iv) Requirements for all opinions subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection. Every opinion subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be governed by the following provisions:\n\n1. The opinion shall be submitted with the annual statement reflecting the valuation of such reserve liabilities for each year ending on or after December 31, 1995.\n\n2. The opinion shall apply to all business in force including individual and group health insurance plans, in form and substance acceptable to the director as specified by rule.\n\n3. The opinion shall be based on standards adopted from time to time by the actuarial standards board and on such additional standards as the director may by rule prescribe.\n\n4. In the case of an opinion required to be submitted by a foreign or alien company, the director may accept the opinion filed by that company with the insurance supervisory official of another state if the director determines that the opinion reasonably meets the requirements applicable to a company domiciled in this state.\n\n5.
