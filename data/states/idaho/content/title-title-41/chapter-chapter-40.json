Is funded, at minimum on a monthly basis, at an amount equal to at least one hundred percent (100%) of the self-funded plan’s liability, less any surplus as defined in section 41-4002, Idaho Code, from previous years.\n\nThe director may also waive any or all requirements provided in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, provided that the plan maintains reserves and surplus, as defined in section 41-4002, Idaho Code, of at least the amount certified annually by a qualified actuary as sufficient without aggregate coverage.\n\n(4) A surplus note that has been approved by the director in a form and as defined in section 41-2841, Idaho Code, may be used to fund surplus and shall not be accounted as a liability.\n\n(5) Up to one-third (1/3) of the surplus required by this section may be funded by a clean, irrevocable letter of credit, in a form acceptable to the director, issued in favor of the trust fund by a federally or state-chartered bank having a branch office in Idaho. Such irrevocable letter of credit cannot be guaranteed by pledge of any of the plan assets. The funding cannot be in the form of prepaid contributions or other loan or associated with an offsetting liability.\n\n(6) A newly formed plan with no prior operating history shall meet the minimum surplus requirements no later than twelve (12) months after the date of initial operation. The director may extend for a reasonable period not to exceed twelve (12) additional months, provided that the plan is meeting all other provisions of this chapter.

For the purposes of this section, \"child\" means an individual who has not reached eighteen (18) years of age as of the date of the adoption or placement for adoption. For the purposes of this section, \"placed\" shall mean physical placement in the care of the adoptive covered family, or in those circumstances in which such physical placement is prevented due to the medical needs of the child requiring placement in a medical facility, it shall mean when the adoptive covered family signs an agreement for adoption of such child and signs an agreement assuming financial responsibility for such child. Prior to legal finalization of adoption, the coverage required under the provisions of this subsection as to a child placed for adoption with a covered family continues in the same manner as it would with respect to a naturally born child of the covered family until the first to occur of the following events:\n\n(a) The date the child is removed permanently from that placement and the legal obligation terminates; or\n\n(b) The date the covered family rescinds, in writing, the agreement of adoption or agreement assuming financial responsibility.\n\nNo such plan may be issued or amended if it contains any disclaimer, waiver, or other limitation of coverage relative to the coverage or insurability of newborn or adopted children or infants of a covered family, which child or children are covered from and after the moment of birth that is inconsistent with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) Neither the plan trustee or employer or a postsecondary educational institution nor an insurer shall restrict coverage under a self-funded plan of any dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the child at the time the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage under the plan.\n\n(3) No self-funded plan which provides maternity benefits for a person covered continuously from conception shall be issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 1977, if it contains any exclusion, reduction, or other limitations as to coverage, deductibles, or coinsurance provisions as to involuntary complications of pregnancy, unless such provisions apply generally to all benefits paid under the plan. If a fixed amount is specified in such plan for surgery, the fixed amounts for surgical procedures involving involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be commensurate with other fixed amounts payable for procedures of comparable difficulty and severity. In a case where a fixed amount is payable for maternity benefits, involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be deemed an illness and entitled to benefits otherwise provided by the plan. Where the plan contains a maternity deductible, the maternity deductible shall apply only to expenses resulting from normal delivery and cesarean section delivery; however, expenses for cesarean section delivery in excess of the deductible shall be treated as expenses for any other illness under the plan. This subsection shall apply to all self-funded plans except any such plan made subject to an applicable collective-bargaining agreement in effect before January 1, 1977.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, involuntary complications of pregnancy shall include, but not be limited to, puerperal infection, eclampsia, cesarean section delivery, ectopic pregnancy, and toxemia.\n\nAll plans subject to this subsection and issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 1977, shall be construed to be in compliance with this section, and any provision in any such plan which is in conflict with this section shall be of no force or effect.\n\n(4) From and after January 1, 1998, no self-funded plan that provides maternity benefits shall restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child in a manner that would be in conflict with the newborns’ and mothers’ health protection act of 1996.\n\n(5) Any new or renewing self-funded group disability plan or blanket disability plan delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall provide that an unmarried child under the age of twenty-six (26) years shall be permitted to remain on the parent’s or parents’ plan. Further, any unmarried child of any age who is medically certified as disabled and financially dependent upon the parent is permitted to remain on the parent’s or parents’ plan.\n\n[41-4023, added 1976, ch. 113, sec. 5, p. 448; am. 1993, ch. 305, sec. 5, p. 1134; am. 1994, ch. 365, sec. 10, p. 1165; am. 2006, ch. 414, sec. 20, p. 1269; am. 2008, ch. 296, sec. 4, p. 828; am. 2009, ch. 125, sec. 6, p. 396; am. 2013, ch. 181, sec. 22, p. 433.]",

(1) From and after July 1, 1990, no self-funded plan shall be issued in Idaho which excludes from coverage services rendered the subscriber while a resident in an Idaho state institution, provided the services to the subscriber would be covered by the contract if rendered to him outside an Idaho state institution.\n\n(2) From and after July 1, 1990, no self-funded plan may contain any provision denying or reducing benefits otherwise provided under the policy for the reason that the person insured is receiving health or mental health care or developmental services provided by the department of health and welfare, whether or not the department of health and welfare bases its charges for such services on the recipient’s ability to pay. Provided, nothing in this section shall prevent the issuance of a contract which excludes or reduces benefits where the charge level or amount of the charge levied by a governmental entity for such services would vary or be affected in any way by the existence of coverage under a self-funded plan.\n\n[41-4024, added 1990, ch. 300, sec. 5, p. 830.]",

Such coverage shall include at least the following benefits:\n\n(a) One (1) baseline mammogram for any woman who is thirty-five (35) through thirty-nine (39) years of age.\n\n(b) A mammogram every two (2) years for any woman who is forty (40) through forty-nine (49) years of age, or more frequently if recommended by the woman’s physician.\n\n(c) A mammogram every year for any woman who is fifty (50) years of age or older.\n\n(d) A mammogram for any woman desiring a mammogram for medical cause.\n\nSuch coverage shall not exceed the cost of the examination.\n\n(2) As used in this section, \"mastectomy\" means the removal of all or part of the breast for medically necessary reasons as determined by a licensed physician.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall apply to specified accident, specified disease, hospital indemnity, medicare supplement, long-term care or other limited benefit health insurance policies.\n\n[41-4025, added 1992, ch. 132, sec. 5, p. 415; am. 1993, ch. 113, sec. 5, p. 290.]",
