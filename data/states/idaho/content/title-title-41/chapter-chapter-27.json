Rates for each classification may, at the discretion of the title insurer, or the title insurance rating organization filing the rate, be less than the cost of the expense elements in the case of smaller insurances, and the excess may be charged against larger insurances without rendering the rate unfairly discriminatory.\n\n(4) When the director finds upon application by a title insurer that any rate for a particular kind or class of risk cannot practicably be filed before it is used, or any contract or kind of title insurance, by reason of rarity or peculiar circumstances, does not lend itself to advance determination and filing of rates, he may, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, permit such rate or contract or kind of title insurance to be used without a previous notice and thirty (30) day waiting period.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-2706, as added by 1973, ch. 135, sec. 3, p. 252; am. 2011, ch. 195, sec. 2, p. 557.]",

No title insurer doing business in this state shall guarantee the payment of deeds of trust or mortgages on real property. Nor shall any title insurer intentionally issue a title insurance policy without showing any outstanding enforceable recorded liens and encumbrances which are of record against the real property, except under circumstances the director of the department of insurance under his rulemaking powers may approve.

A title insurer shall not allow or permit any person, firm, association or corporation to act as its agent in relation to the issuance of any certificate, title insurance policy, or other underwriting contract unless such person, firm, association or corporation shall first have obtained a title insurance agent’s license for each county for which policies are to be written from the director of the department of insurance. No person, firm, association or corporation shall act within this state as such agent for any title insurer without first having obtained a license from the director of insurance and filed a bond or cash deposit in lieu thereof as required herein.\n\n(2) A separate agent’s license for each county shall be issued by the director of the department of insurance upon due showing filed by the applicant upon forms to be provided by the director of the department of insurance and payment of a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), upon oath, that such applicant if an individual, is a bona fide resident of Idaho, if a firm or association is composed wholly of Idaho residents, or if a corporation is duly authorized or qualified to do business in the state, that the individual agent (or if a corporation or association, its managerial personnel who are going to exercise the license privilege) has reasonable experience or instruction in the field of title examinations and title insurance and the insurance laws of Idaho, that the applicant owns or leases, separately or with another, and maintains an adequate, complete set of tract indexes and abstract records of each county wherein he proposed to do business, and such application shall be endorsed by the title insurer with whom he proposed to do business that the proposed agent is known to have a good reputation and is worthy of public trust and that such title insurer knows of no fact or condition that would disqualify the agent from receiving the permit. An agent’s license shall continue from the date issued until the first day of January of each year and shall be automatically renewed thereon upon the payment of the annual fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) by the agent, unless terminated as herein provided by the director of the department of insurance for cause. If the filing fee is not promptly paid, the applicant shall be subject to a late filing fee of two dollars ($2.00) a day up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100).\n\n(3) Upon the termination of any agency by a title insurer or by the agent terminating, the title insurer shall immediately notify the director of the department of insurance in writing and a title insurance agent shall forthwith notify the director of the department of insurance of the name of a new title insurer with whom he proposes to do business, with the new title insurer’s endorsement upon said notification. No title insurer shall allow the license of an agent for which it has vouched to continue unless all of the foregoing conditions have been complied with.\n\n(4) The license of any title insurance agent may be denied, or the license suspended, revoked or renewal thereof refused, by the director of the department of insurance after notice and hearing if he finds that such license holder has:\n\n(a) Willfully violated any provisions of title 41, Idaho Code, or the rules issued thereunder;\n\n(b) Has intentionally made a material misstatement in the application for such license;\n\n(c) Has obtained or attempted to obtain such license by fraud or misrepresentation;\n\n(d) Has misappropriated or converted to his own use or illegally withheld money belonging to a title insurance company, an insured or any other person;\n\n(e) Has demonstrated his lack of trustworthiness or competence to act as such agent or been guilty of fraudulent or dishonest practices;\n\n(f) Has materially misrepresented the terms and conditions of a title insurance policy or contract, or the condition of the title represented thereby; or\n\n(g) Has failed to maintain a separate and distinct accounting of escrowed funds and has failed to maintain an escrow bank account or account separate and apart from all other accounts.\n\n(5) Before any license is denied, suspended or revoked or renewal refused, the director shall give thirty (30) days’ written notice by registered mail to the licensee or applicant and the title insurer represented by the agent, and if said agent or title insurer desires, to set a date of hearing and to allow the production of evidence by said parties or any other interested person as to the matter. The right and remedies of the parties shall be as set forth in chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. Any decision of the director of the department of insurance shall be made in writing and filed in his office and mailed to the title insurer and agent involved.\n\n(6) As a condition of obtaining said license, the individual to be licensed for himself or the entity to be licensed for each employee escrow officer shall obtain, file and pay for a surety bond as provided for an escrow officer.\n\n(7) Regular examination of the tract indexes, abstract records, and any other records to ascertain compliance with title 41, Idaho Code, and related rules, of a title agent after the first examination thereof by the director shall be limited to not more than every fifth year, unless the agent otherwise requests or the director has cause to believe the same does not comply with this chapter or the rules thereunder. The director shall prepare an examination report following each examination and shall provide such report to the title agent being examined affording the person up to twenty-eight (28) days within which to review, comment and request a hearing. Unless a hearing is requested in accordance with chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code, the examination report shall be deemed available to the public notwithstanding the exemptions from disclosure provided in chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code. In addition, if the title agency affirmatively requests, any reply to the examination report shall be deemed available to the public notwithstanding the exemptions from disclosure provided in chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code.

An escrow officer is an officer or an employee of a title insurance agent whose duties include any of the following: handling escrows, settlements, closings, and funds related thereto, except there are not to be included employees whose duties are wholly clerical or to act only as cosigners of escrow drafts. Each title insurance agent holding a license under this chapter, shall file with the director of insurance on or before January 1, of each year, and amend the same for new escrow officers employed within thirty (30) days of such employment, upon forms furnished by the director of insurance, the name and address of each person employed by it to serve in the capacity of an escrow officer. No title insurance agent shall permit any person to act as an escrow officer within this state beyond the time for compliance with the foregoing conditions.

The bond shall be in the minimum amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per county in which the title insurance agent is licensed and increased in increments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) corresponding to each additional person employed as an escrow officer in the county, provided that the maximum bond required of any title insurance agent shall be fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) irrespective of the number of counties in which the agent is licensed or the number of escrow officers employed and provided that the manager or supervisor of the title insurance agent’s principal office in a county shall not be counted as an escrow officer in determining the amount of the title insurance agent’s bond. The bond shall run to the director of insurance and the condition of the bond shall be that the title insurance agent shall pay damages which may be sustained by the public in the conduct of title insurance related business as defined in section 41-2704(3), Idaho Code, by reason of the title insurance agent’s failure to comply with the provisions of this act and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto by the director of insurance which shall include damages sustained by reason of fraud, dishonesty, forgery, theft or wilful misapplication of funds committed by the title insurance agent and its employees. Such bond(s) may be by blanket form coverage. In lieu of such bond, cash or securities approved by the director in like amount may be deposited through the director of insurance under custodial arrangement as provided for deposits by insurers under section 41-804, Idaho Code. The cash or securities so deposited shall be subject to the same condition as the bond.\n\nIf at any time it appears to the director that the terms of such bond may have been violated, the director may require the agent to appear in Boise with such records as he deems proper on the date not earlier than ten (10) days and not later than twenty-five (25) days after service of such notice, and there conduct an examination into the matter. If, upon examination the director is satisfied that the terms of the bond have been violated, he shall forthwith notify the surety and prepare a written statement covering the facts and deliver it to the attorney general of Idaho, with copy to the surety, whose duty it shall be to investigate the charges, and if satisfied that the terms of the bond have been violated, then to enforce the liability against the cash or securities, or by suit on said bond in Ada County in the name of the director of the department of insurance for the benefit of all parties who have suffered any loss because of the breach of the terms of said bond or deposit.\n\nThe provisions of this section as to escrow officers and the requirement for filing escrow fee rates with the director shall also be applicable to any corporation twenty-five per cent (25%) or more of the capital stock or ownership of which is directly or indirectly owned by a title insurer or title insurance agent, or any person or entity directly or indirectly owning a majority of the stock or ownership of such insurer or agent.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-2711, as added by 1973, ch. 135, sec. 8, p. 252; am. 1975, ch. 209, sec. 1, p. 580.]",

      "text": "41-2712. TITLE INSURANCE RATING ORGANIZATION. (1) Finding. There are at the present time more than twelve (12) title insurers to which this chapter applies. Reasonable competition exists among said insurers with respect to classes of insurance written on titles. Said title insurers are not members of or subscribers to any rating organization with respect to their operation in Idaho. Some of said insurers presumably would become members of or subscribers to a rating organization if the same existed in relation to title insurance in this state. It is reasonable to assume that competition will continue to exist among the title insurers if ratemaking in concert were authorized and rating organizations were licensed in this state for such insurance. So long as reasonable competition continues in title insurance, the public welfare is served both by the making of rates in concert and by the making of rates by individual insurers, and no review thereof by the state is necessary or desirable in the public interest with respect to such class of insurance. So long as such competition continues, regulation adequate to protect the welfare of the citizens of the state with respect to such ratemaking in concert and such rating organization may be secured by licensing and periodic examination of the rating organization.\n\n(2) Declaration of Policy. It is the purpose of this section to regulate title insurance within the scope hereby by allowing a title insurer or title insurance agent by becoming a member of a licensed title insurance rating organization making a filing under this chapter to satisfy its obligations for such filings; to authorize ratemaking in concert and the operation of the rating organization subject to regulations provided in this chapter; to retain and preserve the benefits flowing from reasonable competition; and to provide a review of such rates by the state for such classes of insurance within the scope of this chapter, if any, in which such reasonable competition may not hereafter exist.\n\n(3) Rating Organization. A rating organization as defined, established and regulated in sections 41-1415 and 41-1416, Idaho Code, may be established for the title insurance business. The same may be licensed and commence business as therein provided upon hearing and findings by the director of the department of insurance in accordance herewith. Filings may be made thereby by a rating organization consisting of six (6) or more title insurers receiving over fifty per cent (50%) of the title insurance premiums on business in the state pursuant to sections 41-2706 and 41-2707, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) After hearing upon thirty (30) days to the rating organization and its members and upon a finding by the director that reasonable competition no longer exists with respect to any or all of the classes of title insurance, and upon ninety (90) days’ expiration after notice thereof, and for so long thereafter as such finding with respect thereto continues in effect, such rating organization may not make filings herein authorized as to such class or classes of title insurance.\n\n(5) A rating organization subject to rules and regulations approved by the director shall admit any title insurer applying thereto as a member or as a subscriber to its rating service at reasonable cost and without discrimination or to withdraw therefrom. The cooperation of title insurance rating organizations and the cooperation of the rating organization and title insurer, and the concert action by title insurers under this general management control of the rating organization in ratemaking and other matters within the scope of title 41, Idaho Code, is hereby authorized, providing the premium rates for basic classification of policies, escrow fee rates, division of premium with agents and contracts are filed and approved in accordance with sections 41-2706 and 41-2707, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) Deviations. Every member of or subscriber to a title insurance rating organization shall adhere to the filings made on its behalf by such organization, except that any title insurer member or subscriber may file with the director a decrease or increase to be applied to any and all elements of the rates produced by the rating system so filed for the class of title insurance upon a finding by the director that it is a proper rating unit for the application of such decrease or increase or proper to be applied to the rates for a particular area. Such deviation filing shall specify the basis for the modification and be accompanied by statistical or historical pattern justification. A copy of said filing shall be filed with the rating organization. Such deviation filing shall be subject to the provisions of sections 41-2706 and 41-2707, Idaho Code. Deviations shall be effective for one (1) year unless terminated sooner by order of the director.\n\n(7) Appeals by the Minority. Any member of or subscriber to the rating organization may appeal to the director from any action or decision of the rating organization and the director shall, after hearing held upon not less than fifteen (15) days’ written notice to the applicant and the rating organization, issue an order approving the rating organization’s action or directing it to give further consideration thereto, all within thirty (30) days following such order. On the appeal from the decision or action of the rating organization the director may, in the event he finds such decision or action was unreasonable, issue an order directing said rating organization to make additions to its filings on behalf of its members or subscribers, including approval of the filing suggested by the appellant, if either be in accordance herewith. Failure of a rating organization to take action or make a decision within sixty (60) days after submission of a proposal for deviation shall constitute a rejection thereof.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-2712, as added by 1973, ch. 135, sec. 9, p. 252.]",

In the exercise of the powers of the director of the department of insurance to supervise and regulate title insurers, title insurance agents and title insurance rating organizations as provided in this chapter, as well as the powers of examination set forth in sections 41-219 and 41-220, Idaho Code, each title insurer, title insurance agent or rating organization regulated or examined shall, at the direction of the director, pay directly to such person charged with enforcing the law or regulations and making the examinations, actual travel expenses, a reasonable expense allowance, and compensation, at reasonable rates as approved by the director of the department of insurance, necessarily incurred in such matters on the presentation of a detailed account of such charges and expenses. A title insurer shall be charged for the original examination of a title insurance agent which the insurer desires to represent it, and a title insurer or rating organization shall be charged directly for hearings upon any hearing originated by filings made by it. The regulation and examination direct charges herein provided may include both field work and work in the office of the director necessary thereto.\n\nSeparately from the direct charges herein provided, the director may levy a general charge upon each title insurer in proportion to the gross premiums from title insurance written by it to defray the costs of regulation required by this chapter. Provided, nevertheless, a title insurer shall not be charged in any one (1) year, separately from the direct charges for examination under section 41-219, Idaho Code, said plant examination and said hearings, in excess of one per cent (1%) of the gross premiums as defined in section 41-402, Idaho Code, for title insurance written on Idaho real property in said year, provided the director in the first year after the effective date hereof may charge not in excess of two per cent (2%) of the gross premiums and may levy said charge after July 1, 1973, in advance based on the prior year’s premiums. The director from year to year may carry forward any unexpended balance of general charges made in a rotating fund for said expenses to be incurred thereafter.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-2713, as added by 1973, ch. 135, sec. 10, p. 252.]",

(1) A title insurer may issue closing or settlement protection to a buyer, borrower or lender that is a party to a transaction in which a title insurance policy will be issued. The closing or settlement protection shall be on a form filed with the department in accordance with section 41-2705, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) The closing or settlement protection shall be limited to indemnifying the buyer, borrower or lender insured against a loss due to either or both of the following actions of a licensed and authorized title insurance agent and is deemed for the purpose of this section to be within the business of title insurance as set forth in section 41-2704, Idaho Code:\n\n(a) Theft or misappropriation of closing or settlement funds in connection with a transaction in which a title insurance policy or title insurance policies will be issued by or on behalf of the title insurer issuing the closing or settlement protection.\n\n(b) Failure to comply with the written closing instructions when agreed to by the title agent or title insurer, but only to the extent that the failure to follow the instructions relates to the status of the title to that interest in land or the validity, enforceability and priority of the lien of the mortgage on that interest in land.\n\n(3) A rate must be charged and the rate charged by a title insurer for each transaction that includes closing protection coverage shall not be subject to any agreement requiring a division of rates or premiums collected on behalf of the title insurer. The issuance of a closing or settlement protection to a buyer, borrower or lender that is a party to a transaction in which a title insurance policy will be issued shall be considered to be one (1) transaction for which a single rate is charged and shall not result in a separate charge to each party. The rate shall:\n\n(a) Be filed with the department in accordance with sections 41-2706 and 41-2707, Idaho Code;\n\n(b) Be the only rate charged for closing protection; and\n\n(c) Not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00).\n\n(4) A title insurer may not provide any other protection that purports to indemnify against improper acts or omissions of a person with regard to closing or settlement services.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided for in closing or settlement protection, a buyer, borrower, lender, or title insurer retains all their respective rights and remedies in connection with losses suffered due to theft or misappropriation of closing or settlement funds or the failure to comply with written closing instructions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a buyer, borrower or lender to obtain closing or settlement protection. A failure to obtain closing or settlement protection shall not be construed as an error, omission or other breach of duty of a buyer, borrower or lender.\n\n[41-2714, added 2015, ch. 275, sec. 3, p. 1133.]",
