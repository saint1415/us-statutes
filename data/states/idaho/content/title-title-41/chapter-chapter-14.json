(1) As to all rates which are subject to this chapter, due consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state, to the conflagration and catastrophe hazards, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policy holders, members or subscribers, to past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this state, and to all other relevant factors, including judgment factors, within and outside this state; and in the case of fire insurance rates, consideration shall be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during a period of not less than the most recent five (5) year period for which such experience is available.\n\n(2) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by an insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expense provisions are applicable.\n\n(3) Risks may be grouped by classification for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. Such standards may measure any difference among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. Such classifications and modifications shall apply to all risks under the same or substantially the same circumstances or conditions.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-1437, as added by 1969, ch. 306, sec. 14, p. 917.]",

(1) Every insurer, rating organization or advisory organization and every group, association or other organization of insurers which engages in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance shall maintain reasonable records, of the type and kind reasonably adapted to its method of operation, of its experience or the experience of its members and of the data, statistics or information collected or used by it in connection with the rates, rating plans, rating systems, underwriting rules, policy or bond forms, surveys or inspections made or used by it, so that such records will be available at all reasonable times to enable the director to determine whether such organization, insurer, group or association, and, in the case of an insurer or rating organization, every rate, rating plan and rating system made or used by it, complies with the provisions of this chapter applicable to it. The maintenance of such records in the office of a licensed rating organization of which an insurer is a member or subscriber will be sufficient compliance with this section for any such insurer maintaining membership or subscribership in such organization, to the extent that the insurer uses the rates, rating plans, rating systems or underwriting rules of such organization. Such records shall be maintained in an office within this state or shall be made available for examination or inspection within this state by the director at any time upon reasonable notice.\n\n(2) In addition to or in lieu of any other penalty therefor, for each failure to maintain the records as required hereunder the director may impose upon the person so failing the penalty prescribed by section 41-1432.\n\n[I.C., sec. 41-1439, as added by 1969, ch. 306, sec. 16, p. 917.]",

(1) Any person aggrieved by any rate charged, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule followed or adopted by an insurer or rating organization may himself or by his authorized representative make written request of the insurer or rating organization to review the manner in which the rate, plan, system, or rule has been applied with respect to insurance afforded him. If the request is not granted within thirty (30) days after it is made, the requestor may treat it as rejected. Any person aggrieved by the refusal of an insurer or rating organization to grant the review requested, or by the failure or refusal to grant all or part of the relief requested, may file a written complaint and request for hearing with the director, specifying the grounds relied upon. If the director has already disposed of the issue as raised by a similar complaint, he may deny the hearing. If the director believes that probable cause for the complaint does not exist or that the complaint is not made in good faith, he shall deny the hearing. Otherwise, and if he also finds that the complaint charges a violation of this chapter and that the complainant would be aggrieved if the violation is proven, he shall proceed as provided in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(2) If after examination of an insurer, rating organization, advisory organization, or group, association or other organization of insurers which engages in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance, or upon the basis of other information, or upon sufficient complaint as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the director has good cause to believe that such insurer, organization, group or association, or any rate, rating plan or rating system made or used by any such insurer or rating organization, does not comply with the requirements and standards of this chapter applicable to it, he shall, unless he has good cause to believe such noncompliance is willful, give notice in writing to such insurer, organization, group or association stating therein in what manner and to what extent noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying therein a reasonable time, not less than ten (10) days thereafter, in which the noncompliance may be corrected. Notices under this section shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, unless a hearing is held under subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(3) If the director has good cause to believe that such noncompliance is willful, or if within the period prescribed by the director in the notice required by subsection (2) of this section, the insurer, organization, group or association does not make such changes as may be necessary to correct the noncompliance specified by the director or establish to the satisfaction of the director that such specified noncompliance does not exist, then the director may hold a public hearing in connection therewith in accordance with chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code. If no notice has been given as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the notice shall state in what manner and to what extent noncompliance is alleged to exist. The hearing shall not consider any subject not specified in the notice required by subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(4) If after a hearing pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the director finds:\n\n(a) That any rate, rating plan or rating system violates the applicable provisions of this chapter, he may issue an order to the insurer, or rating organization, group or association which has been the subject of the hearing specifying in what respects such violation exists and requiring compliance within a reasonable time thereafter.\n\n(b) That an insurer, rating organization, advisory organization, or a group, association or other organization of insurers which engages in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance, is in violation of the applicable provisions of this chapter other than the provisions dealing with rates, rating plans or rating systems, he may issue an order to such insurer, organization, group or association which has been the subject of the hearing specifying in what respects such violation exists and requiring compliance within a reasonable time thereafter.\n\n(c) That any such violation by an insurer or rating organization which has been the subject of hearing was willful, he may suspend or revoke, in whole or in part, the certificate of authority of such insurer or the license of such rating organization with respect to the class of insurance which has been a subject of the hearing.\n\n(d) That any rating organization has willfully engaged in any fraudulent or dishonest act or practice, he may suspend or revoke, in whole or in part, the license of such organization in addition to any other penalty provided in this chapter.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all proceedings in connection with the denial, suspension or revocation of a license or certificate of authority shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapters 2 and 3, title 41, Idaho Code, and the director shall have all the powers granted to him therein.\n\n[41-1440, added 1969, ch. 306, sec. 17, p. 917; am. 1990, ch. 213, sec. 57, p. 524; am. 2005, ch. 77, sec. 15, p. 264; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 110, p. 459.]",
