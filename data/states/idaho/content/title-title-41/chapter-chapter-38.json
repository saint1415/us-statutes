The purpose of this chapter is to prevent acquisition or divestiture of control of an insurer or a holding company system of which an insurer is a part where such acquisition would be adverse to the public interest and the interests of policyholders and shareholders. A further purpose of this chapter is to promote the public interest and the interests of policyholders and shareholders by facilitating, consistent with those interests, better use of management skills and services, diversification through acquisitions, free access to capital markets, sound tax planning and open competition. An additional purpose is to monitor and regulate insurance holding company systems.\n\n[41-3801, added 2013, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 652.]",

In applying the competitive standard in this paragraph:\n\n(i) The informational requirements of section 41-3808(3)(a), Idaho Code, and the standards of section 41-3808(4)(b), Idaho Code, shall apply;\n\n(ii) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the director finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by section 41-3808(4)(c), Idaho Code, exist; and\n\n(iii) The director may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;\n\n(c) The financial condition of any acquiring party may jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders or, in the case of an acquisition of control, the interest of any remaining stockholders who are unaffiliated with the acquiring person;\n\n(d) The plans or proposals of the acquiring party to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and are not in the public interest;\n\n(e) The competence, experience and integrity of the persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders and stockholders of the insurer or of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or\n\n(f) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.\n\n(2) The public hearing referenced in subsection (1) of this section shall be held within thirty-five (35) days after the statement required by section 41-3804(1), Idaho Code, is filed or as otherwise agreed to by the director and the person filing the statement, and at least twenty-one (21) days’ notice of such hearing shall be given by the director to the person filing the statement.

Such person shall file the statement referenced in section 41-3804(1), Idaho Code, with the national association of insurance commissioners within five (5) days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the statement referenced in section 41-3804(1), Idaho Code.

Such commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend such hearing in person or by telecommunication.\n\n(4) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the director that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to section 41-3804(1)(a) of this chapter.

(1) The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section only:\n\n(a) \"Acquisition\" means any agreement, arrangement or activity, the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers;\n\n(b) \"Involved insurer\" means an insurer that either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.\n\n(2) This section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state. This section shall not apply to the following:\n\n(a) An acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the director pursuant to sections 41-3804 and 41-3806, Idaho Code;\n\n(b) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes, so long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under the provisions of section 41-3802(2), Idaho Code, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer’s state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist, and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director;\n\n(c) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the director in accordance with subsection (3)(a) of this section thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. However, such preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other subsection of this section;\n\n(d) The acquisition of already affiliated persons;\n\n(e) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:\n\n(i) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds five percent (5%) of the total market;\n\n(ii) There would be no increase in any market share; or\n\n(iii) In no market would:\n\n1. The combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds twelve percent (12%) of the total market; and\n\n2. The market share increases by more than two percent (2%) of the total market.\n\nFor the purpose of paragraph (e) of this subsection, a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state;\n\n(f) An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required pursuant to the provisions of this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; or\n\n(g) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition; the public benefits of improving the insurer’s condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director.\n\n(3) An acquisition covered by subsection (2) of this section may be subject to the issuance of an order pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification with the director. The director shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under the provisions of this subsection in the same manner as provided in section 41-3816, Idaho Code.\n\n(a) The preacquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the director relating to those markets which, under subsection (2)(e) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The director may require such additional material and information as deemed necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (4) of this section. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his ability to render an informed opinion.\n\n(b) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt by the director of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of receipt or termination of the waiting period by the director. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the director may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the director or termination of the waiting period by the director.\n\n(4) (a) The director may enter an order under subsection (5)(a) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly, or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(b) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director shall consider the following:\n\n(i) Any acquisition covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards.\n\n1. If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer AInsurer B4%4% or more10%2% or more15%1% or more\n\n2. Or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer AInsurer B5%5% or more10%4% or more15%3% or more19%1% or more\n\nA highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four (4) largest insurers is seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two (2) insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two (2) columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection. For the purpose of this determination, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be insurer A.\n\n(ii) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two (2) largest to the eight (8) largest, has increased by seven percent (7%) or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five (5) to ten (10) years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection if:\n\n1. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;\n\n2. One (1) of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and\n\n3. Another involved insurer’s market is two percent (2%) or more.\n\n(iii) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection:\n\n1. \"Insurer\" means any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control;\n\n2. \"Market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the director shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, which line is that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state;\n\n3. The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the director.\n\n(iv) Even if an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subsection (4)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, the director may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even if an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subsection (4)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subsection include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry and ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(c) An order may not be entered under subsection (5)(a) of this section if:\n\n(i) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits that would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; or\n\n(ii) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition.\n\n(5) (a) If an acquisition violates the provisions of this section, the director may enter an order:\n\n(i) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or\n\n(ii) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a certificate of authority to do business in this state.\n\n(b) Such an order shall not be entered unless:\n\n(i) A hearing has been held in accordance with chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) Notice of the hearing was issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing; and\n\n(iii) The hearing was concluded and the order issued no later than fifty-six (56) days after the date of the filing of the preacquisition notification with the director.\n\nEvery order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the director setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(c) An order entered under the provisions of this subsection shall not become final earlier than twenty-eight (28) days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such plan or other information, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the provisions of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified.\n\n(d) An order pursuant to this section shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.\n\n(e) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the director issued pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section and while the order is in effect may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing and upon order of the director, be subject at the discretion of the director to one (1) or more of the following:\n\n(i) A monetary penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for every day of violation; and/or\n\n(ii) Suspension or revocation of the person’s certificate of authority in this state.\n\n(f) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any filing requirement, shall be subject to a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).\n\n(6) Sections 41-3818(2) and (3) and 41-3820, Idaho Code, do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (2) of this section.\n\n[41-3808, added 2013, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 659.]",

For such purpose, the director may order any insurer registered under section 41-3809, Idaho Code, to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations or other method. In the event the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the director, the insurer shall provide the director with a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information. Whenever it appears to the director that the detailed explanation is without merit, the director may require, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, that the insurer pay a penalty in the amount and in the manner provided in section 41-3819(1), Idaho Code, and may suspend or revoke the insurer’s license.\n\n(3) The director may retain at the registered insurer’s expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the director’s staff as shall be reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination referenced in subsection (1) of this section.

Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. Every person shall be obligated to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. He shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in the district court, which fees, mileage and actual expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of witnesses, and their testimony, shall be itemized and charged against and be paid by the company being examined.\n\n[41-3814, added 2013, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 670.]",

      "text": "41-3815A. GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS. (1) The director is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this section. However, the director may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:\n\n(a) Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;\n\n(b) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States, but not in this state; or\n\n(c) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and in this state, but the director has determined pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections (2) and (6) of this section that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.\n\nAn insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the director make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the director will identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The director may determine that the director is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state. However, the director may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The director shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:\n\n(a) The place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group who hold the largest share of the group’s written premiums, assets, or liabilities;\n\n(b) The place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer(s) in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(c) The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(d) Whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system that the director determines to be:\n\n(i) Substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of this state; or\n\n(ii) Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and\n\n(e) Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the director with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation. However, a director or regulatory official from another jurisdiction identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in this subsection, shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group, and shall be made in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the director shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor. However, in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in:\n\n(a) The internationally active insurance group’s insurers domiciled in this state holding the largest share of the group’s premiums, assets, or liabilities; or\n\n(b) This state being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer(s) in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group, the director shall make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for such an internationally active insurance group pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(4) Pursuant to section 41-3814, Idaho Code, the director is authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to section 41-3809, Idaho Code, all information necessary to determine whether the director may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the director may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the director, the director shall notify the insurer registered pursuant to section 41-3809, Idaho Code, and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have no fewer than thirty (30) days to provide the director with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The director shall publish on the department of insurance website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the director has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the director.\n\n(5) If the director is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director is authorized to engage in any of the following group-wide supervision activities:\n\n(a) Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:\n\n(i) The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and\n\n(ii) Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;\n\n(b) Request, from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the director’s supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including, but not limited to, information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:\n\n(i) Governance, risk assessment, and management;\n\n(ii) Capital adequacy; and\n\n(iii) Material intercompany transactions;\n\n(c) Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of such internationally active insurance group engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n(d) Communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 41-3816, Idaho Code, through supervisory colleges as set forth in section 41-3815, Idaho Code, or otherwise;\n\n(e) Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under section 41-3809, Idaho Code, any member of the internationally active insurance group and any other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the director’s role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and\n\n(f) Other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated in this subsection, as considered necessary by the director.\n\n(6) If the director acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the national association of insurance commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the director is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor, provided that:\n\n(a) The director’s cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state; and\n\n(b) The regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the director’s activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the director is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.\n\n(7) The director is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under section 41-3809, Idaho Code, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official’s role as group-wide supervisor.\n\n(8) The director may promulgate rules necessary for the administration of this section.\n\n(9) A registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the director’s participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and any other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.\n\n[41-3815A, added 2019, ch. 81, sec. 2, p. 189.]",

After notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the director may also order the insurer to void any contracts and restore the status quo if such action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors or the public.\n\n(4) Whenever it appears to the director that any insurer or any director, officer, employee or agent thereof has committed a willful violation of this chapter, the director may seek criminal proceedings to be instituted by referring the matter to the attorney general or the county prosecutor in the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located, or if the insurer has no office in this state, then in Ada county, Idaho, against the insurer or the responsible director, officer, employee or agent thereof. Any insurer who willfully violates the provisions of this chapter may be fined not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000). Any individual who willfully violates the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a felony and may be imprisoned for not more than two (2) years or fined in his individual capacity not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both.\n\n(5) Any officer, director or employee of an insurance holding company system who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made any false statements or false reports or false filings with the intent to deceive the director in the performance of his duties under the provisions of this chapter, upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not more than three (3) years or fined five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both. Any fines imposed shall be paid by the officer, director or employee in his individual capacity.\n\n(6) Whenever it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of the provisions of section 41-3804, Idaho Code, and which prevents the director from fully understanding the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, such violation may serve as an independent basis for the director’s disapproval of dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance with chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code.\n\n[41-3819, added 2013, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 673.]",

MUTUAL INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES.\n\n(1) (a) A domestic mutual insurer, upon approval of the director, may reorganize by forming an insurance holding company system, which shall be designated as \"a mutual insurance holding company,\" based upon a mutual insurance company plan and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing insurer as a stock insurer. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41-3806, Idaho Code, if satisfied that the interests of the policyholders are properly protected and that the plan of reorganization is fair and equitable to the policyholders, may approve the proposed plan of reorganization and may require as a condition of approval such modifications of the proposed plan of reorganization as the director finds necessary for the protection of the policyholders’ interests. The director may retain consultants for this purpose as provided in section 41-3806(5), Idaho Code. A reorganization pursuant to this section is subject to the requirements of sections 41-3804 and 41-3805, Idaho Code. The director shall retain jurisdiction over a mutual insurance holding company organized pursuant to this section to assure that policyholder interests are protected.\n\n(b) All of the initial shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer shall be issued to the mutual insurance holding company. The membership interests of the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall become membership interests in the mutual insurance holding company. Policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall be members of the mutual insurance holding company in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual insurance holding company. The mutual insurance holding company shall at all times own a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer.\n\n(2) (a) A domestic mutual insurer, upon the approval of the director, may reorganize by merging its policyholders’ membership interests into a mutual insurance holding company formed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing insurer as a stock insurer subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41-3806, Idaho Code, if satisfied that the interests of the policyholders are properly protected and that the merger is fair and equitable to the policyholders, may approve the proposed merger and may require as a condition of approval such modifications of the proposed merger as the director finds necessary for the protection of the policyholders’ interests. For this purpose, the director may retain consultants as provided in section 41-3806(5), Idaho Code. A merger pursuant to this subsection is subject to sections 41-3804 and 41-3805, Idaho Code. The director shall retain jurisdiction over the mutual insurance holding company organized pursuant to this section to assure that policyholder interests are protected.\n\n(b) All of the initial shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer shall be issued to the mutual insurance holding company. The membership interests of the policyholders of the reorganized insurance company shall become membership interests in the mutual insurance holding company. Policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall be members of the mutual insurance holding company in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual insurance holding company. The mutual insurance holding company shall at all times own a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer. A merger of policyholders’ membership interests in a mutual insurer into a mutual insurance holding company shall be deemed to be a merger of insurance companies pursuant to section 41-2857, Idaho Code, and is subject to the requirements of section 41-2857, Idaho Code.\n\n(c) A foreign mutual insurer that is a domestic insurer organized under chapter 3, title 41, Idaho Code, may reorganize upon the approval of the director and in compliance with the requirements of any law or rule applicable to the foreign mutual insurer by merging its policyholders’ membership interests into a mutual insurance holding company formed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing foreign mutual insurer as a foreign stock insurer subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41-3806, Idaho Code, may approve the proposed merger. The director may retain consultants as provided in section 41-3806(5), Idaho Code. A merger pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the requirements of sections 41-3804 and 41-3805, Idaho Code. The reorganizing foreign mutual insurer may remain a foreign company or foreign corporation after the merger and may be admitted to do business in this state, upon approval by the director. A foreign mutual insurer that is a party to the merger may at the same time redomesticate in this state by complying with the applicable requirements of this state and its state of domicile. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection shall apply to a merger authorized under this paragraph.\n\n(3) A mutual insurance holding company resulting from the reorganization of a domestic mutual insurer organized under chapter 21, title 30, Idaho Code, shall be incorporated pursuant to chapter 21, title 30, Idaho Code. This requirement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of chapter 21, title 30, Idaho Code. The articles of incorporation and any amendments to such articles of the mutual insurance holding company shall be subject to approval of the director in the same manner as those of an insurance company.\n\n(4) A mutual insurance holding company is deemed to be an insurer subject to chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, and shall automatically be a party to any proceeding under chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, involving an insurer that, as a result of a reorganization pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section, is a subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. In any proceeding under chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, involving the reorganized insurer, the assets of the mutual insurance holding company are deemed to be assets of the estate of the reorganized insurer for purposes of satisfying the claims of the reorganized insurer’s policyholders. A mutual insurance holding company shall not be dissolved or liquidated without the prior approval of the director or as ordered by the district court pursuant to chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) (a) Section 41-2855, Idaho Code, is not applicable to a reorganization or merger pursuant to this section.\n\n(b) Section 41-2855, Idaho Code, is applicable to demutualization of a mutual insurance holding company that resulted from the reorganization of a domestic mutual insurer organized pursuant to chapter 3, title 41, Idaho Code, as if the domestic mutual insurer were a mutual life insurer.\n\n(6) A membership interest in a domestic mutual insurance holding company shall not constitute a security as defined in section 30-14-102(28), Idaho Code.\n\n(7) The majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer, which is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, shall not be conveyed, transferred, assigned, pledged, subject to a security interest or lien, encumbered or otherwise hypothecated or alienated by the mutual insurance holding company or intermediate holding company. Any conveyance, transfer, assignment, pledge, security interest, lien, encumbrance, hypothecation or alienation of, in or on the majority of the voting shares of the reorganized insurer that is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, is in violation of the provisions of this section and shall be void in inverse chronological order of the date of such conveyance, transfer, assignment, pledge, security interest, lien, encumbrance or hypothecation or alienation, as to the shares necessary to constitute a majority of such voting shares. The majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company shall not be subject to execution and levy as provided in title 11, Idaho Code. The shares of the capital stock of the surviving or new company resulting from a merger or consolidation of two (2) or more reorganized insurers or two (2) or more intermediate holding companies that were subsidiaries of the same mutual insurance holding company are subject to the same requirements, restrictions and limitations as provided in this section to which the shares of the merging or consolidating reorganized insurers or intermediate holding companies were subject as provided in this section prior to the merger or consolidation.\n\n(a) As used in this section, \"majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer\" means shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that carry the right to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the reorganized insurer. The ownership of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that is required pursuant to this section to be at all times owned by a parent mutual insurance holding company includes indirect ownership through one (1) or more intermediate holding companies in a corporate structure approved by the director. However, indirect ownership through one (1) or more intermediate holding companies shall not result in the mutual insurance holding company owning less than the equivalent of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer. The director shall have jurisdiction over an intermediate holding company as if it were a mutual insurance holding company.\n\n(b) As used in this section, \"intermediate holding company\" means a holding company that is a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company and that either directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company has one (1) or more subsidiary-reorganized insurers of which a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock would otherwise have been required pursuant to this section to be at all times owned by the mutual insurance holding company.\n\n(8) It is the intent of the legislature that the formation of a mutual insurance holding company shall not increase the Idaho tax burden of the mutual insurance holding company system and that a stock insurance subsidiary shall continue to be subject to Idaho insurance premium taxation in lieu of all other taxes except real property taxes as provided in section 41-405, Idaho Code. Subject to approval by the director as required under Idaho law, a stock insurance subsidiary may issue dividends or distributions to the mutual insurance holding company or any intermediate holding company and such dividends or distributions shall be excluded from the Idaho taxable income of the recipients; provided however, that such exclusion shall not apply if, in the year preceding the year in which the dividends or distributions were made, the subsidiary insurer’s liability for Idaho premium tax was less than the amount of Idaho income tax, computed after allowance for income tax credits, for which the insurer would have been liable in such year had the insurer been subject to Idaho income taxation rather than premium taxation.\n\n[41-3824, added 2013, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 676; am. 2017, ch. 58, sec. 26, p. 119.]",
