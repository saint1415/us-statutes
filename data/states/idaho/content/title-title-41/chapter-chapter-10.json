An enrolled customer shall be entitled to reject any change to the terms and conditions or cancel coverage, and the person who paid the premium shall receive a pro rata refund or credit of any applicable unearned premium within sixty (60) days of the receipt of notice from the customer that he wishes to cancel coverage.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, an insurer may terminate an enrolled customer’s enrollment under a portable electronics insurance policy upon fifteen (15) days’ notice for discovery of fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining coverage or in the presentation of a claim thereunder.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, an insurer may immediately terminate an enrolled customer’s enrollment under a portable electronics insurance policy:\n\n(a) For nonpayment of premium;\n\n(b) If the enrolled customer ceases to have an active service with the vendor of portable electronics; or\n\n(c) If an enrolled customer exhausts the aggregate limit of liability under the terms of the portable electronics insurance policy and the insurer sends notice of termination to the enrolled customer within thirty (30) calendar days after exhaustion of the limit. However, if notice is not timely sent, enrollment shall continue notwithstanding the aggregate limit of liability until the insurer sends notice of termination to the enrolled customer and specifies the date of such termination.\n\n(5) Where a portable electronics insurance policy is terminated by a policyholder, the policyholder shall mail or deliver written notice to each enrolled customer advising the enrolled customer of the termination of the policy and the effective date of termination.
