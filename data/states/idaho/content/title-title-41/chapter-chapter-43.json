      "text": "41-4303. COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS. (1) This chapter shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection (2) of this section:\n\n(a) To persons, except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts who, regardless of where they reside, are the beneficiaries, assignees or payees of the persons covered under paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(b) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the policies or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, and in each case who:\n\n(i) Are residents; or\n\n(ii) Are not residents, but only under all of the following conditions:\n\n1. The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this state;\n\n2. The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by this chapter; and\n\n3. The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state’s guaranty association law.\n\n(c) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (2) of this section, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall not apply, and this chapter shall, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection, provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee:\n\n(i) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or\n\n(ii) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions:\n\n1.(A) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident; or\n\n(B) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is not a resident; but the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state; and the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association created in this chapter; and\n\n2. Neither the payee or beneficiary nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.\n\n(d) The provisions of this chapter shall not provide coverage to:\n\n(i) A person who is a payee or beneficiary of a contract owner resident of this state, if the payee or beneficiary is afforded any coverage by the association of another state; or\n\n(ii) A person who acquires rights to receive payments through a structured settlement factoring transaction as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5891(c)(3)(A), regardless of whether the transaction occurred before or after such section became effective.\n\n(e) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person shall not be provided coverage under this chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this paragraph in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one (1) state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary or assignee, the provisions of this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one (1) association.\n\n(2)(a) The provisions of this chapter shall provide coverage to the persons specified in subsection (1) of this section for direct, non-group life, health or annuity policies or contracts and for certificates under direct group policies and contracts and for supplemental contracts to any of these, except as limited by this chapter. Annuity contracts and certificates under group annuity contracts include allocated funding agreements, structured settlement annuities and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts.\n\n(b) The provisions of this chapter shall not provide coverage for:\n\n(i) A portion of a policy or contract not guaranteed by the insurer, or under which the risk is borne by the policy or contract owner;\n\n(ii) A policy or contract of reinsurance, unless assumption certificates have been issued pursuant to the reinsurance policy or contract;\n\n(iii) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the rate of interest on which it is based, or the interest rate, crediting rate or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value:\n\n1.

On and after the date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under the provisions of this chapter, whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting three (3) percentage points from Moody’s corporate bond yield average as most recently available;\n\n(iv) A portion of a policy or contract issued to a plan or program of an employer, association or other person to provide life, health or annuity benefits to its employees, members or others, to the extent that the plan or program is self-funded or uninsured including, but not limited to, benefits payable by an employer, association or other person under:\n\n1. A multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in section 3(40) of the employee retirement income security act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. section 1002(40);\n\n2. A minimum premium group insurance plan;\n\n3. A stop-loss group insurance plan; or\n\n4.

Payment of any fees or allowances to any person, including the policy or contract owner, in connection with the service to or administration of the policy or contract;\n\n(vi) A policy or contract issued in this state by a member insurer at a time when it was not licensed or did not have a certificate of authority to issue the policy or contract in this state;\n\n(vii) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the assessments required in section 41-4309, Idaho Code, with respect to the policy or contract are preempted by federal or state law;\n\n(viii) An obligation that does not arise under the express written terms of the policy or contract issued by the insurer to the contract owner or policy owner, including without limitation:\n\n1. Claims based on marketing materials;\n\n2. Claims based on side letters, riders or other documents that were issued by the insurer without meeting applicable policy form filing or approval requirements;\n\n3. Misrepresentations of or regarding policy benefits;\n\n4. Extra-contractual claims; or\n\n5. A claim for penalties or consequential or incidental damages;\n\n(ix) A contractual agreement that establishes the member insurer’s obligations to provide a book value accounting guaranty for defined contribution benefit plan participants by reference to a portfolio of assets that is owned by the benefit plan or its trustee, which in each case is not an affiliate of the member insurer;\n\n(x) An unallocated annuity contract;\n\n(xi) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent it provides for interest or other changes in value to be determined by the use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract, but which have not been credited to the policy or contract, or as to which the policy or contract owner’s rights are subject to forfeiture, as of the date the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under the provisions of this chapter, whichever is earlier. If a policy’s or contract’s interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, then for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subparagraph, the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be subject to forfeiture;\n\n(xii) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug or other health care benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. part C or 42 U.S.C. part D, commonly known as medicare parts C and D, or any regulations issued pursuant thereto; and\n\n(xiii) Structured settlement annuity benefits to which a payee or beneficiary has transferred his rights in a structured settlement factoring transaction as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5891(c)(3)(A), regardless of whether the transaction occurred before or after such section became effective.\n\n(c) The exclusion for coverage described in paragraph (b)(iii) of this subsection shall not apply to any portion of a policy or contract, including a rider, that provides long-term care or any other health insurance benefits.\n\n(3) The benefits that the association may become obligated to cover shall in no event exceed the lesser of:\n\n(a) The contractual obligations for which the insurer is liable or would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer; or\n\n(b) Subject to the aggregate per life limitation in paragraph (c) of this subsection with respect to one (1) policy or contract:\n\n(i) Three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in life insurance death benefits, but not more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values for life insurance;\n\n(ii) Three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in health insurance claims or benefit payments or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values for health benefits, except for major medical insurance as defined in section 41-4305, Idaho Code, and as provided for in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph;\n\n(iii) Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for major medical insurance as defined in section 41-4305, Idaho Code;\n\n(iv) Two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values;\n\n(v) With respect to each payee of a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary or beneficiaries of the payee if deceased, two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in present value annuity benefits, in the aggregate, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values;\n\n(c) However, in no event shall the association be obligated to cover more than:\n\n(i) An aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in benefits with respect to any one (1) life under paragraph (b) of this subsection, except with respect to benefits for major medical insurance as provided in paragraph (b)(iii) of this subsection, in which case the aggregate liability of the association shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) with respect to any one (1) life; or\n\n(ii) With respect to one (1) owner of multiple non-group policies of life insurance, whether the policy owner is an individual, firm, corporation or other person, and whether the persons insured are officers, managers, employees or other persons, more than five million dollars ($5,000,000) in benefits, regardless of the number of policies and contracts held by the owner; or\n\n(d) The limitations set forth in this subsection are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either its subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies. The costs of the association’s obligations under the provisions of this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.\n\n(e) For purposes of this act, benefits provided by a long-term care rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract shall be considered the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity contract to which it relates.\n\n(4) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under section 41-4308, Idaho Code, the association shall not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.\n\n[41-4303, added 2011, ch. 196, sec. 2, p. 559; am. 2018, ch. 192, sec. 1, p. 418; am. 2025, ch. 60, sec. 1, p. 275.]",

The association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates that it shall adopt. The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy was last underwritten; and\n\n3. Any alternative policy issued by the association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association;\n\n(vi) If the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy, the premium shall be set by the association in accordance with the amount of insurance provided and the age and class of risk, subject to approval of the domiciliary insurance director;\n\n(vii) The association’s obligations with respect to coverage under any policy of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative policy shall cease on the date the coverage or policy is replaced by another similar policy by the policy owner, the insured or the association; and\n\n(viii) When proceeding under this paragraph (b) of this subsection with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with section 41-4303(2)(b)(iii), Idaho Code.\n\n(c) With respect to health benefit plans that are subject to state or federal guaranteed issue requirements, the association may terminate the policies upon entry of an order of liquidation with approval of the director.\n\n(3) Nonpayment of premiums within thirty-one (31) days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the association’s obligations under the policy or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(4) Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the association. If the liquidator of an insolvent insurer requests, the association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premium collected by the association. The association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.\n\n(5) The protection provided by this chapter shall not apply where any guarantee protection is provided to residents of this state by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this state.\n\n(6) In carrying out its duties under subsection (2) of this section, the association may:\n\n(a) Subject to approval by a court in this state, impose permanent policy or contract liens in connection with a guarantee, assumption or reinsurance agreement, if the association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association’s duties under this chapter, or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens, to be in the public interest; or\n\n(b) Subject to approval by a court in this state, impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or policy loans, or on any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans or other rights by the association for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.\n\n(7) A deposit in this state, held pursuant to law or required by the director for the benefit of creditors, including policy owners, not turned over to the domiciliary liquidator upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of an insurer domiciled in this state or in a reciprocal state, pursuant to chapter 8, title 41, Idaho Code, shall be promptly paid to the association. The association shall be entitled to retain a portion of any amount so paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy owners’ claims related to that insolvency for which the association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy owners’ claims in this state related to that insolvency and shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount so paid to the association less the amount retained pursuant to this subsection. Any amount so paid to the association and retained by it shall be treated as a distribution of state assets pursuant to applicable state receivership law dealing with early access disbursements.\n\n(8) If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time with respect to an insolvent insurer, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the director shall have the powers and duties of the association under this chapter with respect to the insolvent insurer.\n\n(9) The association may render assistance and advice to the director, upon the director’s request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(10) The association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated under this chapter or with jurisdiction over any person or property against which the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association including, but not limited to, proposals for reinsuring, modifying or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The association shall also have the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person or property against whom the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise.\n\n(11) (a) A person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from or otherwise relating to the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of, or on account of, contractual obligations, continuation of coverage or provision of substitute or alternative coverages. The association may require a written instrument of assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon the person.\n\n(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.\n\n(c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contract, including without limitation, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received pursuant to this chapter, against a person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or payment therefor, excepting any such person responsible solely by reason of serving as an assignee in respect of a qualified assignment under Internal Revenue Code, section 130.\n\n(d) If the preceding provisions of this subsection are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(e) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(12) In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may:\n\n(a) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter;\n\n(b) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under section 41-4309, Idaho Code, and to settle claims or potential claims against it;\n\n(c) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter; any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;\n\n(d) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter;\n\n(e) Take such legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims;\n\n(f) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter;\n\n(g) Reorganize itself with the prior written approval of the director from a nonprofit association into a corporation or other legal form of nonprofit entity permitted by the laws of the state of Idaho;\n\n(h) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request; and\n\n(i) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter.\n\n(13) The association may join an organization of one (1) or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.\n\n(14) With respect to covered policies for which the association becomes obligated after an entry of an order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights of the insolvent insurer arising after the order of liquidation under any contract of reinsurance to which the insolvent insurer was a party, to the extent that such contract provides coverage for losses occurring after the date of the order of liquidation. As a condition to making this election, the association must pay all unpaid premiums due under the contract for coverage relating to periods before and after the date of the order of liquidation.\n\n(15) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner.\n\n(16) Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association’s obligations under this chapter, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.\n\n(17) Venue in a suit against the association arising under this chapter shall be in Ada county. The association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(18) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming or reinsuring policies or contracts under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(a) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for:\n\n(i) A fixed interest rate;\n\n(ii) Payment of dividends with minimum guarantees; or\n\n(iii) A different method for calculating interest or changes in value;\n\n(b) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and\n\n(c) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.\n\n[41-4308, added 2011, ch. 196, sec. 2, p. 566; am. 2018, ch. 192, sec. 2, p. 422.]",

      "text": "41-4309. ASSESSMENTS. (1) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board of directors finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than thirty (30) days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at eight percent (8%) per annum on and after the due date.\n\n(2) There shall be two (2) classes of assessments:\n\n(a) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(b) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under section 41-4308, Idaho Code, with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.\n\n(3)(a) The amount of a class A assessment shall be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If pro rata, the board of directors may provide that it be credited against future class B assessments.\n\n(b) The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula, which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board of directors in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n(c) The amount of a class B assessment for long-term care insurance shall be allocated according to a methodology selected by the association and approved by the director, which methodology shall provide for fifty percent (50%) of the assessment to be allocated to health member insurers and fifty percent (50%) to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.\n\n(d) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account for the calendar year preceding the assessments bears to such premiums received on business in this state for the calendar year preceding the assessment by all assessed member insurers.\n\n(e) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under this subsection and subsection (2) of this section and computation of assessments under this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty (180) days after the assessment is authorized.\n\n(4) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board of directors, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.\n\n(5)(a) The total of all class B assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in one (1) calendar year exceed two percent (2%) of such insurer’s premiums received in this state during the calendar year preceding the assessment on the policies covered by the account. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in any one (1) year in an account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.\n\n(b) The board of directors may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one (1) or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.\n\n(6) The board of directors may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board of directors finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains and income from investments.\n\nA reasonable amount, as determined by the board of directors in its discretion, may be retained by the association in any account to provide funds for the continuing and future expenses of the association and for future loss claims.\n\n(7) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.\n\n(8) The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a class A assessment, a certificate of contribution in a form prescribed by the director for the amount of the assessment so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the director may approve.\n\n(9)(a) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest.\n\n(b) Within sixty (60) days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest.\n\n(c) Within thirty (30) days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director.\n\n(d) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association.\n\n(e) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer.\n\n(10) The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section, and member insurers shall promptly comply with the request.\n\n[41-4309, added 2011, ch. 196, sec. 2, p. 571; am. 2018, ch. 192, sec. 3, p. 427; am. 2025, ch. 60, sec. 3, p. 282.]",

Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subsection, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(4) As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer, as established in subsection (3) of this section and consistent with section 41-3334, Idaho Code, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty (120) days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets.\n\n(5) (a) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer.\n\n(b) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under section 41-4308, Idaho Code, with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association.\n\n(6) (a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five (5) years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection.\n\n(b) No such distribution shall be recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\n(c) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two (2) or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.\n\n(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.\n\n(e) If any person liable under paragraph (c) of this subsection is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.\n\n[41-4314, added 2011, ch. 196, sec. 2, p. 575.]",
