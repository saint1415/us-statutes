(1) There shall be a provision that after three (3) full years’ premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security thereof, an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled thereto, less than the loan value of the policy. A policy issued after July 1, 1975, and prior to July 1, 1982, shall contain either, but not both of the following policy loan interest rate provisions:\n\n(a) A provision that a policy loan shall bear interest at a specified rate (not exceeding eight per cent (8%) per annum); or\n\n(b) A provision that all loans under the policy, including outstanding loans, shall bear interest at a variable rate (not exceeding eight per cent (8%) per annum), specified from time to time by the insurer.\n\nThe effective date of any increase in such variable rate shall be not less than one (1) year after the effective date of the establishment of the previous rate. If the interest rate is increased, the amount of such increase shall not exceed one per cent (1%) per annum. The variable rate may be decreased without restriction as to amount or frequency. With respect to policies providing for a variable rate, the insurer shall,\n\n1. when a loan is made and when notification of interest due is furnished, give notice of the variable rate currently effective;\n\n2. as to any loans outstanding forty (40) days before the effective date of any increase in the variable rate, give notice of any such increase at least thirty (30) days before such effective date; and\n\n3. as to any loans made during the forty (40) days before the effective date of the increase, give notice of such increase when the loan is made. Every such notice shall be given as directed by the policy owner and any assignee as shown on the records of the insurer at its home office.\n\n(2) (a) Policies issued on or after July 1, 1982 shall provide for policy loan interest rates as follows:\n\n1. A provision permitting a maximum interest rate of not more than eight per cent (8%) per annum; or\n\n2. A provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established from time to time by the life insurer as permitted by law.\n\n(b) The rate of interest charged on a policy loan made under subsection (2)(a)2. shall not exceed the higher of the following:\n\n1. The published monthly average for the calendar month ending two (2) months before the date on which the rate is determined; or\n\n2. The rate used to compute the cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus one per cent (1%) per annum.\n\n(c) For purposes of this section the \"published monthly average\" means:\n\n1. Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average — Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or any successor thereto; or\n\n2. In the event that Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average — Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published, a substantially similar average, established by regulation issued by the director.\n\n(d) If the maximum rate of interest is determined pursuant to subsection (2)(a)2., the policy shall contain a provision setting forth the frequency at which the rate is to be determined for that policy.\n\n(e) The maximum rate for each policy must be determined at regular intervals at least once every twelve (12) months, but not more frequently than once in any three (3) month period. At the intervals specified in the policy:\n\n1. The rate being charged may be increased whenever such increase as determined under subsection (2)(b) would increase that rate by one-half per cent (.5%) or more per annum; or\n\n2. The rate being charged must be reduced whenever such reduction as determined under subsection (2)(b) would decrease that rate by one-half per cent (.5%) or more per annum.\n\n(f) The life insurer shall:\n\n1. Notify the policyholder at the time a cash loan is made of the initial rate of interest on the loan;\n\n2. Notify the policyholder with respect to premium loans of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so after making the initial loan. Notice need not be given to the policyholder when a further premium loan is added, except as provided in (f)3. hereof;\n\n3. Sent to policyholders with loans reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate; and\n\n4. Include in the notices required above the substance of the pertinent provisions of subsections (2)(a) and (2)(d).\n\n(g) No policy shall terminate in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year, and the life insurer shall maintain coverage during that policy year until the time at which it would otherwise have terminated if there had been no change during that policy year.\n\n(h) The substance of the pertinent provisions of subsections (2)(a) and (2)(d) shall be set forth in the policies to which they apply.\n\n(i) For purposes of this section:\n\n1. The rate of interest on policy loans permitted under this section includes the interest rate charged on reinstatement of policy loans for the period during and after any lapse of a policy.\n\n2. The term \"policy loan\" includes any premium loan made under a policy to pay one or more premiums that were not paid to the life insurer as they fell due.\n\n3. The term \"policyholder\" includes the owner of the policy or the person designated to pay premiums as shown on the records of the life insurer.\n\n4. The term \"policy\" includes certificates issued by a fraternal benefit society and annuity contracts which provide for policy loans.\n\n(j) No other provision of law shall apply to policy loan interest rates unless made specifically applicable to such rates.\n\n(k) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurance contract issued before July 1, 1981 unless the policyholder agrees in writing to the applicability of such provisions.\n\n(3) The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct, either from such loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining such cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and any interest which may be allowable on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value thereof, then the policy shall terminate and become void. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six (6) months after application therefor. The policy, at the insurer’s option, may provide for automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect.\n\n(4) This section shall not apply to term policies nor to term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions, or to industrial life insurance policies.\n\n[41-1909, added 1961, ch. 330, sec. 440, p. 645; am. 1975, ch. 232, sec. 1, p. 635; am. 1982, ch. 359, sec. 1, p. 908.]",

STANDARD NONFORFEITURE LAW — LIFE INSURANCE.\n\n(1) (a) This section shall be known as the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance.\n\n(b) \"Operative date of the valuation manual\" means January 1 of the first calendar year that the valuation manual, as defined in section 41-612, Idaho Code, is effective.\n\n(2) Nonforfeiture provisions: In the case of policies issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection (14) of this section, no policy of life insurance, except as set forth in subsection (13) of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements hereinafter specified and are essentially in compliance with subsection (12) of this law:\n\n(a) That in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be hereinafter specified. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.\n\n(b) That upon surrender of the policy within sixty (60) days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three (3) full years in the case of ordinary insurance, and five (5) full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.\n\n(c) That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default.\n\n(d) That if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance, or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty (30) days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.\n\n(e) In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first twenty (20) policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.\n\n(f) A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of this state; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.\n\n(3) Any of the provisions or portions thereof set forth in subdivisions (a) through (f) of the foregoing subsection (2) which are not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six (6) months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy. If the insurer defers payment of a cash surrender value under the provisions of this section, the insurer shall pay interest to the policyholder at the rate specified in section 28-22-104(2), Idaho Code, as established and in existence at the time of the surrender demand.\n\n(4) Cash surrender value: Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (2) of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions if there had been no default, over the sum of:\n\n(a) The then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections (6) through (9) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and\n\n(b) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy. Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) as defined therein, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in the first paragraph of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision. Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) as defined therein, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse’s age seventy-one (71), the cash surrender value referred to in the first paragraph of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.\n\nAny cash surrender value available within thirty (30) days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments, or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, whether or not required by such subsection (2), shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.\n\n(5) Paid-up nonforfeiture benefits: Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy, or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the conditions that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.\n\n(6) The adjusted premium: This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) as defined therein. Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:\n\n(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;\n\n(b) Two per cent (2%) of the amount of the insurance if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy;\n\n(c) Forty per cent (40%) of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;\n\n(d) Twenty-five per cent (25%) of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in subdivisions (c) and (d) above, no adjusted premiums shall be deemed to exceed four per cent (4%) of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. Whenever the plan or term of a policy has been changed, either by request of the insured or automatically in accordance with the provisions of the policy, the date of issue of the changed policy for the purposes of determining a nonforfeiture benefit or cash surrender value shall be the date as of which the age of the insured is determined for the purposes of the changed policy. The date of issue of a policy for the purposes of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n(7) In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of the preceding subsection (6) shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, provided, however, that in the case of a policy for a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten (10), the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten (10) were the amount provided by such policy at age ten (10).\n\n(8) The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by any rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (a) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and as specified in subsections (6) and (7) except that, for the purposes of subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (6), the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (b) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (4)(a).\n\n(9)(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1941 standard ordinary mortality table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated, at the option of the insurer according to an age not more than three (3) years younger than the actual age of the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 standard industrial mortality table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half per cent (3 1/2%) per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty per cent (130%) of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table, provided further that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.\n\n(b) This subsection (9)(b) shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) as defined therein. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this subdivision as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners’ 1958 standard ordinary mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent (3 1/2%) per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent (4%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1973, and prior to July 1, 1977, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent (5 1/2%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1977, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy at a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent (6 1/2%) per annum may be used and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six (6) years younger than the actual age of the insured. Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners’ 1958 extended term insurance table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.\n\nOn or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection (14) of this section, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subdivision after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer), this subdivision shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer shall be January 1, 1966.\n\n(c) This subsection (9)(c) shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (9)(d) as defined therein. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this subdivision as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners’ 1961 standard industrial mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent (3 1/2%) per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent (4%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1973, and prior to July 1, 1977, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent (5 1/2%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1977, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent (6 1/2%) per annum may be used. Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners’ 1961 industrial extended term insurance table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.\n\nAfter the effective date of this amendatory act, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subdivision after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer), this subdivision shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer shall be January 1, 1968.\n\n(d) (i) Subsection (9)(d) shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection (9)(d) as defined herein. Except as provided in paragraph vii of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) one per cent (1%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; and (C) one hundred twenty-five per cent (125%) of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined. Provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in (C) above, no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent (4%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n(ii) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.\n\n(iii) In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\n(iv) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph vii of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of the sum of (A) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (B) the additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.\n\n(v) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of (A) one per cent (1%) of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (B) one hundred twenty-five per cent (125%) of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n(vi) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where\n\n(A) equals the sum of\n\n1. the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change, times the present value of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, and\n\n2. the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, and\n\n(B) equals the present value of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.\n\n(vii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values, for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\n(viii) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of (A) the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table or (B) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten-year select mortality factors; shall, for all policies of industrial insurance, be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table; and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in that calendar year. Provided, however, that:\n\n1. At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.\n\n2. Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (2) shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.\n\n3. An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.\n\n4. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table for policies of industrial insurance.\n\n5. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables.\n\n6. (A) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table.\n\n(B) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table. If the director approves by regulation any commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n7.(A) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.\n\n(B) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table. If the director approves by regulation any commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(ix) The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined below:\n\n1. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the interest rate used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of such policy as defined in the standard valuation law, rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%).\n\n2. For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(x) Notwithstanding any other provision in this code to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.\n\n(xi) After the effective date of subsection (9)(d), any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.\n\n(10) In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on the then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (2) through (9) herein, then:\n\n(a) The director must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (2) through (9) herein;\n\n(b) The director must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;\n\n(c) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance, as determined by regulations promulgated by the director.\n\n(11) Calculation of values: Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections (4) through (9) of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, additional benefits payable:\n\n(a) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means,\n\n(b) In the event of total and permanent disability,\n\n(c) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits,\n\n(d) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply,\n\n(e) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child’s age is twenty-six (26), is uniform in amount after the child’s age is one (1), and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child, and\n\n(f) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(12) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one per cent (2/10 of 1%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years, from the sum of:\n\n(a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified; and\n\n(b) The present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.\n\nThe basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary. Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (4) or (8), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (4) or (8), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.\n\nThe nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (6) or (9)(d), whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:\n\n(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one per cent (2/10 of 1%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; and\n\n(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two (2) policy anniversaries specified in the preceding paragraph (a) may apply to fewer than five (5) consecutive policy years.\n\nProvided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (6) or (9)(d), whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.\n\nAll adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall, for a particular policy, be calculated on the same mortality and interest basis as are used in demonstrating the policy’s compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.\n\nAny cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), (9)(d) and (11). The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as items (a) through (f) in subsection (11) shall conform with the principles of this subsection (12).\n\n(13) Exceptions. This section shall not apply to any of the following:\n\n(a) Reinsurance,\n\n(b) Group insurance,\n\n(c) Variable life insurance,\n\n(d) Pure endowment,\n\n(e) Annuity or reversionary annuity contract,\n\n(f) Term policy of uniform amount which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty (20) years or less expiring before age seventy-one (71), for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy,\n\n(g) Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsections (6) through (9) of this section, is less than the adjusted premiums so calculated on a policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of twenty (20) years or less expiring before age seventy-one (71), for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;\n\n(h) Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections (4) through (9) of this section, exceeds two and one-half per cent (2 1/2%) of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year;\n\n(i) Policy which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy.\n\nFor purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.\n\n(14) Operative date. After January 1, 1962, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1963. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date for such insurer) this section shall become operative with respect to the policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such insurer shall be January 1, 1963.\n\n[41-1927, added 1961, ch. 330, sec. 458, p. 645; am. 1965, ch. 307, sec. 2, p. 822; am. 1973, ch. 274, sec. 2, p. 574; am. 1977, ch. 265, sec. 2, p. 781; am. 1982, ch. 205, sec. 2, p. 556; am. 1989, ch. 142, sec. 1, p. 332; am. 2016, ch. 68, sec. 2, p. 226.]",

      "text": "41-1927A. STANDARD NONFORFEITURE LAW FOR INDIVIDUAL DEFERRED ANNUITIES. (1) This section shall be known as the standard nonforfeiture law for individual deferred annuities.\n\n(2) This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the contract.\n\n(3) In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection (12) of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection (2) of this section shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the contractholder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract.\n\n(a) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, the insurer will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) of this section.\n\n(b) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the insurer will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in subsections (5), (6), (8) and (10) of this section. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of six (6) months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract. If the insurer defers payment of a cash surrender benefit under this section, the insurer shall pay interest at the rate specified in section 28-22-104(2), Idaho Code, as established and in existence at the time of the surrender demand.\n\n(c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits.\n\n(d) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract, any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements of this section, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two (2) full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than twenty dollars ($20.00) monthly, the insurer may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract.\n\n(4) The minimum values as specified in subsections (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section.\n\n(a) The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4)(b) of this section of the net considerations (as hereinafter defined) paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of subparagraphs (4)(a)(i) through (iv) below:\n\n(i) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4)(b) of this section;\n\n(ii) An annual contract charge of fifty dollars ($50.00), accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4)(b) of this section;\n\n(iii) Any premium tax paid by the insurer for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4)(b) of this section, provided that the premium tax credit is only permitted if the tax is actually paid by the insurer, and provided further that if the tax is paid and subsequently credited back to the insurer, such as upon early termination of the contract, the tax credit may not be taken; and\n\n(iv) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued.\n\nThe net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to eighty-seven and one-half percent (87.5%) of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.\n\n(b) The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent (3%) per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:\n\n(i) The five (5) year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent (.2%), specified in the contract no longer than fifteen (15) months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under subsection (4)(b)(iv) of this section;\n\n(ii) Reduced by one hundred twenty-five (125) basis points;\n\n(iii) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent (1%); and\n\n(iv) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five (5) year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.\n\n(c) During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subsection (4)(b)(ii) of this section by up to an additional one hundred (100) basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the director, the director may disallow or limit the additional reduction.\n\n(d) The director may adopt rules to implement the provisions of subsection (4)(c) of this section and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts that the director determines adjustments are justified.\n\n(5) Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. Such present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.\n\n(6) For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, such cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent (1%) higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.\n\n(7) For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.\n\n(8) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections (6) and (7) of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant’s seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.\n\n(9) Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.\n\n(10) Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.\n\n(11) For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) of this section, additional benefits payable (i) in the event of total and permanent disability, (ii) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (iii) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment, and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.\n\n(12) After the effective date of this section any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before the second anniversary of the effective date of this section. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this section for such insurer, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such insurer shall be the second anniversary of the effective date of this section.\n\n[41-1927A, added 1977, ch. 265, sec. 3, p. 788; am. 1989, ch. 142, sec. 2, p. 344; am. 2003, ch. 86, sec. 1, p. 261; am. 2004, ch. 92, sec. 1, p. 332.]",

A producer, when making a recommendation of an annuity, shall act in the best interest of the consumer under the circumstances known at the time the recommendation is made without placing the producer’s or the insurer’s financial interest ahead of the consumer’s interest. A producer has acted in the best interest of the consumer if he has satisfied the following obligations regarding care, disclosure, conflict of interest, and documentation:\n\n(a) Care obligation. The producer, in making a recommendation, shall exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill to:\n\n(i) Know the consumer’s financial situation, insurance needs, and financial objectives;\n\n(ii) Understand the available recommendation options after making a reasonable inquiry into options available to the producer;\n\n(iii) Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommended option effectively addresses the consumer’s financial situation, insurance needs, and financial objectives over the life of the product, as evaluated in light of the consumer profile information; and\n\n(iv) Communicate the basis or bases of the recommendation.\n\n(b) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection include making reasonable efforts to obtain consumer profile information from the consumer prior to the recommendation of an annuity.\n\n(c) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection require a producer to consider the types of products the producer is authorized and licensed to recommend or sell that address the consumer’s financial situation, insurance needs, and financial objectives. This does not require analysis or consideration of any products outside the authority and license of the producer or other possible alternative products or strategies available in the market at the time of the recommendation. Producers shall be held to standards applicable to producers with similar authority and licensure.\n\n(d) The requirements under this subsection do not create a fiduciary obligation or relationship and create only a regulatory obligation as established in this section.\n\n(e) The consumer profile information, characteristics of the insurer, and product costs, rates, benefits, and features are those factors generally relevant in making a determination whether an annuity effectively addresses the consumer’s financial situation, insurance needs, and financial objectives, but the level of importance of each factor under the care obligation of this subsection may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. However, each factor may not be considered in isolation.\n\n(f) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection include having a reasonable basis to believe the consumer would benefit from certain features of the annuity, such as annuitization, death or living benefit, or other insurance-related features.\n\n(g) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection apply to the particular annuity as a whole and the underlying subaccounts to which funds are allocated at the time of purchase or exchange of an annuity and to riders and similar producer enhancements, if any.\n\n(h) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection do not mean the annuity with the lowest onetime or multiple occurrence compensation structure shall necessarily be recommended.\n\n(i) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this subsection do not mean the producer has ongoing monitoring obligations under the care obligation pursuant to this subsection, although such an obligation may be separately owed under the terms of a fiduciary, consulting, investment advising, or financial planning agreement between the consumer and the producer.\n\n(j) In the case of an exchange or replacement of an annuity, the producer shall consider the whole transaction, which includes taking into consideration whether:\n\n(i) The consumer will incur a surrender charge, be subject to the commencement of a new surrender period, lose existing benefits such as death, living, or other contractual benefits, or be subject to increased fees, investment advisory fees, or charges for riders and similar product enhancements;\n\n(ii) The replacing product would substantially benefit the consumer in comparison to the replaced product over the life of the product; and\n\n(iii) The consumer has had another annuity exchange or replacement and, in particular, an exchange or replacement within the preceding sixty (60) months.\n\n(k) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a producer to obtain any license other than a producer license with the appropriate line of authority to sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance in this state, including but not limited to any securities license, in order to fulfill the duties and obligations contained in this section; provided the producer does not give advice or provide services that are otherwise subject to securities laws or engage in any other activity requiring other professional licenses.\n\n(4) Disclosure obligation.\n\n(a) Prior to the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall prominently disclose to the consumer on a form prescribed by the director or substantially similar thereto the following:\n\n(i) A description of the scope and terms of the relationship with the consumer and the role of the producer in the transaction;\n\n(ii) An affirmative statement on whether the producer is licensed and authorized to sell the following products:\n\n1. Fixed annuities;\n\n2. Fixed indexed annuities;\n\n3. Variable annuities;\n\n4. Life insurance;\n\n5. Mutual funds;\n\n6. Stocks and bonds; and\n\n7.

From one (1) insurer;\n\n2. From two (2) or more insurers; or\n\n3. From two (2) or more insurers although primarily contracted with one (1) insurer;\n\n(iv) A description of the sources and types of cash compensation and noncash compensation to be received by the producer, including whether the producer is to be compensated for the sale of a recommended annuity by commission as part of premium or other remuneration received from the insurer, intermediary, or other producer or by fee as a result of a contract for advice or consulting services; and\n\n(v) A notice of the consumer’s right to request additional information regarding cash compensation described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.\n\n(b) Upon request of the consumer or the consumer’s designated representative, the producer shall disclose:\n\n(i) A reasonable estimate of the amount of cash compensation to be received by the producer, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages; and\n\n(ii) Whether the cash compensation is a onetime or multiple occurrence amount and, if a multiple occurrence amount, the frequency and amount of the occurrence, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages.\n\n(c) Prior to or at the time of the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall have a reasonable basis to believe the consumer has been informed of various features of the annuity, such as the potential surrender period and surrender charge, potential tax penalty if the consumer sells, exchanges, surrenders, or annuitizes the annuity, mortality and expense fees, investment advisory fees, any annual fees, potential charges for and features of riders or other options of the annuity, limitations on interest returns, potential changes in non-guaranteed elements of the annuity, insurance and investment components, and market risk. The disclosure requirements under this subsection are intended to supplement and not replace the disclosure requirements under section 41-1941, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) Conflict of interest obligation. A producer shall identify and avoid or reasonably manage and disclose material conflicts of interest, including material conflicts of interest related to an ownership interest.\n\n(6) Documentation obligation.

However, nothing in this subsection shall limit the insurance director’s ability to investigate and enforce the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall limit the insurer’s obligation to comply with section 41-1940B(1), Idaho Code, although the insurer may base its analysis on information received from either the financial professional or the entity supervising the financial professional.\n\n(c) For paragraph (a) of this subsection to apply, an insurer shall:\n\n(i) Monitor the relevant conduct of the financial professional seeking to rely on paragraph (a) of this subsection or the entity responsible for supervising the financial professional, such as the financial professional’s broker-dealer or an investment adviser registered under federal securities laws, using information collected in the normal course of an insurer’s business; and\n\n(ii) Provide to the entity responsible for supervising the financial professional seeking to rely on paragraph (a) of this subsection, such as the financial professional’s broker-dealer or investment adviser registered under federal securities laws, information and reports that are reasonably appropriate to assist such entity to maintain its supervision system.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subsection, \"financial professional\" means a producer that is regulated and acting as:\n\n(i) A broker-dealer registered under federal securities laws or a registered representative of a broker-dealer;\n\n(ii) An investment adviser registered under federal securities laws or an investment adviser representative associated with the federal registered investment adviser; or\n\n(iii) A plan fiduciary under section 3(21) of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (ERISA) or a fiduciary under section 4975(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or any amendments or successor statutes thereto.\n\n(e) For purposes of this subsection, \"comparable standards\" means:\n\n(i) With respect to broker-dealers and registered representatives of broker-dealers, applicable SEC and FINRA rules pertaining to best interest obligations and supervision of annuity recommendations and sales, including but not limited to regulation best interest and any amendments or successor regulations thereto;\n\n(ii) With respect to investment advisers registered under federal securities laws or investment adviser representatives, the fiduciary duties and all other requirements imposed on such investment advisers or investment adviser representatives by contract or under the investment advisers act of 1940, including but not limited to the form ADV and interpretations; and\n\n(iii) With respect to plan fiduciaries or fiduciaries, the duties, obligations, prohibitions, and all other requirements attendant to such status under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code and any amendments or successor statutes thereto.\n\n[41-1940A, added 2021, ch. 41, sec. 3, p. 113.]",

(1) A life settlement provider entering into a life settlement contract shall first obtain:\n\n(a) If the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life settlement contract; and\n\n(b) A document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a licensed life settlement provider, life settlement broker and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.\n\n(2) Within twenty (20) days after an owner executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty (20) days of entering any agreement, option, promise or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to settle the policy, the life settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a settled policy. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(3) The life settlement provider shall deliver:\n\n(a) A copy of the medical release required under subsection (1)(b) of this section;\n\n(b) A copy of the owner’s application for the life settlement contract;\n\n(c) The notice required under subsection (2) of this section; and\n\n(d) A request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the life transaction. The NAIC’s form for verification of coverage shall be used unless another form is developed and approved by the director.\n\n(4) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a life settlement provider or life settlement broker within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at that time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on an NAIC form or any other form approved by the director. The insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the owner. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations under this subsection shall be a violation of section 41-1964, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) Prior to or at the time of execution of the life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the life settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the life settlement contract, that he or she has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that he or she is entering into the life settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.\n\n(6) If a life settlement broker performs these activities required of the life settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.\n\n(7) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of state and federal law relating to confidentiality of medical information.\n\n(8) All life settlement contracts entered into in this state, or covering a resident of this state as owner, shall provide the owner with an absolute right to rescind the contract within twenty (20) calendar days of the date upon which the life settlement contract is executed by all parties. Rescission by the owner is conditioned upon the owner both giving notice and repaying to the life settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the life settlement provider in connection with or as a consequence of the life settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the life settlement provider or other person of all life settlement proceeds, and any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the life settlement provider or other person. In the event of any rescission, if the life settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a life settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the life settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the life settlement provider within five (5) business days following receipt of written demand from the life settlement provider, which demand shall be accompanied by either the owner’s notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the owner, or notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.\n\n(9) The life settlement provider shall instruct the owner to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary directly to an independent escrow agent. Within three (3) business days after the date the escrow agent receives the documents, or from the date the life settlement provider receives the documents, if the owner erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the life settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally-chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the life settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the life settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent’s receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the owner.\n\n(10) Failure to tender consideration to the owner for the life settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to section 41-1956(7), Idaho Code, renders the life settlement contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the owner.\n\n(11) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the life settlement provider or life settlement broker after the life settlement has occurred shall only be made by the life settlement provider or broker licensed in this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three (3) months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one (1) year, and to no more than once per month for insureds with a life expectancy of one (1) year or less.
