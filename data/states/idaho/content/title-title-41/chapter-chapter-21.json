      "text": "41-2146. COVERAGE PROVIDED TO PERSONS HAVING INSURANCE. An insurer providing individual disability insurance coverage in this state shall make available to citizens of this state major medical disability policies under the terms set forth in this section. An insurer providing only accident-only, credit, dental, vision, long-term care or disability income insurance, coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance, worker’s compensation, or automobile medical payment insurance is not required to comply with the provisions of this section. An insurer providing only specified disease or hospital confinement indemnity insurance in this state shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this section, provided the insurance is marketed as supplemental health insurance and not as a substitute for hospital or major medical expense insurance, and the insurer certifies annually to the director that the insurance is being marketed in a manner consistent with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(2) As used in this section, the term \"major medical disability policies\" means policies, including medicare supplement insurance policies, contracts or certificates which are issued to provide hospital and medical-surgical coverage.\n\n(3) Each insurer offering or maintaining individual major medical disability policies in this state shall make current individual policies available to an individual or dependent of an individual currently insured by the insurer, without imposition by the insurer of underwriting criteria whereby coverage of an individual or a dependent of an individual is denied or subject to cancellation or nonrenewal, in whole or in part because of the individual’s age, health or medical history or employment status, or, if employed, industry or job classification if the individual is insured with that insurer and wishes to convert coverage to another policy, plan or contract. When offering benefits pursuant to this section, the insurer shall be required to offer equal or lesser benefits than the insured has under the existing policy or plan. If the insurer offers benefits in excess of what was included in the insurer’s contract to the insured, the insurer may impose health underwriting criteria and a preexisting condition clause which will waive all or a portion of benefits offered for the first twelve (12) months of the policy for a condition which has occurred during the preceding twelve (12) months. The preexisting condition clause herein authorized may not be applied to the transfer from one (1) medicare supplement policy, contract or certificate to another where benefits are increased. As used herein, \"benefits in excess of what was included in the insured’s contract\" shall include but not be limited to lower deductibles, lower coinsurance or copayments or lower maximum out-of-pocket expenditure for health care. The addition of pharmacy cards to replace existing prescription drug benefits, supplemental accident insurance, chiropractic services or vision services shall not constitute \"benefits in excess of what was included in the insured’s contract.\"\n\nIn implementing the provisions of this section, the director shall provide that insurers shall provide insureds with a simplified application that shall not exceed one (1) page in length and which shall not exceed six (6) medical questions.\n\n[(41-2146) added 1994, ch. 404, sec. 1, p. 1148; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 254, sec. 1, p. 832.]",
