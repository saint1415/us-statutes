If dependents are included in the coverage, only one (1) certificate need be issued for each family unit.\n\n(3) A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.\n\n(4) A provision that, a policy delivered or issued for delivery in this state more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of this act under which coverage of a dependent of a member of an insured group terminates at a specified age shall, with respect to an unmarried child who is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of intellectual disability or physical disability and who became so incapable prior to attainment of the limiting age and who is chiefly dependent upon such member for support and maintenance, not so terminate while the policy remains in force and the dependent remains in such condition, if the member has within thirty-one (31) days of such dependent’s attainment of the limiting age submitted proof of such dependent’s incapacity as described herein.

Failure to give notice within such time shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.\n\n(3) A provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss. If such forms are not furnished before the expiration of fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice, the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character and extent of the loss for which claim is made.\n\n(4) A provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of such loss must be furnished to the insurer within thirty (30) days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of such disability must be furnished to the insurer at such intervals as the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of such loss must be furnished to the insurer within ninety (90) days after the date of such loss.

(1) Any group disability insurance contract or blanket disability insurance contract, delivered or issued for delivery in this state which provides coverage for injury or sickness for newborn dependent children of subscribers or other members of the covered group, shall provide coverage for such newborn children, including adopted newborn children that are placed with the adoptive subscriber or other member of the covered group within sixty (60) days of the adopted child’s date of birth, from and after the moment of birth. Coverage under the contract for an adopted newborn child placed with the adoptive subscriber or other member of the covered group more than sixty (60) days after the birth of the adopted child shall be from and after the date the child is so placed. Coverage provided in accord with this section shall include, but not be limited to, coverage for congenital anomalies. For the purposes of this section, \"child\" means an individual who has not attained age eighteen (18) years as of the date of the adoption or placement for adoption. For the purposes of this section, \"placed\" shall mean physical placement in the care of the adoptive subscriber or other member of the covered group, or in those circumstances in which such physical placement is prevented due to the medical needs of the child requiring placement in a medical facility, it shall mean when the adoptive subscriber or other member of the covered group signs an agreement for adoption of such child and signs an agreement assuming financial responsibility for such child. Prior to legal finalization of adoption, the coverage required under the provisions of this subsection (1) as to a child placed for adoption with a subscriber or other member of the covered group continues in the same manner as it would with respect to a naturally born child of the subscriber or other member of the covered group until the first to occur of the following events:\n\n(a) Date the child is removed permanently from that placement and the legal obligation terminates; or\n\n(b) The date the subscriber or other member of the covered group rescinds, in writing, the agreement of adoption or agreement assuming financial responsibility.\n\n(2) An insurer shall not restrict coverage under a group disability insurance contract or a blanket disability insurance contract of any dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of a child at the time the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage under the plan.\n\n(3) Any new or renewing group disability insurance contract or blanket disability insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall provide that an unmarried child under the age of twenty-five (25) years and who receives more than one-half (1/2) of his financial support from the parent shall be permitted to remain on the parent’s or parents’ contract. Further, any unmarried child of any age who is medically certified as disabled and financially dependent upon the parent is permitted to remain on the parent’s or parents’ contract.\n\n(4) No policy of disability insurance which provides maternity benefits for a person covered continuously from conception shall be issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 1977, if it contains any exclusion, reduction, or other limitations as to coverage, deductibles, or coinsurance provisions, as to involuntary complications of pregnancy, unless such provisions apply generally to all benefits paid under the policy. If a fixed amount is specified in such policy for surgery, the fixed amounts for surgical procedures involving involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be commensurate with other fixed amounts payable for procedures of comparable difficulty and severity. In a case where a fixed amount is payable for maternity benefits, involuntary complications of pregnancy shall be deemed an illness and entitled to benefits otherwise provided by the policy. Where the policy contains a maternity deductible, the maternity deductible shall apply only to expenses resulting from normal delivery and cesarean section delivery; however, expenses for cesarean section delivery in excess of the deductible shall be treated as expenses for any other illness under the policy. This section shall apply to all disability policies except any group disability policy made subject to an applicable collective-bargaining agreement in effect before January 1, 1977.\n\nFor purposes of this section, involuntary complications of pregnancy shall include, but not be limited to, puerperal infection, eclampsia, cesarean section delivery, ectopic pregnancy, and toxemia.\n\nAll policies subject to this section and issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 1977, shall be construed to be in compliance with this section, and any provision in any such policy which is in conflict with this section shall be of no force or effect.\n\n(5) From and after January 1, 1998, no policy of disability insurance which provides medical expense maternity benefits, shall restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child in a manner that would be in conflict with the newborns’ and mothers’ health protection act of 1996.\n\n[41-2210, as added by 1974, ch. 66, sec. 3, p. 1146; am. 1976, ch. 113, sec. 2, p. 444; am. 1993, ch. 305, sec. 2, p. 1130; am. 1994, ch. 365, sec. 4, p. 1151; am. 1997, ch. 321, sec. 2, p. 950; am. 2008, ch. 296, sec. 1, p. 825; am. 2009, ch. 125, sec. 2, p. 392.]",
