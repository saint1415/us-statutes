(1) Upon the receipt of an application for registration and payment of the application fee, the secretary of state shall cause the application to be examined for conformity with this chapter.\n\n(2) The applicant shall provide any additional pertinent information requested by the secretary of state including a description of a design mark and may make, or authorize the secretary of state to make, such amendments to the application as may be reasonably requested by the secretary of state or deemed by the applicant to be advisable to respond to any rejection or objection.\n\n(3) The secretary of state may require the applicant to disclaim an unregisterable component of a mark otherwise registerable, and an applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark sought to be registered. No disclaimer shall prejudice or affect the applicant’s or registrant’s rights then existing or thereafter arising in the disclaimed matter, or the applicant’s or registrant’s rights of registration on another application if the disclaimed matter is distinctive of the applicant’s or registrant’s goods or services.\n\n(4) Amendments may be made by the secretary of state upon the application submitted by the applicant upon the applicant’s agreement, or the secretary of state may require a fresh application.\n\n(5) If the applicant is found not to be entitled to registration, the secretary of state shall advise the applicant thereof and of the reasons therefor. The applicant shall have a reasonable period of time specified by the secretary of state in which to reply or to amend the application, in which event the application shall then be reexamined. This procedure may be repeated until: (a) the secretary of state finally refuses registration of the mark; or (b) the applicant fails to reply or amend within the specified period, whereupon the application shall be deemed to have been abandoned.\n\n(6) If the secretary of state finally refuses registration of the mark, the applicant may appeal the denial of such registration to the district court in and for Ada county. The court may compel registration of the mark, but without cost to the secretary of state, on proof that all the statements in the application are true and that the mark is otherwise entitled to registration.\n\n(7) In the instance of applications concurrently being processed by the secretary of state which seek registration of the same or confusingly similar marks for the same or related goods or services, the secretary of state shall grant priority to the applications in order of filing. If a prior-filed application is granted a registration, the other application or applications shall then be rejected. Any rejected applicant may bring an action for cancellation of the registration upon grounds of prior or superior rights to the mark, in accordance with the provisions of section 48-509, Idaho Code.\n\n[48-504, added 1996, ch. 404, sec. 2, p. 1339; am. 2012, ch. 322, sec. 1, p. 881.]",

This act shall be in force and effect on July 1, 1996, but shall not affect any suit, proceeding or appeal then pending. All acts relating to marks and parts of any other acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed on the effective date of this act, provided that as to any application, suit, proceeding or appeal, and for that purpose only, pending at the time this act takes effect the repeal shall be deemed not to be effective until final determination of said pending application, suit, proceeding or appeal.\n\nThe intent of this act is to provide a system of state trademark registration and protection substantially consistent with the federal system of trademark registration and protection under the trademark act of 1946, as amended. To that end, the construction given the federal act should be examined as persuasive authority for interpreting and construing this act.\n\n[48-518, added 1996, ch. 404, sec. 2, p. 1345.]",
