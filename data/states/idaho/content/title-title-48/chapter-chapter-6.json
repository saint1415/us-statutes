The notice shall also advise the consumer that the consumer may change back to the previous carrier or select a new carrier by calling the previous carrier or the consumer’s preferred carrier. The notice shall also provide the consumer with a toll-free number to call for further information.\n\n(c) The notice shall be sent on or before the fifteenth day after the consumer enters into the telecommunications service agreement, or on or before the day the telecommunications provider first bills the consumer under the agreement, whichever is later.\n\n(d) The notice must be a separate document sent for the sole purpose of advising the consumer of his or her entering into a telecommunications service agreement.
