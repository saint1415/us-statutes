As a result, consumers often find themselves in collection actions for debts they were unaware of, from health care providers whom they do not recognize. Once in collections, current Idaho law enables excessive attorney’s fees and fails to provide judges with clear guidance to combat abuses of the collections process. This chapter shall govern the fair collection of debts owed to health care providers.\n\n[48-302, added 2020, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 426.]",

Upon an affirmative showing that the incurred costs, expenses, and fees are grossly disproportionate to the award amounts set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section, and that fees were incurred because of the patient’s willful attempt to avoid paying a bona fide debt, then the court may take into account the factors outlined in rule 54(e)(3) of the Idaho rules of civil procedure and may, in its discretion, award supplemental costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of law or agreement to the contrary, if a patient in a contested judgment is a prevailing party, then the patient shall be entitled to recover from a nonprevailing party all costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the patient in contesting the action, and the patient shall have no liability to any nonprevailing parties for any costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney’s fees and prejudgment interest incurred by a nonprevailing party.\n\n[48-305, added 2020, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 428; am. 2022, ch. 263, sec. 3, p. 847.]",
