If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall carry out, at the option of the consumer, the requirements under subsection (1)(a) or (b) or (2) of this section, whichever is appropriate.\n\n(1) To provide for refunds, at the request of the consumer, the manufacturer shall do one (1) of the following:\n\n(a) Accept return of the assistive device and refund to the consumer and to a holder of a perfected security interest in the consumer’s assistive device, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price plus any finance charge, amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale and collateral costs, less a reasonable allowance for use; or\n\n(b) Accept return of the assistive device, refund to the assistive device lessor and the holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive device, as their interest may appear, the current value of a written lease and refund to the consumer the amount that the consumer paid under the written lease plus collateral costs, less a reasonable allowance for use.\n\n(2) The manufacturer shall provide a comparable new assistive device replacing the device having the nonconformity. To receive a comparable new assistive device, the consumer shall offer to transfer possession of the assistive device to the manufacturer of the assistive device having the nonconformity. No later than thirty (30) days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with the comparable new assistive device or a refund, and the consumer shall return the assistive device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer, along with any endorsements necessary to transfer real possession to the manufacturer.\n\n(3) If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, an assistive device lessor shall receive a refund from the manufacturer. To receive a refund, the assistive device lessor shall offer to transfer possession of a nonconforming assistive device to its manufacturer. No later than thirty (30) days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the assistive device lessor. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the assistive device lessor shall provide to the manufacturer any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.\n\n(4) Under this section, the current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which that lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus the assistive device dealer’s early termination costs and the value of the assistive device at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the assistive device lessor’s early termination savings.\n\n(5) Under this section, a reasonable allowance for use may not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the total amount the consumer paid or for which the written lease obligates the consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which is one thousand eight hundred twenty-five (1,825) and the numerator of which is the number of days that the consumer used the assistive device before first reporting the nonconformity to the manufacturer, assistive device lessor or assistive device dealer.\n\n(6) No person may enforce the lease against the consumer after the consumer receives a refund.\n\n[48-1404, added 1997, ch. 276, sec. 1, p. 821.]",
