The commission may promulgate rules changing or eliminating the fee reduction.\n\n(3) Within ninety (90) days from the date of the notice of filing, the commission shall enter an order registering the subdivided lands or rejecting the registration. If no order of rejection is entered within ninety (90) days from the date of notice of filing, the land shall be deemed registered unless the applicant has consented in writing to a delay.\n\n(4) If the commission determines that the requirements of sections 55-1806 through 55-1808, Idaho Code, have been met, it shall enter an order registering the subdivided lands and shall designate the form of the public offering statement.\n\n(5) If the commission determines that any of the requirements of sections 55-1806 through 55-1808, Idaho Code, have not been met, the commission shall notify the applicant that the application for registration must be corrected in the particulars specified within ten (10) days or within the time otherwise allowed by the commission.

The order rejecting the registration shall not become effective for twenty (20) days after service of the order, during which time the applicant may make a written request for a hearing. If a hearing is not timely requested, the order shall become the final agency action subject to judicial review under chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) Registration under this chapter shall be effective as of the date of the registration order for a period of one (1) year and may be renewed for additional periods of one (1) year by filing, not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of a registration, a renewal application in such form and containing such information as the commission shall prescribe, including the renewal report provided in section 55-1810, Idaho Code, together with the payment of a base renewal fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250), plus one dollar ($1.00) for each lot, parcel, unit or interest.

A late renewal fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day will be charged for each day the renewal application is late, with a maximum late fee of five hundred dollars ($500). A registration that is not renewed within twenty (20) days of expiration shall be deemed canceled and may not thereafter be renewed under the provisions of this section. Each amendment to the original registration requires a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee.

All funds so deposited are hereby appropriated to the commission for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. All expenditures from said fund by the commission under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid out on warrants drawn by the state controller upon presentation of proper vouchers approved by the commission. Such claims and supporting vouchers shall be examined by the state board of examiners in the same manner as other claims against the state of Idaho. For the purpose of carrying out the objects of this chapter and in the exercise of the powers herein granted, the commission shall have powers to make orders concerning the disbursement of the moneys in said special real estate fund, including the payment of compensation and expenses of its members, clerks and employees and for the payment of printing and for such other expenses as deemed necessary.\n\n(8) The fact that an application for registration and public offering statement have been filed, or the fact that an order of registration has been issued, does not constitute a finding by the commission that any document is true, complete and not misleading, nor does either fact mean that the commission has determined in any way the merits, qualifications of or given its approval or recommendation to any person or subdivision.

If any amounts assessed against a subdivider by final order of the commission become otherwise uncollectible or payment is in default, and only if all of the defendant’s rights to appeal have passed, the commission may then proceed to district court and seek to enforce collection through judgment and execution, including an action against any bond filed or escrow or trust funds deposited pursuant to section 55-1806, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) Whenever it appears that a person has engaged or is about to engage in acts or practices that constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter or of a rule or order hereunder, the commission, with or without prior administrative proceedings, may bring an action in any district court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order hereunder. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order may be granted.\n\n(4) The commission may intervene in a suit involving subdivided lands. In any suit by or against a subdivider involving subdivided lands, the subdivider promptly shall furnish the commission notice of the suit and copies of all pleadings.\n\n(5) The commission may:\n\n(a) Accept registrations filed in other states or with the federal government;\n\n(b) Contract with the association of real estate license law officials to use its web-based file management system to accept registrations and related filings and to reduce the registration fees for applicants who use the web-based system to file registration documents;\n\n(c) Contract with similar agencies in this state or other jurisdictions to perform investigative functions.\n\n(6) The commission shall cooperate with similar agencies in other jurisdictions to establish uniform filing procedures and forms, uniform public offering statements, advertising standards, rules and common administrative practices.\n\n[55-1811, added 1972, ch. 276, sec. 11, p. 667; am. 2010, ch. 214, sec. 12, p. 476.]",
