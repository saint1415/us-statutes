Each condominium owner’s liability for claims, judgments or awards arising out of or in connection with the ownership, use, operation or management of the common areas, is limited to a proportionate sum which equals the amount of any such claim, judgment or award multiplied by the percentage interest in the common areas allocated to such ownership by the declaration as provided in section 55-1505(1)(c). In any suit to establish liability for claims, judgments or awards arising out of or in connection with the ownership, use, operation or management of the common areas there shall be introduced no evidence as to the percentage interest in the common area of any condominium owner until and unless such fact becomes material and liability is fixed by judgment or agreed upon in writing signed by all affected parties to the litigation and filed with the court. Any condominium owner may compromise or settle his portion of any such claim without prejudice to the remaining balance thereof and without the same constituting evidence or an admission for or against any such claimant.\n\nThe provisions of this section shall not alter or affect the respective rights and obligations of condominium owners to or between one another to the extent that one or more may have any legal right arising from contract, statute, or the common law to be wholly or partially indemnified by one or more other persons who are likewise owners of condominiums within the same said project.\n\n[55-1515, added 1965, ch. 225, sec. 15, p. 515.]",
