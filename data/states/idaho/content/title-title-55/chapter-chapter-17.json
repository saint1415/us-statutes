Such document shall also provide:\n\n(a) Identifying information of the prior system and the system translated to, together with a statement of the method of translation;\n\n(b) The type of transformation and parameters used and identifying information of the system translated to; or\n\n(c) Other metadata sufficient to translate coordinates between the original and destination systems.\n\n[55-1702, added 2021, ch. 174, sec. 5, p. 484.]",

The east x-coordinate shall give the distance east of the y-axis, and the north y-coordinate shall give the distance north of the x-axis. The y-axis of any zone shall be parallel with the central meridian of that zone. The x-axis of any zone shall be at right angles to the central meridian of that zone.\n\n(2) The coordinates described in subsection (1) of this section shall be made to depend upon and conform to the most recent system of plane coordinates, known as the SPCS and based upon the NSRS as maintained and provided by the NGS or its successors, provided such system has been adopted by administrative rule by the board.\n\n[55-1703, added 2021, ch. 174, sec. 7, p. 485.]",

(1) Whenever coordinates based on the IPCS are used to describe any boundary or right in real property, which in the same document or another document of record is also described by reference to any subdivision, line, or corner of the United States public land surveys or the lines or corners of a recorded subdivision, the description by coordinates shall be construed as supplemental to the basic description of such subdivision, line, or corner contained in the official plats and field notes of the United States public land surveys filed of record or in a recorded subdivision plat. In the event of any conflict, a description by reference to the subdivisions, lines, or corners of the United States public land surveys or lines and corners of a recorded subdivision shall prevail over any description by coordinates, unless said coordinates are upheld by adjudication, in which case the coordinate description shall prevail.\n\n(2) Every recorded map, survey, plat, conveyance, or other instrument affecting title to or rights in real property that delineates, describes, or refers to such property or any part thereof by reference to coordinates based upon the IPCS shall also describe the property by reference and tie to public land survey corners as defined in section 55-1603(11), Idaho Code, unless such property is within a recorded subdivision, in which case the property may be described by reference and tie to lines and corners within such subdivision.\n\n[55-1708, added 2021, ch. 174, sec. 14, p. 486.]",
