      "text": "49-2501. ENACTMENT OF COMPACT. The nonresident violator compact hereinafter called \"the compact\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nNONRESIDENT VIOLATOR COMPACT\n\nFindings and Declaration of Policy\n\n(1) The party jurisdictions find that:\n\n(a) In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date; or if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or is taken directly to court for his trial to be held. In some instances, the motorist’s driver’s license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation. The purpose of the practices described is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.\n\n(b) A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(c) The practice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.\n\n(d) The deposit of a driver’s license as a bail bond, as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, is viewed with disfavor.\n\n(e) The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\n(2) It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:\n\n(a) Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.\n\n(b) Allow motorists to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and proceed on their way without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued.\n\n(c) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.\n\n(d) Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.\n\n(3) The purpose of this compact is to:\n\n(a) Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (2) hereof in a uniform and orderly manner.\n\n(b) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist’s right of due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction.\n\nDefinitions\n\nAs used in this compact, the following words have the meaning indicated, unless the context requires otherwise:\n\n(1) \"Citation\" means any summons, ticket or other official document issued by a police officer for a traffic violation containing an order which requires the motorist to respond.\n\n(2) \"Collateral\" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, following the issuance by a police officer of a citation for a traffic violation.\n\n(3) \"Compliance\" means to appear in court or pay the fine and costs specified in the citation or to fulfill an obligation arising from any other option expressly stated upon the citation.\n\n(4) \"Court\" means a court of law or traffic tribunal.\n\n(5) \"Driver’s license\" means any license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of the home jurisdiction.\n\n(6) \"Home jurisdiction\" means the jurisdiction that issued the driver’s license of the traffic violator.\n\n(7) \"Issuing jurisdiction\" means the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist.\n\n(8) \"Jurisdiction\" means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, provinces of Canada or other countries.\n\n(9) \"Motorist\" means a driver of a motor vehicle operating in a party jurisdiction other than the home jurisdiction.\n\n(10) \"Personal recognizance\" means an agreement by a motorist made at the time of issuance of the traffic citation that he will comply with the terms of that traffic citation.\n\n(11) \"Police officer\" means any individual authorized by the party jurisdiction to issue a citation for a traffic violation.\n\n(12) \"Terms of the citation\" mean those options expressly stated upon the citation.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nProcedure for Issuing Jurisdiction\n\n(1) When issuing a citation for a traffic violation, a police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a driver’s license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in subsection (2) hereof, require the motorist to post collateral to secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist’s personal recognizance that he will comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(2) Personal recognizance is acceptable only if not prohibited by law. If mandatory appearance is required, it should take place immediately following issuance of the citation.\n\n(3) Upon failure of a motorist to comply with the terms of a traffic citation, the appropriate official shall report to the licensing authority of the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued of the failure to comply.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of the report, the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home jurisdiction of the motorist, the information in a form and content as contained in the compact manual.\n\n(5) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction need not suspend the privilege of a motorist for whom a report has been transmitted.\n\n(6) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of transmission is more than six (6) months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued.\n\n(7) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation where the date of issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of entry for the two (2) jurisdictions affected.\n\nProcedure for Home Jurisdiction\n\n(1) Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply from the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction, the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a suspension action, in accordance with the home jurisdiction’s procedures, to suspend the motorist’s driver’s license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the home jurisdiction licensing authority.\n\n(2) The licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing jurisdictions as provided in the compact manual.\n\nApplicability of Other Laws\n\nExcept as expressly required by the provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party jurisdiction to apply any of its other laws relating to license to drive to any person or circumstance, or to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangements between a party jurisdiction and a nonparty jurisdiction.\n\nCompact Administrator Procedures\n\n(1) For the purpose of administering the provisions of this compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, a board of compact administrators is established.
