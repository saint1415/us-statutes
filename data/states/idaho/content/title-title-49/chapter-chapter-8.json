Whenever a particular section does not state that traffic-control devices are required, the section shall be effective even though no devices are erected and in place.\n\n(3) Whenever traffic-control devices are placed or held in position approximately conforming to the requirements of this title, the devices shall be presumed to have been placed or held by the official act or direction of lawful authority, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.\n\n(4) Any traffic-control device placed or held pursuant to the provisions of this title and purporting to conform to the lawful requirement pertaining to those devices shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of this title, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.\n\n[49-801, added 1988, ch. 265, sec. 215, p. 681.]",

      "text": "49-802. TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for pedestrian-control signals and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:\n\n(1) Green indication:\n\n(a) A driver facing a circular green signal shall proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign prohibits a right or left turn. Any driver, including one turning, shall yield the right-of-way to other traffic and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection, as defined in section 49-110, Idaho Code, or an adjacent crosswalk.\n\n(b) A driver facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, shall enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the green arrow, or other movement that is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. A driver facing a left turn green arrow shall yield the right-of-way to other traffic and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.\n\n(c) A pedestrian facing a circular green signal, unless prohibited by a sign or otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in section 49-803, Idaho Code, may proceed across the highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, but shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that signal is first shown.\n\n(d) A pedestrian facing a green arrow turn signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in section 49-803, Idaho Code, shall not enter the highway.\n\n(2) Steady yellow indication:\n\n(a) A driver facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is being warned that the related green movement is ending, or that a red indication will be shown immediately after it.\n\n(b) A pedestrian facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in section 49-803, Idaho Code, is being warned that there is insufficient time to cross the highway.\n\n(3) Steady red indication:\n\n(a) A driver facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop before entering the intersection, as defined in section 49-110, Idaho Code, and shall remain stopped until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection. While stopped at the intersection, the driver shall remain stopped behind the marked limit line, as defined in section 49-113, Idaho Code, or if there is no marked limit line, shall not block the crosswalk.\n\n(b) Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, a driver after stopping, facing a steady circular red signal, may turn right, or turn left from a highway onto a one-way highway after stopping. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.\n\n(c) A driver facing a steady red arrow indication shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked limit line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain stopped until an indication permitting movement is shown.\n\n(d) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, a pedestrian facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal shall not enter the traffic lanes of a highway.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the driver of a motorcycle approaching an intersection that is controlled by a triggered traffic-control signal using a vehicle detection device that is inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle, shall come to a full and complete stop at the intersection. If the signal fails to operate after one cycle of the traffic signal, the driver may proceed after exercising due caution and care. It is not a defense to a violation of section 49-801, Idaho Code, that the driver of a motorcycle proceeded under the belief that a traffic-control signal used a vehicle detection device or was inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle when such signal did not use a vehicle detection device or that any such device was not in fact inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle.\n\n(4) When an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or crosswalk or limit line indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of a sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.\n\n[49-802, added 1988, ch. 265, sec. 216, p. 682; am. 1998, ch. 393, sec. 1, p. 1233; am. 2006, ch. 381, sec. 1, p. 1199.]",

A pedestrian facing the signal may proceed across the highway in the direction of the signal, but shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time the signal is first shown.\n\n(2) Flashing or Steady \"Don’t Walk\" or \"Wait\".
