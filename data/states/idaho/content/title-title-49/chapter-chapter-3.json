(1) No enrollee of any class D driver’s training course shall be allowed to attend classes or participate in driving instruction unless he has obtained a class D driver’s training instruction permit or a class D instruction permit as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\n\n(2) Every enrollee of a class D driver’s training course shall pay a nonrefundable fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00), except that a pupil who participates in parent-student on-road driver’s training pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall pay a nonrefundable fee of ten dollars ($10.00). Five dollars ($5.00) of each fee so imposed shall be deposited in the state highway account and five dollars ($5.00) shall be deposited in the county current expense fund. The additional five dollars ($5.00) for every class D driver’s training course enrollee shall be:\n\n(a) Deposited in the driver training account if the person is taking driver’s training from a public school; or\n\n(b) Paid to the division of occupational and professional licenses and deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the occupational licenses fund if the person is taking driver’s training from a private driver’s training program. The amount to be remitted to the division of occupational and professional licenses shall be annually calculated and paid. To calculate such amount, the total number of public driver’s training students as submitted to the state department of education shall be subtracted from the total number of permits sold as reported by the Idaho transportation department, and the resulting number shall be multiplied by five dollars ($5.00).\n\n(3) Each enrollee of a class D driver’s training course shall provide the type of information required for a driver’s license or instruction permit. If an enrollee of a class D driver’s training course cannot provide a certified copy of his birth certificate at the time of application for a permit, the department may issue a class D driver’s training instruction permit or a class D instruction permit upon receipt of identification acceptable to the department. The certified copy of an applicant’s birth certificate or another government-issued identity document and documentation to establish the applicant’s relationship to a person who is willing to assume responsibility for such applicant shall be required before a class D driver’s license will be issued.\n\n(4) The class D driver’s training instruction permit shall expire five (5) days after the permittee’s eighteenth birthday for permittees fourteen and one-half (14 1/2) years of age through seventeen and one-half (17 1/2) years of age. The class D driver’s training instruction permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issue for persons seventeen and one-half (17 1/2) years of age or older. Persons aged seventeen (17) years or older may attend classes or participate in driver’s training instruction while operating with a class D instruction permit or a class D driver’s training instruction permit.\n\n(5) The class D driver’s training instruction permit shall be issued to the instructor of the course or to the qualifying parent or legal guardian pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.\n\n(6)(a) An eligible student may satisfy the requirements of section 33-1702, Idaho Code, regarding driver’s training courses through parent-student on-road driver’s training pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, students eligible for driver’s training pursuant to section 33-1703, Idaho Code, may receive the in-car observation and behind-the-wheel instruction components of a driver’s training course from a qualifying parent or legal guardian instead of a licensed instructor only if the parent or legal guardian and the student live in a rural school district as described in section 33-319, Idaho Code, or in a school district that does not offer a driver’s training course.\n\n(b) A student participating in parent-student on-road driver’s training pursuant to this subsection shall enroll and successfully complete the thirty (30) hours of classroom instruction for driver’s training required under section 33-1702, Idaho Code, through the Idaho digital learning alliance online driver education course or through any other online driver’s training course approved by the state department of education. The Idaho digital learning alliance and any other approved online driver’s training program shall make online driver’s training courses available to all students eligible for driver’s training. The state department of education shall publish a list of all approved online driver’s training programs on the department’s website and such list shall also be made available at each county driver’s license office.\n\n(c) A parent or legal guardian who is qualified to provide parent-student on-road driver’s training pursuant to this subsection may teach the driving portion of a driver’s training course, including the six (6) hours of in-car observation and the six (6) hours of behind-the-wheel instruction required under section 33-1702, Idaho Code. Such training shall be done concurrently with the classroom component of the driver’s training course. The in-car observation and behind-the-wheel instruction components shall satisfy all content standards and benchmarks of the Idaho driver education curriculum approved by the state department of education.

Any person who applies for or receives any type of tax, welfare or other benefits or exemptions for the blind shall be presumed incompetent to operate a motor vehicle. This presumption can be overcome by any person whose vision can be corrected to a visual acuity of 20/40 or better in one (1) eye as documented by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist.\n\n3. Any person, department, or political subdivision of the state of Idaho who receives an application for any type of tax, welfare, aid or other benefits or exemptions for the blind shall immediately forward the name, address, sex, date of birth, and date of application of the applicant to the department.\n\n4. Any physician who has reason to believe that a patient is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle as defined in this subsection, may submit a report to the department. Before submitting a report, a physician should notify the patient or the patient’s family of the physician’s concerns about the patient’s ability to drive. If the physician submits a report, the physician shall provide a copy of the report to the patient or to a member of the patient’s family.

A value of one (1) point shall be given for a less serious violation and up to four (4) points for a more serious violation. Conviction or proof of infraction for only one (1) violation arising from one (1) occasion of arrest or citation shall be counted in determining the violation point count.\n\n(3) The department is authorized and directed to establish a violation point count system for various moving traffic violations and infractions occurring either within or without the state of Idaho, affecting all holders of driver’s licenses issued by the department.\n\n(4) Notification of suspension, revocation, cancellation or disqualification. Upon suspending, revoking, canceling or disqualifying the driver’s license or driving privileges of any person, the department shall immediately notify the applicant or licensee in writing, at the licensee’s address on file with the department pursuant to section 49-320, Idaho Code.

The application, eligibility requirements and form of the temporary restricted permit shall be provided by administrative rule. A temporary restricted permit may be issued to grant noncommercial driving privileges, but no temporary restricted permit shall be issued which grants driving privileges to operate a commercial motor vehicle.\n\n(5) The department shall not suspend or revoke a driver’s license or privileges for a period of more than one (1) year, unless otherwise provided by law. The provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable with respect to the issuance of temporary restricted permits as provided in section 49-325, Idaho Code, nor shall it be applicable to those suspensions placed on an individual’s record for the purpose of administering suspensions ordered to take effect after an individual’s release from confinement or imprisonment pursuant to chapter 80, title 18, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) The department shall not disqualify a driver for a period longer than specified by 49 CFR part 383.\n\n[49-326, added 1988, ch. 265, sec. 60, p. 601; am. 1989, ch. 88, sec. 38, p. 183; am. 1990, ch. 45, sec. 26, p. 99; am. 1992, ch. 115, sec. 18, p. 367; am. 1994, ch. 357, sec. 2, p. 1122; am. 1996, ch. 348, sec. 3, p. 1162; am. 1996, ch. 371, sec. 13, p. 1263; am. 1997, ch. 238, sec. 4, p. 696; am. 1998, ch. 110, sec. 26, p. 408; am. 1998, ch. 152, sec. 2, p. 523; am. 1999, ch. 81, sec. 13, p. 255; am. 2000, ch. 214, sec. 12, p. 600; am. 2004, ch. 126, sec. 6, p. 433; am. 2005, ch. 352, sec. 8, p. 1106; am. 2011, ch. 124, sec. 1, p. 348; am. 2013, ch. 129, sec. 1, p. 296.]",
