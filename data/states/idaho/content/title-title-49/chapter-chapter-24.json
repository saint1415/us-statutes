Persons whose department of homeland security documents do not state an expiration date shall be issued an identification card with an expiration date of one (1) year from the date of issuance.\n\n(8) When an identification card has been expired for less than twenty-five (25) months, the renewal of the identification card shall start from the original date of expiration, regardless of the year in which the application for renewal is made.

Such designation shall be made upon original issuance or renewal of an identification card. Designation shall also be made on any duplicate identification card issued, provided that the fee for such duplicate card is paid in accordance with this section.\n\n(14) Satisfactory proof of being a current or former member of the United States armed forces must be furnished by an applicant to the department before a designation of veteran status will be indicated on any identification card. Acceptable proof shall be a copy of form DD214 or an equivalent document or statement from the department of veterans affairs that identifies a character of service upon separation as \"honorable\" or \"general under honorable conditions.\"\n\n(15) In the case of a name change, the applicant shall provide legal documentation to verify the change in accordance with department rules.\n\n(16) Whenever any person, after applying for or receiving an identification card, moves from the address shown on the application or on the identification card issued, that person shall, within thirty (30) days, notify the transportation department in writing of the old and new addresses.\n\n(17) The department shall cancel any identification card upon determining that the person was not entitled to the issuance of the identification card or that the person failed to give the required and correct information in his application or committed fraud in making the application.
