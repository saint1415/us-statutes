      "text": "49-402C. SPECIAL LICENSE PLATE PROGRAMS — STANDARDIZED PLATE COLOR AND DESIGN. (1) It is the intent of the legislature that special license plates issued by the department be readily recognizable as plates from the state of Idaho without losing the uniqueness for which the special plate was designed and purchased. In addition, the legislature finds that the department can operate in a more efficient, cost-effective manner by conforming special plates to a basic color and design.\n\n(2) No special license plates and no special license plate programs in existence on or before June 30, 1998, shall be affected by the provisions of subsections (2) through (5) of this section. On and after July 1, 1998, any new special license plate program authorized or any redesign of an existing special license plate shall use the same red, white and blue background as the standard issue of license plates described in section 49-443, Idaho Code, except that:\n\n(a) The identification of county shall be omitted;\n\n(b) The word \"Idaho\" shall appear on every plate;\n\n(c) The inscription \"Scenic Idaho\" may be omitted without legislative consideration and approval; and\n\n(d) No slogan shall be used that infringes upon, dilutes or compromises, or could be perceived to infringe upon, dilute or compromise, the trademarks of the state of Idaho, including, but not limited to, \"Idaho Potatoes®,\" \"Grown in Idaho™,\" \"Famous Idaho Potatoes™\" or \"Famous Potatoes®.\"\n\nThe provisions of this section shall not apply to the plate designs issued pursuant to the provisions of section 49-417, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) Any redesign required for a special plate to conform with legislative intent and the provisions of this section may be done in a manner similar to that used to produce the original design.\n\n(4) The special plates shall conform in all other respects with the provisions of section 49-443, Idaho Code, relating to visibility requirements, display of registration number, time period for validity of plates, and reservation of plate numbers.\n\n(5) Unless otherwise specifically provided, no special license plates shall be issued to motor vehicles with a registered maximum gross weight in excess of twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds, or any motor vehicle registered under section 49-434(5), Idaho Code, or section 49-435, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, on and after July 1, 2020, no new special license plate or special license plate program shall be established for the benefit of any entity that is not the state of Idaho or an agency of the state of Idaho. With respect to any special license plate program that is in existence on July 1, 2020, that has a nonprofit agency as a recipient of the proceeds from the sales of such plate, if fewer than one thousand (1,000) plates are issued in the first year of the special plate program’s existence, fewer than one thousand five hundred (1,500) plates are issued in the second year of the special plate program’s existence, or fewer than two thousand (2,000) plates in the third or any subsequent year of such special plate program’s existence, the department shall discontinue that special license plate program.\n\n(7) With respect to a special license plate that has been discontinued prior to July 1, 2020, or is discontinued after that date for any reason, any existing plates may be renewed upon their expiration until the physical license plates must be replaced pursuant to section 49-443(2), Idaho Code. No duplicate or replacement plates will be produced if such plates are lost or damaged.\n\n[49-402C, added 1998, ch. 405, sec. 1, p. 1261; am. 1999, ch. 385, sec. 1, p. 1074; am. 2000, ch. 87, sec. 2, p. 191; am. 2002, ch. 285, sec. 2, p. 831; am. 2002, ch. 362, sec. 2, p. 1022; am. 2004, ch. 301, sec. 3, p. 843; am. 2014, ch. 38, sec. 6, p. 75; am. 2020, ch. 268, sec. 1, p. 778.]",

The provisions of this section shall not apply to any vehicle with a registered maximum gross weight over twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds. The number on the plates shall be the same combination of figures and letters that make up the radio call sign of the amateur radio operator.\n\n(2) The radio amateur license plate shall be of a color and design in accordance with the provisions of section 49-402C, Idaho Code. The distinguishing features of the license plate shall be:\n\n(a) A representation of a radio tower emitting radio waves in the form of lightning bolts with the phrase \"Amateur Radio\" beneath it;\n\n(b) The phrase \"CQ DE\" spelled out in international Morse code; and\n\n(c) The phrase \"Emergency Communication\" at the bottom of the plate and underneath the call sign.\n\n(3) The design and any slogan on the plate shall be acceptable to the Idaho section of the American radio relay league.

Initial costs of the plate program, including costs of plate design, shall be borne by the department.\n\n(4) Proof of holding an amateur license from the federal communications commission must be furnished to the department before the plates will be issued. Should the amateur’s radio license expire during any given year and not be renewed, the special license plates must be surrendered to the department and regular license plates obtained.\n\n(5) Radio amateurs will notify the department at a time to be set by the department of their intention to procure special license plates under the terms specified in this section. Failure to do so will result in the amateur being required to accept regular license plates should the department be unable to procure the special plates. Special plates may still be procured when available, but amateurs will be subject to the usual transfer fee.\n\n(6) Whenever an amateur transfers or assigns his title or interest to a vehicle especially registered, the registration shall expire but the amateur may hold his special license plates, which he may have reissued to him upon the payment of the required transfer fees. He may display the plates only after receipt of new registration from the department.\n\n(7) In addition to the regular registration fees required in section 49-402(1) or 49-434(1), Idaho Code, the applicant shall pay the plate fee specified in section 49-450, Idaho Code.\n\n[49-405, added 1988, ch. 265, sec. 74, p. 610; am. 1992, ch. 261, sec. 7, p. 763; am. 1994, ch. 278, sec. 1, p. 866; am. 1998, ch. 113, sec. 3, p. 419; am. 2000, ch. 87, sec. 7, p. 195; am. 2023, ch. 29, sec. 1, p. 147.]",

The license plate shall remain on the trailer or semitrailer until the registration is canceled or revoked. No part of the fee is subject to refund. However, the registrant may transfer the nonexpiring plate and registration to another trailer or semitrailer titled to the registrant if the original registration date is prior to July 1, 2009. The registration document shall be the official record of the status of the nonexpiring registration, and no registration fee shall be required after the initial registration is paid. No validation sticker shall be issued for license plates assigned under this section. The owner may be issued an electronic copy of the registration card issued pursuant to this section.\n\n(i) Registration of a trailer or semitrailer based in another jurisdiction may be issued when the registrant provides a valid jurisdiction title or ownership document and certification statement, and no title transfer will be required.\n\n(ii) Periodic verification will be made to confirm ownership status.

The manufacturer may issue the annual registration to foreign-based purchasers utilizing a manufacturer’s certificate of origin or manufacturer’s statement of origin as proof of ownership. If the foreign-based purchaser subsequently obtains an Idaho nonexpiring registration as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection prior to annual registration expiration, the amount of the annual registration fee shall be applied to the nonexpiring registration fee provided that the customer acquires a title for such vehicle.\n\n(c) For rental utility trailers, the registrant may prepay the annual registration for an additional one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4) years, but in no event shall the optional registration period extend beyond five (5) years. The fee shall be as specified in subsection (3)(b) or (c) of this section. The owner shall be issued a registration card or may request such card to be sent electronically. The expiration date shall be reflected on such registration card. The license plate shall become void if the owner’s interest in the rental utility trailer changes during the five (5) year period. If the owner fails to enter the rental utility trailer on the annual renewal application during the five (5) year period, the registration record shall be purged. Any unrenewed plate shall be returned to the department if it is not entered on the renewal application.\n\n(5) A fleet registration option is available to owners who have twenty-five (25) or more commercial or farm vehicles or any combination thereof. Such owners may register all of their company vehicles with the department in lieu of registering with a county assessor. To qualify, the fleet must be owned and operated under the unified control of one (1) person and the vehicles must be physically garaged and maintained in two (2) or more counties. Fleet registration shall not include fleets of rental vehicles. The department shall provide a registration application to the owner, and the owner shall provide all information that the department determines is necessary. The department shall devise a special license plate numbering system for fleet-registered vehicles as an alternative to county license plates. The fleet registration application and all subsequent registration renewals shall include the physical address where a vehicle is principally used, garaged and maintained. The fleet owner shall report the physical address to the department upon initial registration, on each renewal, and at any time a vehicle registered under this option is permanently transferred to another location.\n\n(6) If the ownership of a vehicle changes during the registration period, the original owner may transfer the plate to another vehicle. The remaining fee shall be credited against the cost of the new registration. Refunds may be given for any unexpired portion of the vehicle registration fee if the plate is not transferred by the owner to another vehicle. Any request for refund shall include surrender of the license plate and registration document, if a physical document was issued. Owners of vehicles registered under the international registration plan may request a refund of the unexpired portion of the Idaho vehicle registration fee by presenting evidence from the base jurisdiction that the license plate and registration document, if a physical document was issued, have been surrendered. A license plate shall not be transferred to another owner when the ownership of a vehicle changes. The owner shall obtain a replacement plate, if required, and a printed or electronic registration document when a plate is lost, destroyed, or becomes illegible.\n\n(7) An administrative fee of four dollars ($4.00) shall be paid and deposited to the state highway account on all registrations completed by the department under subsection (1) or (8)(a) of this section. Vehicles registered under subsection (8)(b) of this section shall pay the fee provided in section 49-435(2), Idaho Code.\n\n(8) There shall be paid on all commercial and farm vehicles having a maximum gross weight in excess of sixty thousand (60,000) pounds, a registration fee based upon the maximum gross weight of a vehicle as declared by the owner and the total number of miles driven on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho, and if registered under the international registration plan (IRP), in all other jurisdictions. The appropriate registration fee shall be determined as follows:\n\n(a) If the owner registers vehicles under the international registration plan (IRP), the appropriate mileage column shall be determined by the total miles an owner operated a fleet of vehicles on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho and in all other jurisdictions in the preceding year, as defined in section 49-117, Idaho Code, and by the maximum gross weight of each vehicle within a fleet.\n\n(b) If the owner registers vehicles under the international registration plan and determines that the average international registration plan fleet miles, calculated by dividing the total IRP fleet miles in all jurisdictions by the number of registered vehicles, is less than fifty thousand one (50,001) miles, the owner may apply to the department for refund of a portion of the registration fees paid, consistent with the fee schedules set forth in this section. The department shall provide an application for the refund. An owner making application for refund under this section shall be subject to auditing as provided in section 49-439, Idaho Code.\n\n(c) If the owner is not registering vehicles under the international registration plan, the appropriate mileage column shall be determined by the total miles the owner operated each of the vehicles to be registered on roads and highways in the state, county, city and highway district systems in Idaho in the preceding year and by the maximum gross weight of each vehicle.\n\nMaximum GrossWeight of Vehicle(Pounds)Total Miles Driven1 to7,501 to20,001 to35,001 toOver7,50020,00035,00050,00050,00060,001-62,000$223$ 511$ 789$1,068$1,56062,001-64,000$251$ 576$ 890$1,205$1,76064,001-66,000$280$ 642$ 992$1,342$1,96066,001-68,000$309$ 707$1,093$1,479$2,16068,001-70,000$337$ 773$1,194$1,615$2,36070,001-72,000$366$ 838$1,295$1,752$2,56072,001-74,000$394$ 904$1,396$1,889$2,76074,001-76,000$423$ 969$1,498$2,026$2,96076,001-78,000$451$1,035$1,599$2,163$3,16078,001-80,000$480$1,100$1,700$2,300$3,36080,001-82,000$494$1,133$1,751$2,368$3,46082,001-84,000$509$1,165$1,801$2,437$3,56084,001-86,000$523$1,198$1,852$2,505$3,66086,001-88,000$537$1,231$1,902$2,574$3,76088,001-90,000$551$1,264$1,953$2,642$3,86090,001-92,000$566$1,296$2,004$2,711$3,96092,001-94,000$580$1,329$2,054$2,779$4,06094,001-96,000$594$1,362$2,105$2,848$4,16096,001-98,000$609$1,395$2,155$2,916$4,26098,001-100,000$623$1,427$2,206$2,985$4,360100,001-102,000$637$1,460$2,257$3,053$4,460102,001-104,000$651$1,493$2,307$3,121$4,560104,001-106,000$666$1,526$2,358$3,190$4,660106,001-108,000$680$1,558$2,408$3,258$4,760108,001-110,000$694$1,591$2,459$3,327$4,860110,001-112,000$709$1,624$2,510$3,395$4,960112,001-114,000$723$1,657$2,560$3,464$5,060114,001-116,000$737$1,689$2,611$3,532$5,160116,001-118,000$751$1,722$2,661$3,601$5,260118,001-120,000$766$1,755$2,712$3,669$5,360120,001-122,000$780$1,788$2,763$3,738$5,460122,001-124,000$794$1,820$2,813$3,806$5,560124,001-126,000$809$1,853$2,864$3,874$5,660126,001-128,000$823$1,886$2,914$3,943$5,760128,001-129,000$837$1,918$2,965$4,011$5,860\n\nMaximum Gross\n\nWeight of Vehicle\n\nTotal Miles Driven\n\n60,001-62,000\n\n62,001-64,000\n\n64,001-66,000\n\n66,001-68,000\n\n68,001-70,000\n\n70,001-72,000\n\n72,001-74,000\n\n74,001-76,000\n\n76,001-78,000\n\n78,001-80,000\n\n80,001-82,000\n\n82,001-84,000\n\n84,001-86,000\n\n86,001-88,000\n\n88,001-90,000\n\n90,001-92,000\n\n92,001-94,000\n\n94,001-96,000\n\n96,001-98,000\n\n98,001-100,000\n\n100,001-102,000\n\n102,001-104,000\n\n104,001-106,000\n\n106,001-108,000\n\n108,001-110,000\n\n110,001-112,000\n\n112,001-114,000\n\n114,001-116,000\n\n116,001-118,000\n\n118,001-120,000\n\n120,001-122,000\n\n122,001-124,000\n\n124,001-126,000\n\n126,001-128,000\n\n128,001-129,000\n\nIn addition to the registration fees provided for in this subsection, there shall be an additional registration fee imposed of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).\n\n(d) In addition to the fees set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this subsection, an owner or operator may purchase a temporary permit as provided in section 49-432(2), Idaho Code, for operation of a vehicle at a weight in excess of the current, valid, registered maximum gross vehicle weight.
