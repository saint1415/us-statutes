      "text": "23-1003. BREWERS’, DEALERS’ AND WHOLESALERS’ LICENSES. (a) Before any brewer shall manufacture or any dealer or wholesaler import or sell beer within the state of Idaho, such brewer shall apply to the director for a license. The application form shall be prescribed and furnished by the director and require that the applicant show that such brewer possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications of a licensee. To determine qualification for a license, the director shall cause an investigation that shall include a fingerprint-based criminal history check of the Idaho central criminal history database and the federal bureau of investigation criminal history database. Each person listed as an applicant on an initial application shall submit a full set of fingerprints and the fee to cover the cost of the criminal history background check with the application. The application shall also be accompanied by the required licensee fee; provided, that where the applicant is or will be within more than one (1) of the foregoing classifications, the applicant shall apply for each classification but shall pay only one (1) license fee, which shall be for the classification requiring the highest fee. If the director is satisfied that the applicant possesses the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for the license, the director shall issue a license for each classification applied for, subject to the restrictions and upon the conditions in this act specified, which license or licenses shall be at all times prominently displayed in the place of business of the licensee.\n\n(b) Each wholesaler shall, in addition to the application, file with the director a notice in writing signed by the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler stating the geographic territory within which the wholesaler will distribute beer to retailers. The territory will be agreed upon between the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler and may not be changed or modified without the consent of both the dealer or brewer and the wholesaler. Provided however, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a brewer or dealer from permitting more than one (1) distributor for the same geographic territory.\n\n(c) In the event that a wholesaler sells beer to a retailer who is located outside the geographical territory designated by that wholesaler on the notice provided for in subsection (b) of this section, the dealer or wholesaler who has designated the geographical territory in which the sale occurred may apply to a district court of this state for the issuance of an injunction enjoining sales of beer by the wholesaler outside of its designated geographical territory. The procedure for issuance of an injunction pursuant to this act shall be subject to the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Upon proof to the court that a wholesaler has made a sale of beer outside of its designated geographical territory, the court shall issue an injunction directed to the wholesaler prohibiting sales of beer outside of its designated geographical territory.\n\n(d) Any licensed brewer that produces fewer than thirty thousand (30,000) barrels of beer in the aggregate annually, including any beer produced outside the state of Idaho, may be issued a brewer’s retail license. Upon payment of a retailer’s annual license fee, and subject to the fees in sections 23-1015 and 23-1016, Idaho Code, a brewer may, at its licensed brewery or at one (1) remote retail location, or both, sell at retail the products of any brewery by the individual bottle, can or glass. Any brewer selling beer at retail or selling products of its brewery to a retailer must pay the taxes required in section 23-1008, Idaho Code, on the products of its brewery, but need not be licensed as a wholesaler for the purpose of selling beer at the brewery or at one (1) remote retail location. Upon annual approval by the director, a brewer licensed pursuant to this subsection shall not forfeit its right to sell the products of any brewery by the individual bottle, can, or glass at its licensed brewery or one (1) remote retail location, or both, should the brewer produce more than thirty thousand (30,000) barrels of beer, provided such brewer:\n\n(1) Has continuously brewed beer in and continuously maintained a physical presence in the state of Idaho for no less than five (5) years;\n\n(2) Has not violated any of the provisions of this chapter resulting in a revocation or suspension of a license for multiple days during any point of the brewery’s production operations; and\n\n(3) Has surrendered any wholesale license.\n\n(e) A brewer that produces fewer than thirty thousand (30,000) barrels of beer in the aggregate annually, including any beer produced outside the state of Idaho, may be licensed as a wholesaler for the sale of beer produced by such brewery. Such brewer shall maintain a warehouse physically located within the state of Idaho, distribute its beer using employees of the brewery with equipment owned or controlled by the brewery, and comply with and be subject to all other regulations or provisions of law that apply to a wholesaler’s license, except as the laws may restrict sales at the licensed brewery or one (1) other remote retail location in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. The holder of a brewer’s retail license shall not be disqualified from holding a retail wine license or wine by the drink license for the sale of wine at the brewery’s premises on the grounds that the licensee is also licensed as a wholesaler.\n\n[23-1003, added 1935, ch. 132, sec. 3, as added by 1943, ch. 167, sec. 2, p. 349; am. 1972, ch. 370, sec. 1, p. 1087; am. 1974, ch. 27, sec. 42, p. 811; am. 1987, ch. 22, sec. 1, p. 29; am. 1989, ch. 290, sec. 1, p. 717; am. 2001, ch. 284, sec. 2, p. 1015; am. 2013, ch. 187, sec. 2, p. 449; am. 2014, ch. 97, sec. 5, p. 269; am. 2015, ch. 220, sec. 2, p. 683; am. 2024, ch. 279, sec. 1, p. 957; am. 2025, ch. 112, sec. 2, p. 597.]",

The application shall be on a form prescribed by the director that shall require such information concerning the applicant, the premises for which license is sought and the business to be conducted thereon by the applicant as the director may deem necessary or advisable, and which shall enable the director to determine that the applicant is eligible and has none of the disqualifications for license, as provided for in this section.

Such information shall include the following:\n\n(a) The name and place of residence of the applicant and length of his residence within the state of Idaho and, if the applicant is a partnership, the names, places of residence and lengths of residence within the state of Idaho of each partner and, if the applicant is a corporation or association, the date and place of incorporation or organization, the location of its principal place of business in Idaho and the names and places of residence of its officers, directors or members of its governing board and of the person who manages or will manage the business of selling beer at retail;\n\n(b) The particular place for which the license is desired, designating the same by a street and number, if practicable, or by such other apt description as definitely locates such place, and the name of the owner of the premises for which license is sought;\n\n(2) The application shall affirmatively show:\n\n(a) That the applicant is the bona fide owner of the business that will be engaged in the sale of beer at retail and with respect to which license is sought;\n\n(b) That the condition of the place or building wherein it is proposed to sell beer at retail conforms to all laws and rules of the state of Idaho and to the ordinances of the county and municipality applicable thereto relating to public health and safety and to the zoning ordinances of the municipality applicable thereto;\n\n(c) That there is no stamp or permit outstanding and in force that has been issued to any person by the United States government for the premises for which license to sell beer at retail is sought, which stamp or permit denotes payment of any special tax imposed by the United States government on a retail dealer in liquor or wines, unless said premises are premises for which a retail license for sale of liquor by the drink, issued under the provisions of chapter 9, title 23, Idaho Code, is in force and effect;\n\n(d) That the individual applicant, or each partner of a partnership applicant, or a corporation applicant or an association applicant is qualified to do business within the state of Idaho;\n\n(e) That the applicant, if an individual, is not less than nineteen (19) years of age;\n\n(f) That, within three (3) years immediately preceding the date of filing the application, the applicant has not been convicted of the violation of any law of the state of Idaho, any other state, or of the United States regulating, governing or prohibiting the sale, manufacture, transportation or possession of alcoholic beverages or intoxicating liquors, or, within said time, suffered the forfeiture of a bond for failure to appear in answer to charges of any such violation;\n\n(g) That, within five (5) years immediately preceding the date of filing the application, the applicant has not been convicted of any felony or paid any fine or completed any sentence of confinement therefor within said time;\n\n(h) That, within three (3) years next preceding the date of filing said application, the applicant has not had any license provided for herein, or any license or permit issued to the applicant pursuant to the law of this state, or any other state, or of the United States to sell, manufacture, transport or possess alcoholic beverages or intoxicating liquors, revoked.\n\n(3) To determine qualification for a license, the director shall also cause an investigation that shall include a fingerprint-based criminal history check of the Idaho central criminal history database and the federal bureau of investigation criminal history database. Each person listed as an applicant on an initial application shall submit a full set of fingerprints and the fee to cover the cost of the criminal history background check for such person with the application.\n\n(4) The affirmative showing required with respect to an applicant under paragraphs (e), (f), (g) and (h) of subsection (2) of this section shall also be required to be made with respect to each partner of a partnership applicant and to each incumbent officer, director or member of the governing board of a corporation or association applicant.\n\n(5) The application must be subscribed and sworn to by the individual applicant, or by a partner of a partnership applicant, or by an officer or manager of a corporation or association applicant, before a notary public or other person authorized by law to administer oaths.\n\n(6) If an applicant shall be unable to make any affirmative showing required in this section or if an application shall contain a false material statement, knowingly made, the same shall constitute a disqualification for license and license shall be refused. If license is received on any application containing a false material statement, knowingly made, such license shall be revoked. If at any time during the period for which license is issued, a licensee becomes unable to make the affirmative showings required by this section, license shall be revoked, or, if disqualification can be removed, the license shall be suspended until the same shall be removed. The procedure to be followed upon refusal, revocation or suspension of license as herein provided for shall be in accordance with the procedure set forth in this act.\n\n(7) All licenses shall expire at 1:00 a.m. on the first day of the renewal month, which shall be determined by the director by administrative rule and shall be subject to annual renewal upon proper application. The director will determine the renewal month by county based on the number of current licenses within each county, distributing renewals throughout the licensing year. The director may adjust the renewal month to accommodate population increases. Each licensee will be issued a temporary license to operate until the renewal month has been determined. Thereafter, renewals will occur annually on their renewal month. Renewal applications for licenses accompanied by the required fee must be filed with the director on or before the first day of the designated renewal month. Any licensee holding a valid license who fails to file an application for renewal of the current license on or before the first day of the designated renewal month shall have a grace period of an additional thirty-one (31) days in which to file an application for renewal of the license. The licensee shall not be permitted to sell beer at retail during the thirty-one (31) day extended time period unless and until the license is renewed.\n\n[23-1010, added 1961, ch. 299, sec. 2, p. 543; am. 1972, ch. 332, sec. 4, p. 834; am. 1974, ch. 27, sec. 45, p. 811; am. 1976, ch. 156, sec. 1, p. 555; am. 1978, ch. 304, sec. 1, p. 762; am. 1981, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 78; am. 1983, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 458; am. 1992, ch. 315, sec. 3, p. 939; am. 1994, ch. 14, sec. 6, p. 25; am. 2001, ch. 30, sec. 2, p. 45; am. 2001, ch. 284, sec. 3, p. 1017; am. 2003, ch. 111, sec. 4, p. 352; am. 2019, ch. 87, sec. 2, p. 213; am. 2025, ch. 189, sec. 2, p. 882.]",
