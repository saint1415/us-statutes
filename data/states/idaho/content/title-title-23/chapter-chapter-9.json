Any license issued that has remained in effect at its location for a consecutive period of ten (10) years or more shall be deemed to have been validly issued and may be renewed from year to year, provided that the applicant for the renewal of such license is not otherwise disqualified for licensure pursuant to section 23-910, Idaho Code, and, if the premises required special characteristics for original licensure, other than being either within or without the incorporated limits of a city, that said premises continue to have such special characteristics at the time of the application for renewal.\n\n(2) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the issuance of a license to the owner, operator, or lessee of an actual bona fide golf course whether located within or without the limits of any city, or located on premises also operated as a winery or ski resort, or to the lessee of any premises situate thereon, whether located within or without the limits of any city.
