The petition must be perfected within sixty (60) days of the date that the clerk finds the petition defective for lack of certified signatures. If the petition is not perfected within the sixty (60) day period, the clerk shall declare the petition null and void ab initio in its entirety.\n\n(h) In the event the county clerk shall certify to the board of county commissioners that a petition contains the required number of signatures of registered, qualified electors, said governing body shall forthwith make an order calling an election to be held, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, within said county in the manner provided by law for holding elections for county officers.\n\nIn addition to the other requirements of law, the notice of election shall notify the electors of the issue to be voted upon at said election.

The signer of any such petition may have his name removed from the petition at any time after the petition has been filed, but prior to the time when an election has been ordered, by presenting or submitting to the county clerk a signed, acknowledged statement that the signer desires to have his name removed from the petition. The statement shall contain sufficient information to clearly identify the signer. The county clerk shall immediately strike the signer’s name from the petition, and adjust the total of certified signatures on the petition accordingly. The statement shall be attached to, and become a part of, the petition.\n\nA person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary, not to exceed two (2) years, who:\n\n(a) Signs any name other than his own to any petition.\n\n(b) Knowingly signs his name more than once on the same petition.\n\n(c) Willfully or knowingly circulates, publishes or exhibits any false statement or representation concerning the contents, purport or effect of any petition for the purpose of obtaining any signature to any such petition, or for the purpose of persuading any person to sign any such petition.\n\n(d) Circulates or causes to circulate any petition, knowing the same to contain false, forged or fictitious names.\n\n(e) Makes any false affidavit concerning any petition or the signatures appended thereto.\n\n(f) Knowingly makes any false return, certification or affidavit concerning any petition or the signatures appended thereto.\n\n(g) Threatens any person with punitive or retaliatory action for the purpose of obtaining signatures or hindering or delaying the obtaining of signatures upon a petition.\n\n[23-1304, added 1971, ch. 156, sec. 4, p. 760; am. 1973, ch. 142, sec. 1, p. 273; am. 1974, ch. 27, sec. 63, p. 811; am. 1995, ch. 118, sec. 13, p. 440; am. 2003, ch. 119, sec. 2, p. 364.]",

(1) The director may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a retail wine license, wine by the drink license, wine distributor’s license, wine importer’s license, winery license, bonded wine warehouse license, wine direct shipper’s permit or vintner’s license issued pursuant to the terms of this chapter for any violation of or failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or rules and regulations promulgated by the director or the state tax commission pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter. Manufacturing or bottling functions of a winery shall not be subject to suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of a license, except for violations of law directly related to the manufacturing or bottling activities of the winery. Procedures for the suspension, revocation or refusal to grant or renew licenses issued under this chapter shall be in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) When the director determines to suspend such license, the affected licensee may petition the director prior to the effective date of the suspension requesting that a monetary payment be allowed in lieu of the license suspension. If the director determines such payment to be consistent with the purpose of the laws of the state of Idaho and is in the public interest, he shall establish a monetary payment in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). The licensee may reject the payment amount determined by the director, and instead be subject to the suspension provisions of subsection (1) of this section. Upon payment of the amount established, the director shall cancel the suspension period. The director shall cause any payment to be paid to the treasurer of the state of Idaho for credit to the state’s general account in the state operating fund.\n\n(3) The suspension of a license for the sale of liquor or beer shall automatically result in the suspension of any license for the sale of wine held by the same licensee and issued for the same premises or location. Such additional suspension shall be equal in length to and run concurrently with the period of the original suspension.\n\n(4) When a proceeding to revoke or suspend a license has been or is about to be instituted during the time a renewal application of such license is pending before the director, the director shall renew the license notwithstanding the pending proceedings, but such renewed license may be revoked or suspended without hearing if and when the previous license is, for any reason, revoked or suspended.\n\n[23-1331, added 1971, ch. 156, sec. 31, p. 760; am. 1973, ch. 144, sec. 8, p. 281; am. 1974, ch. 27, sec. 74, p. 811; am. 1979, ch. 145, sec. 3, p. 445; am. 1980, ch. 221, sec. 1, p. 493; am. 1981, ch. 199, sec. 3, p. 352; am. 1984, ch. 221, sec. 13, p. 538; am. 1991, ch. 50, sec. 3, p. 93; am. 1993, ch. 347, sec. 3, p. 1292; am. 2014, ch. 122, sec. 1, p. 352; am. 2017, ch. 31, sec. 1, p. 52; am. 2020, ch. 10, sec. 8, p. 16.]",
