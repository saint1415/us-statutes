Provided nothing in this subsection shall apply where the headlights of a motor vehicle, operated and proceeding in a normal manner on any highway or roadway, cast a light upon animals or birds on or adjacent to such highway or roadway and there is no intent or attempt to locate such animals or birds. Provided further, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the hunting of unprotected or predatory wildlife with the aid of artificial light when such hunting is for the purpose of protecting property or livestock, is done by landowners or persons authorized in writing by them to do so and is done on property they own, lease or control; and provided further that the hunting and taking of unprotected or predatory wildlife with the aid of artificial light on public lands is authorized after obtaining a permit to do so from the director.

Except for antelope, elk, deer or moose when any other wildlife, protected by this title, is doing damage to or is destroying any property, including water rights, or is likely to do so, the owner or lessee thereof may make complaint and report the facts to the director or his designee who shall investigate the conditions complained of. In the case of water rights, the director shall request an investigation by the director of the department of water resources of the conditions complained of. The director of the department of water resources shall request a recommendation from the local water master, if any and, upon such examination, shall certify to the director of the department of fish and game whether said wildlife, or houses, dams or other structures erected by said wildlife, is injuring or otherwise adversely impacting water rights. If it appears that the complaint is well-founded and the property of such complainant is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed by any such wildlife protected under this title, the director may:\n\n1. Send a representative onto the premises to control, trap, and/or remove such protected wildlife as will stop the damage to said property. Any animals or birds so taken shall remain the property of the state and shall be turned over to the director.\n\n2.

Issue a permit to any bona fide owner or lessee of property that is being actually and materially damaged by furbearing animals, to trap or kill or to have trapped or killed such animals on his own or leased premises. Such permit may be issued without cost to a landholder applicant and shall designate therein the number of furbearing animals that may be trapped or killed, the name of the person who the landowner has designated to take such furbearers and the valid trapping license number of the taker. Furbearers so taken shall be the property of the taker. The term \"premises\" shall be construed to include any irrigation ditch or right-of-way appurtenant to the land for which said permit is issued.\n\n(b) Control of Depredation of Black Bear, Mountain Lion, and Predators. Black bear, mountain lion, and predators may be disposed of by livestock owners, their employees, agents and animal damage control personnel when same are molesting or attacking livestock and it shall not be necessary to obtain any permit from the department.

The wolf depredation control board shall be authorized to renew such permits or transfer such permits to a different contracting party. Control is also permitted by owners, their employees and agents pursuant to the Idaho department of fish and game harvest rules. For the purposes of this subsection, \"molesting\" means the actions of a wolf that are annoying, disturbing or persecuting, especially with hostile intent or injurious effect, or chasing, driving, flushing, worrying, following after or on the trail of, or stalking or lying in wait for, livestock or domestic animals.\n\n(d) Control of Depredation of Wolves on Wildlife Populations.

(a) Prevention of depredation shall be a priority management objective of the department, and it is the obligation of landowners to take all reasonable steps to prevent property loss from wildlife or to mitigate damages by wildlife. When any pronghorn antelope, elk, deer or moose is doing damage to or is destroying any property or is about to do so, the owner or lessee thereof may make complaint and verbally or electronically report the facts to the director or his designee who shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, investigate the conditions complained of.

The agreement made under the provisions of this subsection may provide for financial compensation to the owner or lessee. If made, financial compensation under the provisions of this subsection shall be governed by the provisions of section 36-115, Idaho Code, and shall not be in addition to any payments for the same crop losses from any other source. Compensation for damages under the provisions of this subsection shall be available for damages done to private lands, whether owned or leased, if the owner or lessee allowed hunters reasonable access to the property or through the property to public lands for hunting purposes during the preceding hunting season or as a measure of response to depredation. This provision shall not negate the provisions of section 36-1603, Idaho Code, relating to the necessity of obtaining permission to enter private land. If necessary, the arbitration panel provided for in subsection (b) of this section shall determine the reasonableness of access allowed.\n\n(b) 1. In order to establish eligibility for submission of claims for damages, persons suffering crop, prepared seedbed ground, or irrigation equipment damages on privately owned or leased land caused by pronghorn antelope, elk, deer or moose must:\n\n(A) Notify the department within seventy-two (72) hours of discovery of damage.\n\n(B) Follow up verbal notification with a written, which may be electronic, notice within twenty (20) days of the discovery of damages.\n\n(C) The department shall not be held liable or accountable for any damages occurring more than twenty (20) days prior to the initial notification of damage. However, the department may extend the period up to thirty (30) days under exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe owner or lessee must have allowed hunters reasonable access to the property or through the property to public lands for hunting purposes during the preceding hunting season or as a measure of response to depredation, provided such access does not impact on their operations, or the claim for damages may be disallowed. Compensation for crop, prepared seedbed ground, or irrigation equipment damages claims shall not be in addition to any payments for the same crop losses from any other source and shall not include fence or other types of property damage. While fences are not subject to claim for payment, the department is allowed to provide support and assistance, including provision of materials to design, construct, and maintain fences for control of depredation. The notice of damages caused must be in written form, shall be in the form of a claim for damages substantially the same as required by section 6-907, Idaho Code, shall be attested to by the claimant under oath, and the claim shall be at least seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The claim shall not be amended after it is filed, provided however, that a claimant may file an additional claim in the event additional damage occurs subsequent to filing the initial claim. The department shall prepare and make available suitable forms for notice and claim for damages. Claims may be submitted only for the fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) in which they occurred, with allowance for submission within the first sixty (60) days of the following fiscal year if the claim occurred within the last sixty (60) days of the previous fiscal year. Any person submitting a fraudulent claim shall be prosecuted for a felony as provided in section 18-2706, Idaho Code. For purposes of this subsection, crop damages shall mean damage to plants grown or stored for profit and exclude ornamental plants, and damage to prepared seedbed ground or irrigation equipment shall include necessary parts and documented labor.\n\n2. Upon receipt by the department, the department shall review the claim, and if approved, pay it as provided in section 36-115, Idaho Code, or order it paid as provided in section 36-115, Idaho Code. Failure on the part of the owner or lessee to allow on-site access for inspection and investigation of alleged losses shall void the claim for damages.\n\n3. In the event the owner or lessee and the department fail to agree on the amount of damages within fifteen (15) business days of the written claim, either party may elect to retain the services of an independent certified insurance adjuster licensed in the state of Idaho to view the affected property and determine the amount of damages. In the event the owner or lessee and the department fail to agree on the amount of damages and neither party elects to retain the services of an independent certified insurance adjuster, provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection shall apply. The independent certified adjuster shall complete his review and determination within twenty (20) days from the date he is retained, and will report his determination in writing by certified mail to the department and to the owner or lessee. Neither the owner or lessee, nor the department, shall disturb the affected property prior to review and determination by the independent insurance adjuster. Costs associated with the services of the independent insurance adjuster shall be divided equally between the owner or lessee and the department, subject to reapportionment of the costs by an arbitration panel pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection. If the department, or the owner or lessee rejects the determination of the adjuster, they shall notify the other party in writing of the rejection within five (5) business days of receipt of the adjuster’s determination. In the event that either party rejects the adjuster’s determination, the provisions of paragraph 4. of this subsection shall apply.\n\n4. Within five (5) business days of a rejection of an adjuster’s determination of damages or failure of the owner or lessee and the department to agree on damages when a certified insurance adjuster is not used, the director must convene an arbitration panel. To convene an arbitration panel, the director must, within five (5) business days, appoint the department’s representative and notify the landholder of the appointment. The landholder(s) shall, within the next five (5) business days following such notice from the department, appoint his representative and notify the department of the appointment. Within the next five (5) business days, the department representative and the landholder must mutually appoint the third arbitrator. The arbitration panel shall consist of three (3) members, as follows:\n\n(A) The director of the department of fish and game or his designee;\n\n(B) The owner or his designee, or the lessee or his designee;\n\n(C) One (1) member selected by the two (2) members above.\n\nThe panel shall convene within thirty (30) days of the selection of the third arbitrator, and render its decision within fourteen (14) days after the hearing. When convened, the arbitration panel shall have the same authority to make on-site inspections as the department. The owner or lessee shall be responsible for payment of the expenses of his appointee; the director shall pay the expenses of his appointee from the expendable big game depredation fund; and the expenses of the third member shall be a joint responsibility of the owner or lessee, and the department. Provided however, the panel is authorized to review the costs associated with retaining the independent insurance adjuster and to determine whether those costs should instead be borne solely by the owner or lessee, solely by the department, or be apportioned between the owner or lessee and the department. In cases where an independent insurance adjuster was used, the party electing to use the adjuster shall assume the insurance adjuster’s determination of damage as their estimate of damage. The panel shall consider the claim submitted by the owner or lessee, and the estimate of damages submitted by the department, and shall select one amount or the other as being the closest to the actual damages sustained by the claimant. The arbitration panel shall report its decision in writing to both the owner or lessee and to the department within ten (10) days of the decision, and the decision of the panel shall be binding on the owner or lessee and the department. The fish and game advisory committee shall develop guidelines to govern arbitration procedures in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(c) Any claim received by the department under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section must be processed by the department within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt. If the claim is approved for payment, payment must be made within forty-five (45) calendar days of such approval. Any damage claim determination by an independent insurance adjuster pursuant to subsection (b)3. of this section, accepted by the parties, must be paid by the department within forty-five (45) calendar days of the determination. If the claim is arbitrated, the arbitration must be completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of filing the claim for such damages.\n\n[36-1108, added 1990, ch. 370, sec. 6, p. 1015; am. 1994, ch. 218, sec. 1, p. 680; am. 2004, ch. 189, sec. 3, p. 593; am. 2005, ch. 403, sec. 4, p. 1374; am. 2017, ch. 195, sec. 8, p. 475; am. 2018, ch. 350, sec. 13, p. 839; am. 2019, ch. 72, sec. 1, p. 168.]",

(a) Prevention of depredation shall be a priority management objective of the department, and it is the obligation of landowners to take all reasonable steps to prevent property loss from black bears, grizzly bears or mountain lions or to mitigate damage by such. The director, or his representative, will consult with appropriate land management agencies and land users before transplanting or relocating any black bear, grizzly bear or mountain lion.\n\n(b) When any black bear, grizzly bear or mountain lion has done damage to or is destroying livestock on public, state, or private land, whether owned or leased, or when any black bear or grizzly bear has done damage to or is destroying berries, bees, beehives or honey on private land, the owner or his representative of such livestock shall, for the purposes of filing a claim, report such loss to a representative of the U.S. department of agriculture animal plant and health inspection services/animal damage control (APHIS/ADC) who shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, investigate the conditions complained of. For purposes of this section, livestock shall be defined as domestic cattle, sheep, and goats. For purposes of this section, grizzly bear shall be defined as any grizzly bear not protected by the federal endangered species act. If it appears that the complaint is well-founded and livestock, berries, bees, beehives or honey of the complainant has been damaged or destroyed by such black bear, grizzly bear or mountain lion, APHIS/ADC shall so inform the owner or his representative, in writing, of the extent of physical damage or destruction in question and of the option to appeal through the Idaho depredating wildlife appeals board, as provided in section 22-5501, Idaho Code. The owner shall provide the director or the department’s regional office with the APHIS/ADC or Idaho depredating wildlife appeals board determination of damages or destruction. The physical damages, without establishing a monetary value thereon, as determined by the APHIS/ADC representative or the Idaho depredating wildlife appeals board, if the determination is so appealed, shall be final and shall be binding upon the owner or his representative and on the department.\n\n(c) Any claim for damages must be in written form, shall be in the form of a claim for damages substantially the same as required in section 6-907, Idaho Code, shall be attested to by the claimant under oath, and the claim shall be for an amount of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000) in damages per occurrence. The department shall prepare and make available suitable forms for claims for damages. Claims may be submitted only for the fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) in which they occurred. Any person submitting a fraudulent claim shall be prosecuted for a felony as provided in section 18-2706, Idaho Code.\n\n1. Upon receipt by the department, the department shall review the claim, and if approved, pay it as provided in section 36-115, Idaho Code. Failure on the part of the owner or representative to allow on-site access shall negate the claim for damages.\n\n2. If the department accepts the claim for damages as submitted by the owner or his representative, the department may approve the claim for payment, or may make a counteroffer. If the owner or his representative rejects the department’s counteroffer, this rejection or refusal must be in writing and submitted within five (5) business days. The value of the damage or destruction will then be determined pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b)3. of section 36-1108, Idaho Code, and, in circumstances so provided for by the provisions of subsection (b)3. of section 36-1108, Idaho Code, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b)4. of section 36-1108, Idaho Code.

(a) Prevention of depredation shall be a priority management objective of the department, and it is the obligation of landowners to take all reasonable steps to prevent property loss from grazing wildlife on private lands, whether owned or leased, or to mitigate damage by such. When any grazing wildlife is doing damage to or is destroying forage on private lands, whether owned or leased, the owner or lessee thereof may make a complaint and verbally or electronically report the facts to the director or his designee who shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, investigate the conditions complained of. The director may respond pursuant to section 36-1108(a)1. and 2., Idaho Code.

The cost of the consultant shall be paid by the owner or lessee. After the initial complaint, it shall be the responsibility of both the department and the owner or lessee to jointly design and implement a mutually agreeable method of determining forage utilization and damage or loss due to wildlife, which may include use of exclosure cages or other devices.

(1) It is the intent of the legislature to provide compensation to livestock owners that have experienced depredation of livestock by grizzly bear and wolves.\n\n(2) The Idaho state department of agriculture, in consultation with the department of fish and game and the office of species conservation, is authorized to carry out the purposes of this section and has spending authority for compensation pursuant to this section to the extent of legislative appropriation. The depredation of livestock and prevention fund is hereby established in the state treasury. All expenditures from the fund will be paid according to rules promulgated by the Idaho state department of agriculture. Beginning on July 1, 2024, and each July 1 thereafter, the legislature shall appropriate two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($225,000) annually to the fund. One hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) of that amount shall be used annually to compensate confirmed claims for depredation, and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) of that amount shall be used annually for conflict prevention and the provision of information regarding deterrents that have proven effective as determined pursuant to rule as promulgated by the Idaho state department of agriculture. All claims shall be made to the office of species conservation on or before December 31 of each year. Confirmed claims for depredation shall be paid on a pro rata basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all confirmed claims in full, until such time as moneys in the fund are depleted. Any moneys in the fund after payment of confirmed claims shall then be paid to those livestock owners with probable claims for depredation on a pro rata basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all probable claims in full, until such moneys in the fund are depleted. Any moneys in the fund after payment of claims deemed probable shall then be paid to those livestock owners with claims reviewed and deemed possible on a pro rata basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all possible claims in full, until such moneys in the fund are depleted. Any moneys in the fund after possible depredation claims are paid shall be carried over to the next calendar year. Interest accruing on moneys in the fund shall be retained in the fund. Moneys shall be continuously appropriated to the fund, but the fund shall not exceed four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000).\n\n(3) Compensation for claims confirmed or deemed probable or possible shall be based on current fair market value as provided by the Idaho state department of agriculture. Any other compensation paid to a livestock owner for depredation shall be deducted from the fair market value prior to payment.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, \"livestock\" means cattle, sheep, goat, swine, poultry, bees, llamas, or equine animals used for food or in the production of food, fiber, feed, or other agriculture-based consumer products, domesticated game, or other nonplant life; such term shall not include aquatic animals.\n\n[36-1121, added 2024, ch. 51, sec. 1, p. 260; am. 2025, ch. 102, sec. 1, p. 548.]",
