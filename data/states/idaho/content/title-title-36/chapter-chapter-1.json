All wildlife, including all wild animals, wild birds, and fish, within the state of Idaho, is hereby declared to be the property of the state of Idaho. It shall be preserved, protected, perpetuated, and managed. It shall be only captured or taken at such times or places, under such conditions, or by such means, or in such manner, as will preserve, protect, and perpetuate such wildlife, and provide for the citizens of this state and, as by law permitted to others, continued supplies of such wildlife for hunting, fishing and trapping.\n\n(b) Commission to Administer Policy. Because conditions are changing and in changing affect the preservation, protection, and perpetuation of Idaho wildlife, the methods and means of administering and carrying out the state’s policy must be flexible and dependent on the ascertainment of facts which from time to time exist and fix the needs for regulation and control of fishing, hunting, trapping, and other activity relating to wildlife, and because it is inconvenient and impractical for the legislature of the state of Idaho to administer such policy, it shall be the authority, power and duty of the fish and game commission to administer and carry out the policy of the state in accordance with the provisions of the Idaho fish and game code. The commission is not authorized to change such policy but only to administer it.\n\n[36-103, added 1976, ch. 95, sec. 2, p. 317.]",

In addition to the regular annual meeting, to be held in January, said commission shall hold other regular quarterly meetings each year at such places within the state as the commission shall select for the transaction of business. Special meetings may be called at any time and place by the chairman or a majority of the members of the commission.

For the purpose of administering the policy as declared in section 36-103, Idaho Code, the commission is hereby authorized and empowered to:\n\n1. Investigate and find facts regarding the status of the state’s wildlife populations in order to give effect to the policy of the state hereinbefore announced.\n\n2. Hold hearings for the purpose of hearing testimony, considering evidence and determining the facts as to when the supply of any of the wildlife in this state will be injuriously affected by the taking thereof, or for the purpose of determining when an open season may be declared for the taking of wildlife. Whenever said commission determines that the supply of any particular species of wildlife is being, or will be, during any particular period of time, injuriously affected by depletion by permitting the same to be taken, or if it should find a longer or different season, or different bag limit should be adopted for the better protection thereof, or if it finds that an open season may be declared without endangering the supply thereof, then it shall make a rule or proclamation embodying its findings in respect to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by what means, what sex, and in what amounts and numbers the wildlife of this state may be taken.\n\n3. Whenever it finds it necessary for the preservation, protection, or management of any wildlife of this state, by reason of any act of God or any other sudden or unexpected emergency, declare by temporary rule or proclamation the existence of such necessity, and the cause thereof, and prescribe and designate all affected areas or streams, and close the same to hunting, angling or trapping, or impose such restrictions and conditions upon hunting, angling or trapping as said commission shall find to be necessary. Every such temporary rule shall be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n4. At any time it shall deem necessary for the proper management of wildlife on any game preserve in the state of Idaho, declare an open season in any game preserve as it deems appropriate.\n\n5. (A) Upon notice to the public, cause to be held pursuant to the provisions of section 36-104A, Idaho Code, a drawing giving to license holders, under the wildlife laws of this state, the privilege of drawing by lot for a controlled hunt permit or tag authorizing the person to whom issued to hunt, kill, or attempt to kill any species of wild animals or birds designated by the commission under such rules as it shall prescribe.\n\n(B) The commission may, under rules or proclamations as it may prescribe, authorize the director to issue additional controlled hunt permits or tags and collect fees therefor authorizing landowners of property valuable for habitat or propagation purposes of deer, elk, antelope, bear or turkey, or the landowner’s designated agent(s) to hunt deer, elk, antelope, bear or turkey in controlled hunts containing the eligible property owned by those landowners in units where any permits or tags for deer, elk, antelope, bear or turkey are limited.\n\n(C) A nonrefundable fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code, shall be charged each applicant for a controlled hunt permit or tag. Successful applicants for controlled hunt permits or tags shall be charged the fee as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code. Additionally, a fee may be charged for telephone and credit card orders in accordance with subsection (e)11. of section 36-106, Idaho Code. The department shall include a checkoff form to allow applicants to designate one dollar ($1.00) of such nonrefundable application fee for transmittal to the reward fund of citizens against poaching, inc., an Idaho nonprofit corporation. The net proceeds from the nonrefundable fee shall be deposited in the fish and game account and none of the net proceeds shall be used to purchase lands.\n\n(D) The commission may by rule establish procedures relating to the application for the purchase of controlled hunt bonus or preference points by sportsmen and the fee for such application shall be as specified in section 36-416, Idaho Code.\n\n6. Adopt rules pertaining to the importation, exportation, release, sale, possession or transportation into, within or from the state of Idaho of any species of live, native or exotic wildlife or any eggs thereof.\n\n7. Acquire for and on behalf of the state of Idaho, by purchase, condemnation, lease, agreement, gift, or other device, lands or waters suitable for the purposes hereinafter enumerated in this paragraph. Whenever the commission proposes to purchase a tract of land in excess of fifteen (15) acres, the commission shall notify the board of county commissioners of the county where this land is located of the intended action. The board of county commissioners shall have ten (10) days after official notification to notify the commission whether or not they desire the commission to hold a public hearing on the intended purchase in the county. The commission shall give serious consideration to all public input received at the public hearing before making a final decision on the proposed acquisition. Following any land purchase, the fish and game commission shall provide, upon request by the board of county commissioners, within one hundred twenty (120) days, a management plan for the area purchased that would address noxious weed control, fencing, water management and other important issues raised during the public hearing. When considering purchasing lands pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall first make a good faith attempt to obtain a conservation easement, as provided in chapter 21, title 55, Idaho Code, before it may begin proceedings to purchase, condemn or otherwise acquire such lands. If the attempt to acquire a conservation easement is unsuccessful and the commission then purchases, condemns or otherwise acquires the lands, the commission shall record in writing the reasons why the attempt at acquiring the conservation easement was unsuccessful and then file the same in its records and in a report to the joint finance-appropriations committee. The commission shall develop, operate, and maintain the lands, waters or conservation easements for said purposes, which are hereby declared a public use:\n\n(A) For fish hatcheries, nursery ponds, or game animal or game bird farms;\n\n(B) For game, bird, fish or fur-bearing animal restoration, propagation or protection;\n\n(C) For public hunting, fishing or trapping areas to provide places where the public may fish, hunt, or trap in accordance with the provisions of law, or the regulation of the commission;\n\n(D) For public shooting ranges to provide places where the public may engage in target shooting, training, and competition.\n\n(E) To extend and consolidate, by exchange, lands or waters suitable for said purposes.\n\n8.

In the event owners or lawful possessors of land have restricted the operation of motor-propelled vehicles upon their land, the commission, upon consultation with all other potentially affected landowners, and having held a public hearing, if requested by not less than ten (10) residents of any county in which the land is located, may enter into cooperative agreements with those owners or possessors to enforce those restrictions when the restrictions protect wildlife or wildlife habitat. Provided, however, the commission shall not enter into such agreements for lands that either lie outside or are not adjacent to any adjoining the proclaimed boundaries of the national forests in Idaho.\n\n(A) The landowners, with the assistance of the department, shall cause notice of the restrictions, including the effective date thereof, to be posted on the main traveled roads entering the areas to which the restrictions apply. Provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall allow the unlawful posting of signs or other information on or adjacent to public highways as defined in subsection (5) of section 40-109, Idaho Code.\n\n(B) Nothing in this section authorizes the establishment of any restrictions that impede normal forest or range management operations.\n\n(C) No person shall violate such restrictions on the use of motor-propelled vehicles or tear down or lay down any fencing or gates enclosing such a restricted area or remove, mutilate, damage or destroy any notices, signs or markers giving notice of such restrictions. The commission may promulgate rules to administer the restrictions and cooperative agreements addressed in this subsection.\n\n11.

Enter into agreements with cities, counties, recreation districts or other political subdivisions for the lease of lands or waters, in accordance with all other applicable laws, including applicable provisions of titles 42 and 43, Idaho Code, to cost-effectively provide recreational opportunities for taxpayers or residents of those local governments or political subdivisions.\n\n16. Adopt rules governing a mentored hunting program.\n\n17. Enter into agreements with and assist counties, cities, recreation districts, other political subdivisions, and nonprofit clubs or associations in locating or relocating shooting ranges.\n\n(c) Limitation on Powers. Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the commission to change any penalty prescribed by law for a violation of its provisions, or to change the amount of license fees or the authority conferred by licenses prescribed by law.\n\n(d) Organization of Work. The commission shall organize the department, in accordance with the provisions of title 67, Idaho Code, into administrative units as may be necessary to efficiently administer said department. All employees of the department except the director shall be selected and appointed by the director in conformance with the provisions of chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n[36-104, added 1976, ch. 95, sec. 2, p. 318; am. 1977, ch. 116, sec. 1, p. 249; am. 1986, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 149; am. 1986, ch. 288, sec. 1, p. 725; am. 1986, ch. 329, sec. 1, p. 810; am. 1987, ch. 159, sec. 1, p. 311; am. 1989, ch. 316, sec. 1, p. 812; am. 1989, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 937; am. 1990, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1023; am. 1992, ch. 81, sec. 1, p. 222; am. 1993, ch. 197, sec. 1, p. 539; am. 1993, ch. 216, sec. 17, p. 599; am. 1994, ch. 82, sec. 1, p. 190; am. 1994, ch. 218, sec. 5, p. 687; am. 1995, ch. 64, sec. 1, p. 158; am. 1998, ch. 170, sec. 1, p. 568; am. 1999, ch. 372, sec. 1, p. 1016; am. 2000, ch. 211, sec. 1, p. 539; am. 2001, ch. 183, sec. 12, p. 621; am. 2002, ch. 224, sec. 1, p. 644; am. 2004, ch. 17, sec. 1, p. 16; am. 2009, ch. 201, sec. 1, p. 643; am. 2011, ch. 109, sec. 1, p. 280; am. 2014, ch. 104, sec. 1, p. 305; am. 2016, ch. 103, sec. 1, p. 300; am. 2020, ch. 85, sec. 1, p. 222.]",

Prior to any transplant or relocation of bighorn sheep into areas they do not now inhabit or a transplant or relocation for the purpose of augmenting existing populations, the department shall provide for any affected federal or state land grazing permittees or owners or leaseholders of private land a written agreement signed by all federal, state and private entities responsible for the transplant or relocation stating that the existing sheep or livestock operations in the area of any such bighorn sheep transplant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk, if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.\n\n(E) The Idaho department of fish and game: (1) shall develop a state management plan to maintain a viable, self-sustaining population of bighorn sheep in Idaho which shall consider as part of the plan the current federal or state domestic sheep grazing allotment(s) that currently have any bighorn sheep upon or in proximity to the allotment(s); (2) within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this act will cooperatively develop best management practices with the permittee(s) on the allotment(s). Upon commencement of the implementation of best management practices, the director shall certify that the risk of disease transmission, if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep is acceptable for the viability of the bighorn sheep. The director’s certification shall continue for as long as the best management practices are implemented. The director may also certify that the risk of disease transmission, if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep is acceptable for the viability of the bighorn sheep based upon a finding that other factors exist, including but not limited to previous exposure to pathogens that make separation between bighorn and domestic sheep unnecessary.\n\n6. (A) The director shall have the power, at any time when it is desired to introduce any new species, or if at any time any species of wildlife of the state of Idaho shall be threatened with excessive shooting, trapping, or angling or otherwise, to close any open season or to reduce the bag limit or possession limit for such species for such time as he may designate; in the event an emergency is declared to exist, such closure shall become effective forthwith upon written order of the director; in all other cases, upon publication and posting as provided in section 36-105, Idaho Code.\n\n(B) (i) In order to protect property from damage by wildlife, including bear and turkey, the fish and game commission may delegate to the director or his designee the authority to declare an open season upon that particular species of wildlife to reduce its population. The director or his designee shall make an order embodying his findings in respect to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by what means, and in what amounts, numbers and sex the wildlife subject to the hunt may be taken. In the event an emergency is declared to exist, such open season shall become effective forthwith upon written order of the director or his designee; in all other cases, upon publication and posting as provided in section 36-105, Idaho Code.\n\n(ii) In the event a kill permit is issued by the director or his designee, the individual or landowner with the kill permit, in conjunction with their responsibility for field dressing the animals taken, may keep one (1) animal for their personal use. In the event the director or his designee issues a subsequent kill permit for the same individual or landowner due to continued depredation, the director or his designee may authorize the individual or landowner to keep a second subsequently taken animal for their personal use.\n\n(C) Any season closure order issued under authority hereof shall be published in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the order for at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, and such order shall be posted in public places in each county as the director may direct.\n\n(D) During the closure of any open season or the opening of any special depredation season by the director, all provisions of laws relating to the closed season or the special depredation season on such wildlife shall be in force and whoever violates any of the provisions shall be subject to the penalties prescribed therefor.\n\n(E) Prior to the opening of any special depredation hunt, the director or his designee shall be authorized to provide up to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the available permits for such big game to the landholder(s) of privately owned land within the hunt area or his designees. If the landholder(s) chooses to designate hunters, he must provide a written list of the names of designated individuals to the department. If the landholder(s) fails to designate licensed hunters, then the department will issue the total available permits in the manner set by rule. All hunters must have a current hunting license and shall have equal access to both public and private lands within the hunt boundaries. It shall be unlawful for any landholder(s) to receive any form of compensation from a person who obtains or uses a depredation controlled hunt permit.\n\n7. The director shall make an annual report to the governor, the legislature, and the secretary of state of the doings and conditions of his office.\n\n8. The director may sell or cause to be sold publications and materials in accordance with section 59-1012, Idaho Code.\n\n9. Any deer, elk, antelope, moose, bighorn sheep or bison imported or transported by the department of fish and game shall be tested for the presence of certain communicable diseases that can be transmitted to domestic livestock. Those communicable diseases to be tested for shall be arrived at by mutual agreement between the department of fish and game and the department of agriculture. Any moneys expended by the department of fish and game on wildlife disease research shall be mutually agreed upon by the department of fish and game and the department of agriculture.\n\nIn addition, a comprehensive animal health program for all deer, elk, antelope, moose, bighorn sheep, or bison imported into, transported, or resident within the state of Idaho shall be implemented after said program is mutually agreed upon by the department of fish and game and the department of agriculture.\n\n10. In order to monitor and evaluate the disease status of wildlife and to protect Idaho’s livestock resources, any suspicion by fish and game personnel of a potential communicable disease process in wildlife shall be reported within twenty-four (24) hours to the department of agriculture. All samples collected for disease monitoring or disease evaluation of wildlife shall be submitted to the division of animal industries, department of agriculture.\n\n11. (A) The director is authorized to enter into an agreement with an independent contractor for the purpose of providing a telephone order and credit card payment service for controlled hunt permits, licenses, tags, and permits.\n\n(B) The contractor may collect a fee for its service in an amount to be set by contract.\n\n(C) All moneys collected for the telephone orders of such licenses, tags, and permits shall be and remain the property of the state, and such moneys shall be directly deposited by the contractor into the state treasurer’s account in accordance with the provisions of section 59-1014, Idaho Code. The contractor shall furnish a good and sufficient surety bond to the state of Idaho in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the telephone orders and potential refunds.\n\n(D) The refund of moneys for unsuccessful controlled hunt permit applications and licenses, tags, and permits approved by the department may be made by the contractor crediting the applicant’s or licensee’s credit card account.\n\n12. The director may define activities or facilities that primarily provide a benefit: to the department; to a person; for personal use; to a commercial enterprise; or for a commercial purpose.\n\n13. The director shall consult with other agencies to identify eligible land suitable for the location or relocation of shooting ranges.\n\n[36-106, added 1976, ch. 95, sec. 2, p. 321; am. 1983, ch. 59, sec. 2, p. 137; am. 1984, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 368; am. 1987, ch. 211, sec. 2, p. 445; am. 1988, ch. 260, sec. 1, p. 504; am. 1989, ch. 284, sec. 1, p. 695; am. 1990, ch. 9, sec. 1, p. 15; am. 1990, ch. 10, sec. 1, p. 18; am. 1993, ch. 309, sec. 1, p. 1140; am. 1994, ch. 82, sec. 2, p. 194; am. 1994, ch. 218, sec. 4, p. 684; am. 1997, ch. 284, sec. 1, p. 863; am. 1998, ch. 170, sec. 3, p. 572; am. 1999, ch. 370, sec. 22, p. 1002; am. 2000, ch. 211, sec. 2, p. 543; am. 2004, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 555; am. 2005, ch. 35, sec. 1, p. 151; am. 2009, ch. 314, sec. 1, p. 913; am. 2014, ch. 104, sec. 2, p. 308; am. 2017, ch. 199, sec. 1, p. 498; am. 2019, ch. 161, sec. 5, p. 529; am. 2020, ch. 85, sec. 2, p. 225.]",

This deductible is a net loss to the owner or lessee, and will not be compensated for from the expendable big game depredation fund, but the owner or lessee is required to absorb only a single seven hundred fifty dollar ($750) deductible per claim.\n\n(B) Provided however, that for claims in subsequent years for damage to standing or stored crops in the same location as the first occurrence, the seven hundred fifty dollar ($750) deductible will be waived if the department failed to prevent property loss following the first occurrence.\n\n3. Each approved claim must contain a certification by the director of the department of fish and game, or his designee, that:\n\n(A) All statutory requirements leading up to approval for payment have been met.\n\n(B) The claimant has certified that he will accept the amount approved as payment in full for the claim submitted, subject to the conditions and requirements of this subsection.\n\n(e) Any claim for damages pursuant to section 36-1109, Idaho Code, is limited by the following conditions and requirements:\n\n1. The full amount of any approved claim will not be paid at the time of approval, but shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements:\n\n(A) The director of the department of fish and game may order that not more than one-half (1/2) of the amount of the approved claim to be paid immediately, if, in the judgment of the director, such payment is within the estimated total claims liability for that fiscal year from the expendable big game depredation fund.\n\n(B) The total payment amount to any person for approved claims in the aggregate in a fiscal year, including any payment to any pass-through entity as defined in chapter 30, title 63, Idaho Code, from which the person receives income, and to any household member, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the original expendable big game depredation fund appropriation for the fiscal year.\n\n(C) The balance of all unpaid approved claim amounts shall be accumulated to a total as of June 30. If the balance in the expendable big game depredation fund appropriation is sufficient to pay all approved claims, the director shall promptly pay them. If the balance is not sufficient to pay the balance of all approved claims, the director shall pay a proportionate share to each claimant.\n\n(D) The director shall encumber the balance of the appropriation, or moneys sufficient to pay the approved claims, whichever is the lesser.\n\n2. Each claimant must submit a statement of total damages sustained per occurrence. For each such statement, the following condition applies: the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) must be deducted from each such statement. Provided however, if an owner or caretaker suffers damage to or destruction of livestock in more than one (1) occurrence during the fiscal year, then only one (1) deductible must be subtracted from the claims and the deductible on subsequent claims will be waived. This deductible is a net loss to the owner or caretaker, and will not be compensated for from the expendable big game depredation fund.\n\n3. Each approved claim must contain a certification by the director of the department of fish and game, or his designee, that:\n\n(A) All statutory requirements leading up to approval for payment have been met.\n\n(B) The claimant has certified that he will accept the amount approved as payment in full for the claim submitted, subject to the conditions and requirements of this subsection.\n\n(f) Any claim for damages to forage pursuant to section 36-1110, Idaho Code, is limited by the following conditions and requirements:\n\n1. The full amount of any approved claim will not be paid at the time of approval, but shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements:\n\n(A) The director of the department of fish and game may order not more than one-half (1/2) of the amount of the approved claim to be paid immediately, if, in the judgment of the director, such payment is within the estimated total claims liability for that fiscal year from the expendable big game depredation fund.\n\n(B) The balance of all unpaid approved claim amounts shall be accumulated to a total as of June 30. If the balance in the expendable big game depredation fund appropriation is sufficient to pay all approved claims, the director shall pay them. If the balance is not sufficient to pay all approved claims, the director shall authorize a proportionate amount to be paid to each claimant.\n\n(C) The director shall encumber the balance of the appropriation, or moneys sufficient to pay the approved claims, whichever is the lesser.\n\n2. Each claimant must submit a statement of total damages sustained per occurrence. For each such statement, the following conditions and requirements apply:\n\n(A) The amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) must be deducted from each such statement. This deductible is a net loss to the owner or lessee, and will not be compensated for from the expendable big game depredation fund.\n\n(B) The total amount of all claims for damages to forage that may be paid from the expendable big game depredation fund shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the amount of interest earned from investments of moneys in that fund in any one (1) fiscal year.\n\n3. Each approved claim must contain a certification by the director of the department of fish and game, or his designee, that:\n\n(A) All statutory requirements leading up to approval for payment have been met.\n\n(B) The claimant has certified that he will accept the amount approved as payment in full for the claim submitted, subject to the conditions and requirements of this subsection.\n\n[36-115, added 1990, ch. 370, sec. 3, p. 1010; am. 1994, ch. 180, sec. 60, p. 466; am. 1994, ch. 218, sec. 7, p. 692; am. 1996, ch. 369, sec. 1, p. 1241; am. 1997, ch. 231, sec. 1, p. 672; am. 2001, ch. 172, sec. 2, p. 590; am. 2004, ch. 189, sec. 2, p. 590; am. 2005, ch. 403, sec. 2, p. 1369; am. 2009, ch. 217, sec. 1, p. 677; am. 2017, ch. 195, sec. 3, p. 463; am. 2019, ch. 252, sec. 1, p. 757; am. 2022, ch. 269, sec. 2, p. 861.]",
