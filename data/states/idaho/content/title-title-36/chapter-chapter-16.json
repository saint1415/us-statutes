An owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the land safe for entry by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such land to persons entering for such purposes. Neither the installation of a sign or other form of warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity, nor any modification made for the purpose of improving the safety of others, nor the failure to maintain or keep in place any sign, other form of warning, or modification made to improve safety, shall create liability on the part of an owner of land where there is no other basis for such liability.\n\n(d) Owner Assumes No Liability. An owner of land or equipment who either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge any person to use such property for recreational purposes does not thereby:\n\n(1) Extend any assurance that the land is safe for any purpose.\n\n(2) Confer upon such person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed.\n\n(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to person or property caused by an act or omission of such persons.\n\n(e) Provisions Apply to Leased Public Land.

Membership dues in, and donations to, a recreation club shall not be considered a charge or fee for a recreation activity.\n\n(d) \"Recreation club\" means an unincorporated association formed pursuant to chapter 27, title 30, Idaho Code, or a nonprofit corporation organized pursuant to chapter 30, title 30, Idaho Code, that has among its purposes the coordination, facilitation, organization, participation, promotion, or support of recreation activities.\n\n(3) Limitation of Liability of Recreation Clubs. Except as provided in subsection (4), a recreation club and a club member shall not be liable for any injury to or the death of a participant engaged in a recreation activity, and no participant nor participant’s representative or survivor may maintain an action against or recover from a recreation club or a club member for any injury to or the death of a participant engaged in a recreation activity.\n\n(4) Exceptions. The limitation of liability set forth in subsection (3) shall not apply in the following instances:\n\n(a) With respect to a recreation club where the recreation club provides equipment to the participant and the provided equipment is the direct and proximate cause of the injury to or death of the participant;\n\n(b) With respect to a club member where the club member provides equipment to the participant and the provided equipment is the direct and proximate cause of the injury to or death of the participant;\n\n(c) With respect to a club member where the club member commits an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful and wanton disregard for the safety of the participant and that act or omission is the direct and proximate cause of the injury or death;\n\n(d) With respect to a club member where the club member intentionally injures the participant;\n\n(e) With respect to a club member where the club member fails to exercise ordinary care in the club member’s own participation in the recreation activity and such failure is the direct and proximate cause of the injury to or the death of the participant. The mere fact that the club member coordinated, facilitated, organized, participated in, promoted, or supported the recreation activity shall not, in itself, be sufficient to constitute a failure to exercise ordinary care where there is no other basis for liability;\n\n(f) Under the liability provisions as set forth in the products liability laws; or\n\n(g) Under the liability provisions set forth in chapter 9, title 6; chapter 11, title 6; chapter 12, title 6; chapter 18, title 6; chapter 27, title 6; chapter 29, title 6; or chapter 33, title 6, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) Limitation of Duties. A recreation club and a club member has no duty to eliminate, alter, control, or lessen the risks inherent with recreation activities. A recreation club and a club member owe no duty of care to make any recreation activity safe for a participant. A participant who takes part in a recreation activity assumes all risks inherent in that activity.\n\n(6) Waiver of Negligence Claims. Any participant may, by express written consent, prospectively waive negligence claims against a recreation club and a club member. It is the policy of this state that such written liability waivers are enforceable to the same degree as similar waivers for other activities.\n\n[36-1605, added 2025, ch. 214, sec. 1, p. 1020.]",
