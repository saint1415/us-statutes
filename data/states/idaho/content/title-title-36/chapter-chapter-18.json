Such publication shall be given so that the first such publication shall be at least ten (10) and not more than fifteen (15) days before the date of hearing and if published weekly, shall be published in at least two (2) successive issues and if published daily, shall be published in at least seven (7) successive issues. The notices shall contain a brief description of the proposed project and a general description of the proposed location thereof and the place and time of hearing and state that all interested persons may appear and be heard.\n\nAt the hearing, the commission shall present or cause to be presented oral and documentary evidence as to the land areas affected, the existing use of and production from said lands, the probable changes in use and production of said lands if included in such project, the existing tax to all taxing districts payable from such lands and the estimated amount of any payments in lieu of taxes, if any, and to what taxing district such in-lieu payments will be made if the lands be included in such project. The board of county commissioners of the county or counties affected and other persons present may present oral or documentary evidence upon any of the above matters and upon any other matters showing the economic effect the proposal would have upon the county or counties and their residents.
