      "text": "57-903. FINDINGS OF STATE INTERESTS — PURPOSES. (1) The code provides that interest with respect to certain obligations may not be exempt from federal income taxation unless they are in registered form. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be authorized to provide for the issuance of obligations in such form. It is a purpose of this act to empower all public entities to establish and maintain a system pursuant to which obligations may be issued in registered form within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the code.\n\n(2) Obligations have traditionally been issued in bearer rather than in registered form, and a change from bearer to registered form may affect the relationships, rights and duties of issuers of and the persons that deal with obligations, and by such effect, the costs. Such effects will impact the various issuers and varieties of obligations differently depending on their legal and financial characteristics, their markets and their adaptability to recent and prospective technological and organizational developments. It is, therefore, a matter of state concern that public entities be provided flexibility in the development of such systems and control over system incidents, so as to accommodate such differing impacts. It is a purpose of this act to empower the establishment and maintenance, and amendment from time to time, of differing systems of registration of obligations, including system incidents, so as to accommodate the differing impacts upon issuers and varieties of obligations. It is further a purpose of this act to authorize systems that will facilitate the prompt and accurate transfer of registered public obligations and develop practices with regard to the registration and transfer of registered public obligations.\n\n[57-903, added 1983, ch. 98, sec. 1, p. 212.]",

      "text": "57-904. SYSTEMS OF REGISTRATION. (1) Each issuer is authorized to establish and maintain a system of registration with respect to each obligation which it issues. The system may either be (a) a system pursuant to which only certificated registered public obligations are issued, or (b) a system pursuant to which only uncertificated registered public obligations are issued, or (c) a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued. The issuer may amend, discontinue and reinstitute any system, from time to time, subject to covenants.\n\n(2) The system shall be established, amended, discontinued, or reinstituted for the issuer by, and shall be maintained for the issuer as provided by, the official or official body.\n\n(3) The system shall be described in the registered public obligation or in the official actions which provide for original issuance of the registered public obligation, and in subsequent official actions providing for amendments and other matters from time to time. Such description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official or official body.\n\n(4) The system shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered public obligation shall be effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and any interest shall be made. The system may permit the issuance of registered public obligations in any denomination to represent several registered public obligations of smaller denominations. The system may also provide for the form of any certificated registered public obligation or of any writing relating to an uncertificated registered public obligation, for identifying numbers or other designations, for a sufficient supply of certificates for subsequent transfers, for record and payment dates, for varying denominations, for communications to holders or owners of obligations, and for accounting, cancelled certificate destruction, registration and release of security interests and other incidental matters. Unless the issuer otherwise provides, the record date for interest payable on the first or fifteenth days of a month shall be the fifteenth day or the last business day of the preceding month, respectively, and for interest payable on other than the first or fifteenth days of a month, shall be the fifteenth calendar day before the interest payment date.\n\n(5) Under a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued, both types of registered public obligations may be regularly issued, or one type may be regularly issued and the other type issued only under described circumstances or to particular described categories of owners and provision may be made for registration and release of security interests in registered public obligations.\n\n(6) The system may include covenants of the issuer as to amendments, discontinuances, and reinstitutions of the system and the effect of such on the exemption of interest from the income tax provided for by the code.\n\n(7) Whenever an issuer shall issue an uncertificated registered public obligation, the system of registration may provide that a true copy of the official actions of the issuer relating to the uncertificated registered public obligation be maintained by the issuer and by the person, if any, maintaining the system on behalf of the issuer, so long as the uncertificated registered public obligation remains outstanding and unpaid. A copy of the official actions, verified by an authorized officer, shall be admissible before any court of record, administrative body or arbitration panel without further authentication.\n\n(8) Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a conversion from one of the forms of registered public obligations provided for by this chapter to a form of obligation not provided for by this chapter if interest on the obligation so converted will continue to be exempt from the income tax provided for by the code.\n\n(9) The rights provided by other laws with respect to obligations in forms not provided for by this chapter shall, to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter, apply with respect to registered public obligations issued in forms authorized in this chapter.\n\n[57-904, added 1983, ch. 98, sec. 1, p. 212.]",

None of such agents need have an office or do business within this state.\n\n(2) An issuer may agree with custodian banks and financial intermediaries, and nominees of any of them, in connection with the establishment and maintenance by others of a central depository system for the transfer or pledge of registered public obligations. Any such custodian banks and financial intermediaries, and nominees, may, if qualified and acting as fiduciaries, also serve as authenticating agents, transfer agents, registrars, paying or other agents of the issuer with respect to the same issue of registered public obligations.\n\n(3) Nothing shall preclude the issuer from itself performing, either alone or jointly with other issuers, any transfer, registration, authentication, payment or other function described in this section.\n\n[57-908, added 1983, ch. 98, sec. 1, p. 214.]",

The portion of the costs of the system not provided to be paid for by the transferor or transferee or out of proceeds shall be the liability of the issuer.\n\n(2) The issuer may as a part of a system of registration provide for reimbursement or for satisfaction of its liability by payment by others.
