Gains to permanent endowment funds shall be determined by the investment board when the current market value of the permanent endowment fund as of the end of the fiscal year exceeds the gain benchmark market value of the permanent endowment fund. Gains for each permanent endowment fund shall be calculated as of June 30 of each fiscal year by subtracting the gain benchmark market value as of June 30 of such year, after all adjustments set out in this section, from the current market value of the permanent endowment fund as of the same June 30 date. The gain benchmark market value shall begin with the market value of the permanent endowment fund calculated as it existed on June 30, 2000, and shall be adjusted cumulatively as of June 30 of each fiscal year thereafter for inflation during the preceding year based on the unadjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers as published by the United States department of labor, hereafter referred to in this section as \"CPI-U,\" and further adjusted for certain deposits of funds into the permanent endowment fund during the preceding year, such adjustments to be calculated as follows:\n\n(a) Inflation Adjustment. The gain benchmark market value shall be adjusted for inflation as of June 30 of each fiscal year by multiplying the gain benchmark market value as of the commencement of business on July 1 of the preceding calendar year by the sum of one (1) plus the percentage change in the average CPI-U for the fiscal year then ending. The percentage change in the average CPI-U shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the average CPI-U for the fiscal year then ending less the average CPI-U for the preceding fiscal year, and the denominator of which is the average CPI-U for the preceding fiscal year. The average CPI-U for each fiscal year shall be calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly CPI-U index figures for such fiscal year, July through June, by twelve (12).\n\n(b) Deposit of Funds. After adjustment for inflation, the gain benchmark market value shall be further adjusted by adding the amount of funds deposited into the permanent endowment fund from and including July 1 of the preceding calendar year through and including the June 30 date of adjustment, from any of the following sources:\n\n(i) Land sales proceeds not deposited into the land bank fund under section 58-133(2), Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) Funds transferred from the land bank fund after expiration of the time frame under section 58-133(3), Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) Mineral royalty payments; or\n\n(iv) Such other deposits into the permanent endowment fund as are required by law or otherwise permitted to be added to the permanent endowment fund except for the following:\n\n1. Deposits to make up for losses to the permanent endowment fund;\n\n2. Deposits of earnings reserves if the state board of land commissioners directs that such deposit not be added to the gain benchmark market value; or\n\n3. Other deposits, including bequests, to the permanent endowment fund if the depositor or grantor thereof directs that the deposit not be added to the gain benchmark market value.\n\n(c) Gain Benchmark Floor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in no event shall the gain benchmark market value fall below the permanent corpus balance. For purposes of this subsection, the permanent corpus balance shall be calculated by adding to the permanent endowment fund balance as of June 30, 2000, all deposits to the permanent endowment fund up to and including the June 30 date of adjustment, other than deposits resulting from the investment activities of the permanent endowment fund and deposits made to make up losses to the permanent endowment fund.\n\n(2) Losses. Losses to permanent endowment funds shall be determined by the investment board when the market value of the permanent endowment fund as of the end of the fiscal year is less than the loss benchmark market value of the permanent endowment fund. The investment board shall calculate any annual loss as well as the cumulative loss for each permanent endowment fund as of June 30 of the fiscal year.\n\n(a) Cumulative Loss. The cumulative loss for each permanent endowment fund shall be equal to the difference between the loss benchmark market value as of June 30 of the fiscal year, after all adjustments to the loss benchmark market value as set out below in this subsection (2), and the current market value of the permanent endowment fund as of the same June 30 date.\n\n(b) Annual Loss. The annual loss for a fiscal year shall be equal to the increase, if any, of the cumulative loss as of June 30 of such fiscal year, compared to the cumulative loss as of June 30 of the preceding fiscal year.\n\n(c) Loss Benchmark. The loss benchmark market value for each permanent endowment fund shall begin with the market value of the permanent endowment fund calculated as it existed on June 30, 2000, and shall be adjusted cumulatively as of June 30 of each fiscal year thereafter by adding the amount of funds deposited into the permanent endowment fund from and including July 1 of the preceding calendar year through and including the June 30 date of adjustment, from any of the following sources:\n\n(i) Land sales proceeds not deposited into the land bank fund under section 58-133(2), Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) Funds transferred from the land bank fund after expiration of the time frame under section 58-133(3), Idaho Code;\n\n(iii) Mineral royalty payments; or\n\n(iv) Such other deposits into the permanent endowment fund as are required by law or otherwise permitted to be added to the permanent endowment fund except for the following:\n\n1. Deposits to make up for losses to the permanent endowment fund; and\n\n2. Deposits of earnings reserves.\n\n(d) Loss Recovery. Cumulative losses in permanent endowment funds other than the public school permanent endowment fund may be made up from earnings reserve fund moneys that the state board of land commissioners determines will not be needed for administrative costs or scheduled distributions to each endowment’s respective income fund. Cumulative losses in the public school permanent endowment fund shall be made up as follows:\n\n(i) The state board of land commissioners may transfer any funds in the public school earnings reserve fund that it determines will not be needed for administrative costs or scheduled distributions to the public school income fund in the following fiscal year to the public school permanent endowment fund, to make up for all or part of any then existing cumulative losses in the public school permanent endowment fund.\n\n(ii) If a cumulative loss exists in the public school permanent endowment fund as of the end of a fiscal year, and there has also been a cumulative loss at the end of each of the preceding nine (9) fiscal years, for a total of ten (10) consecutive fiscal years ending with a cumulative loss, then, to the extent the then existing cumulative loss is not made up from transfers of earnings reserves under subsection (2)(d)(i) of this section, the legislature shall, by legislative transfer or appropriation authorized during one (1) or both of the next succeeding two (2) regular sessions of the legislature, authorize a deposit to the public school permanent endowment fund in an amount equal to the lesser of:\n\n1. The current cumulative loss; or\n\n2. An amount not less than the annual loss determined in the first year of the preceding ten (10) consecutive fiscal years, provided however, the legislature may offset the amount of this annual loss by any deposits of earnings reserves made by the land board into the public school permanent endowment fund after the end of the fiscal year for which such annual loss was calculated, but only to the extent any such deposit of earnings reserves has not been used previously to offset the amount of a prior legislative deposit under this subparagraph 2.\n\n(iii) The deposit of any transfer or appropriation authorized by the legislature under subsection (2)(d)(ii) of this section shall take place after the end of the fiscal year in which the deposit was authorized by the legislature, and as soon as is practicable once the investment board has calculated the cumulative loss in the public school permanent endowment fund as of the end of the fiscal year; provided however, in the event the cumulative loss as of the end of such fiscal year is less than the amount of the authorized deposit, the deposit shall be reduced to an amount equal to the cumulative loss, and the balance of the authorized deposit shall be returned to the source of the deposit.\n\n[57-724 added 1998, ch. 256, sec. 42, p. 841; am. 2001, ch. 254, sec. 2, p. 920; am. 2004, ch. 132, sec. 2, p. 451; am. 2006, ch. 43, sec. 1, p. 130.]",

Nothing in this section shall require the board to hold at any time in excess of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) in notes issued pursuant to the credit enhancement program. The principal amount of bonds guaranteed by the credit enhancement program shall not be greater than four (4) times the amount made available by the board from the public school endowment fund for the purpose of purchasing notes.\n\n(8) The aggregate principal amount of school district bonds outstanding that may be guaranteed by the credit enhancement program shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000) per school district. In the event school districts consolidate, the maximum credit enhancement of the bonds of the newly consolidated school district shall be the sum of the maximum limit of each school district participating in the consolidation. The state treasurer shall monitor the principal amounts of each school district participating in the credit enhancement program and provide such information to the board.\n\n(9) Any bond originally guaranteed under this chapter shall no longer be considered guaranteed from and after the date on which that bond no longer has the benefit of the Idaho school bond guaranty program established in chapter 53, title 33, Idaho Code.\n\n[57-728, added 1999, ch. 328, sec. 3, p. 850; am. 2002, ch. 147, sec. 1, p. 424; am. 2003, ch. 269, sec. 1, p. 719; am. 2007, ch. 89, sec. 1, p. 243; am. 2009, ch. 185, sec. 6, p. 605; am. 2016, ch. 136, sec. 1, p. 400.]",
