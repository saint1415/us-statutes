For purposes of this section, the reimbursement for loss of wages shall be at the employee’s then current rate of pay if the employee is then working; otherwise, such reimbursement shall be at the total temporary disability rate. Reimbursement for travel expenses, if the employee utilizes a private vehicle, shall be at the mileage rate allowed by the state board of examiners for state employees; provided, however, that the employee shall not be reimbursed for the first fifteen (15) miles of any round trip, nor for traveling any round trip distance of fifteen (15) miles or less. Such distance shall be calculated by the shortest practical route of travel.\n\n(2) The employee shall have the right to have a physician or surgeon designated and paid by himself present at an examination by a physician or surgeon so designated by the employer. Such right, however, shall not be construed to deny the employer’s designated physician or surgeon the right to visit the injured employee during reasonable times and under all reasonable conditions during disability. The employee and the examining physician shall have the right to have an audio recording of any examination, but may have a video recording only if the examining physician and the employee consent.\n\n(3) At any time after injury, if an injured employee be sent to a facility approved by the commission for physical or vocational rehabilitation, the employee shall be furnished by the employer reasonable travel accommodations to and from such facility and if the injured employee is an outpatient in a physical rehabilitation facility, he shall be paid daily subsistence as the commission may authorize to cover reasonable expenses of board, lodging and transportation. Reimbursement for transportation expense, if the employee utilizes a private vehicle, shall be at the mileage rate allowed by the state board of examiners for state employees; provided however, that the employee shall not be reimbursed for the first fifteen (15) miles of any round trip, nor for traveling any round trip distance of fifteen (15) miles or less. Such distance shall be calculated by the shortest practical route of travel.\n\n[72-433, as added by 1971, ch. 124, sec. 3, p. 422; am. 1974, ch. 132, sec. 5, p. 1329; am. 1990, ch. 110, sec. 1, p. 221; am. 1997, ch. 274, sec. 10, p. 811.]",

(1) When an employee, because he has nondisabling silicosis, is discharged from employment in which he is engaged, or when such an employee, after an examination as provided in subsection (2) of this section, and a finding by the medical panel that it is inadvisable for him to continue in his employment, terminates his employment, the commission may allow such compensation on account of such termination of employment as it may deem just, as support money pending his change of employment, payable as in this law elsewhere provided, but in no case to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000).\n\n(2) Upon application of any employer or employee, the commission may direct any employee of such employer or any employee who, in the course of his employment has been exposed to the inhalation of silica dust, to submit to a medical examination to determine whether the employee has silicosis, and the degree thereof. The results of the examination shall be submitted to the commission, which shall submit copies of such reports to the employer and employee, who shall have opportunity to rebut the same, provided, request therefor is made to the commission within thirty (30) days from the mailing of such report to the parties. The commission shall make its findings as to whether it is inadvisable for the employee to continue in his employment.\n\n[72-446, added I.C., sec. 72-446, as added by 1971, ch. 124, sec. 3, p. 422.]",
