This chapter establishes an automated state directory of new hires to be administered by the department of labor for the purpose of securing for this state the maximum benefits of the act of congress, approved August 22, 1996, known as the \"Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.\" The state directory of new hires provides a means for employers to assist in the state’s efforts to prevent fraud in the welfare, worker’s compensation, and unemployment insurance programs, to locate individuals to establish paternity, to locate absent parents who owe child support, and to collect support from those parents by reporting information concerning newly hired and rehired employees directly to a centralized state database.\n\n[72-1602, added 1997, ch. 340, sec. 1, p. 1017.]",
