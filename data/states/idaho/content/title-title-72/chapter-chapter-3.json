      "text": "72-301. SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION. (1) Every employer shall secure the payment of compensation under this law in one (1) of the following ways:\n\n(a) By insuring and keeping insured with a policy of worker’s compensation insurance as defined in section 41-506(d), Idaho Code, the payment of compensation with any insurer, as defined in section 41-103, Idaho Code, authorized by the director of the department of insurance to transact such insurance, provided, that every public employer shall insure its liability for payment of compensation with the state insurance fund unless such fund shall refuse to accept the risk when the application for insurance is made; or\n\n(b) An employer may become self-insured by obtaining the approval of the industrial commission and by depositing and maintaining in a custodial account with the state treasurer money or acceptable security instruments satisfactory to the commission securing the payment by said employer of compensation according to the terms of this law. Such acceptable security instruments are bonds, treasury bills, interest-bearing notes or other obligations of the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest. In lieu of such money or security instruments, the commission may allow or require such employer to file or maintain with the state treasurer a surety bond with any company authorized to transact surety insurance in Idaho. The commission shall adopt rules governing the qualifications of self-insured employers, the nature and amount of security to be deposited and maintained with the state treasurer, and the conditions under which an employer may continue to be self-insured.\n\n(2) No insurer shall be permitted to transact worker’s compensation insurance covering the liability of employers under this law unless it shall have been authorized to do business under the laws of this state and until it shall have received the approval of the commission. To the end that the workers secured under this law shall be adequately protected, the commission shall require such insurer to deposit and maintain in a custodial account with the state treasurer money or acceptable security instruments in an amount equal to the total amounts of all outstanding and unpaid compensation awards against such insurer. Acceptable security instruments are bonds, treasury bills, interest-bearing notes or other obligations of the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest. Acceptable security instruments also include municipal bonds issued by the state of Idaho and its subdivisions, counties, cities, towns, villages and school districts. The insurer shall have the responsibility to monitor the ratings for its bonds. Bonds held by worker’s compensation insurers in support of insurance obligations must have been assigned a credit rating grade not less than \"single A minus\" by one (1) or more credit rating providers registered with the United States securities and exchange commission as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). If the credit rating assigned to the bond by the NRSRO is downgraded below \"single A minus,\" the worker’s compensation insurer shall within thirty (30) days of the downgrade replace the bond with one that meets the credit quality requirement specified in this section. In lieu of such money or security instruments, the commission may allow or require such insurer to file or maintain with the state treasurer a surety bond of some company or companies authorized to do business in this state for and in the amounts equaling the total unpaid compensation awards against such insurer.\n\n(3) When an insurer has been placed in liquidation, any security being held in a custodial account with the state treasurer under this section shall be converted into cash and transferred into the insolvent insurer fund created in subsection (4) of this section. Such funds shall continue to be held for the purpose of securing any future claims made against the insolvent insurer under this law or until released by the commission to the liquidator, if one exists, or to the insurer’s state of domicile, as provided herein. Interest earned on moneys deposited in the insolvent insurer fund shall be credited, pro rata, to the account balance of security being held to answer claims made under this law against an insolvent insurer. Moneys deposited in the insolvent insurer fund may be used to pay the reasonable costs or expenses charged by any financial institution holding such funds on deposit for the state treasurer. Any balance in funds remaining on deposit in the insolvent insurer fund to answer the claims of an insolvent insurer after discharge of that insurer’s liquidator may be transferred to the liquidator, if one still exists, or to the liquidated insurer’s state of domicile, at such time as the commission determines that said security is no longer required to be held by the state treasurer for the purposes of this law.\n\n(4) There is hereby created in the state treasury the insolvent insurer fund. Moneys in the fund are hereby continuously appropriated for the purposes set forth in the provisions of this section. Interest earned on moneys in the fund shall be returned to the fund.\n\n(5) The approval by the commission of any insurer or self-insured employer may be withdrawn if it appears to the commission that workers secured thereby under this law are not fully protected.\n\n(6) For the purposes of this section, the term \"public employer\" shall not include any single-purpose district organized or that may be organized as a local public body in accordance with the laws of the state of Idaho for the purpose of constructing or furnishing any municipal service. For the purposes of this section, a \"public employer\" includes a city, county, and school district. The provisions of this subsection shall be null, void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2030. Prior to July 1, 2030, the legislature may evaluate the effectiveness of the provisions of this subsection, including whether to remove this subsection or revise the definition of \"public employer\" provided in this subsection to include cities, counties, and school districts.\n\n[72-301, added 1971, ch. 124, sec. 3, p. 422; am. 1974, ch. 208, sec. 2, p. 1538; am. 2011, ch. 198, sec. 1, p. 581; am. 2014, ch. 96, sec. 1, p. 262; am. 2016, ch. 282, sec. 1, p. 780; am. 2025, ch. 105, sec. 1, p. 562.]",

The provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code, with respect to security, shall be met alternatively, by the employer demonstrating to the commission that security for its self-insured worker’s compensation program is covered by a cost reimbursement contract with the federal government for work performed in connection with the Idaho national laboratory including research, development, demonstration, testing, national security, defense, environmental cleanup or waste management if the cost reimbursement contract provides for the payment as otherwise required in this chapter. An employer that becomes self-insured under this section is not required to provide and maintain a security deposit, is not required to have a payroll history and is not required to have excess insurance coverage. In addition, because of the federal government reimbursement, the employer’s self-insurance program includes coverage for claims for events taking place before the effective date of the self-insured program, and no separate coverage or deposit for such claims is required.\n\nThe commission shall promulgate rules governing the administration of employer self-insurance under this section.\n\n[72-301A, added 2014, ch. 96, sec. 2, p. 264.]",

In any case where the employer is a corporation or a limited liability company, any officer or employee of the corporation or member, manager, or employee of a limited liability company who had authority to secure payment of compensation on behalf of the corporation or limited liability company and failed to do so shall individually be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(2) Such officer, employee, member, or manager shall be personally liable jointly and severally with such corporation or limited liability company for any compensation that may accrue under this law in respect to any injury or occupational disease suffered by any employee of such corporation or limited liability company while it shall so fail to secure the payment of compensation.\n\n(3) Any employer who knowingly transfers, sells, encumbers, assigns, or in any manner disposes of, conceals, secretes or destroys any property or records belonging to such employer, after one (1) of its employees has been afflicted by an injury or occupational disease, with intent to avoid the payment of compensation to such employee or his dependents, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. In any case where such employer is a corporation or limited liability company, any officer, employee, member, or manager thereof, if knowingly participating or acquiescing in any such act, shall also be individually guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(4) Any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this law who fails to do so may be liable for a penalty of either two dollars ($2.00) for each employee for each day or twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each day during which such failure continues, whichever is greater, and in cases where the employer is a corporation or limited liability company and is unable to pay the fine, any officer or employee of the corporation or member or manager of a limited liability company who had authority to secure payment of compensation on behalf of the corporation or a limited liability company and failed to do so shall be liable for a like penalty, to be recovered for the time during which such failure continued, but for not more than three (3) consecutive years, in an action brought by the commission in the name of the state of Idaho; any amount so collected shall be paid into the industrial administration fund; for this purpose, the district court of any county in which the employer carries on any part of its trade or occupation shall have jurisdiction. In determining whether penalties should be assessed or collected for the employer’s failure to secure the payment of compensation, the commission may consider the following factors:\n\n(a) When the employer was notified that such employer’s worker’s compensation insurance coverage had been canceled or that such insurance was required;\n\n(b) The length of time that elapsed between when the employer was notified that worker’s compensation insurance coverage was required, or that such employer’s coverage had been canceled, and the date that such coverage was put into effect;\n\n(c) Whether the employer is able to document attempts to secure worker’s compensation insurance coverage during the period of time that such employer was without such coverage;\n\n(d) Whether there were prior instances in which the employer failed to keep worker’s compensation insurance in effect or such coverage was canceled and the reasons for such failure or cancellation;\n\n(e) The reasons that the employer is unable to obtain or keep in effect worker’s compensation insurance coverage;\n\nThe above factors are not exclusive and the commission may consider any other relevant factor.\n\n(5) If any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this law is or has been in default under section 72-301, Idaho Code, the employer may be enjoined by the district court of any county in which such employer carries on any part of its trade or occupation from carrying on such business while any default under section 72-301, Idaho Code, exists. All proceedings in the courts under this section are to be brought by the industrial commission in the name of the state of Idaho.\n\n(6) An employer who fails to secure the payment of compensation and who has been assessed a penalty within the previous three (3) years pursuant to section 72-319(4), Idaho Code, shall be liable for the following penalty in addition to the penalty provided by section 72-319(4), Idaho Code:\n\n(a) Five hundred dollars ($500) for the second failure to secure the payment of compensation;\n\n(b) One thousand dollars ($1,000) for the third and any subsequent failure to secure the payment of compensation.\n\n[72-319, added 1971, ch. 124, sec. 3, p. 422; am. 1973, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 203; am. 1988, ch. 239, sec. 1, p. 467; am. 1990, ch. 322, sec. 1, p. 880; am. 1992, ch. 308, sec. 1, p. 919; am. 1997, ch. 304, sec. 1, p. 906; am. 2025, ch. 66, sec. 1, p. 316.]",
