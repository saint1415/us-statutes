The legislature finds that the rights and protections provided to peace officers and detention officers under this chapter constitute matters of statewide concern. Since these officers are employed in dangerous conditions, it is necessary that this chapter be applicable to all such officers wherever situated within the state of Idaho. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, state and local law enforcement agencies may provide additional monetary protections for their employees.\n\n[72-1101, added 2007, ch. 365, sec. 1, p. 1098.]",
