The moneys in the training fund shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n(a) To provide training and retraining for skills necessary for specific economic opportunities and industrial expansion initiatives;\n\n(b) To provide innovative training solutions to meet industry-specific workforce needs or local workforce challenges;\n\n(c) To provide public information and outreach on career education and workforce training opportunities, including existing education and training programs and services not funded by the training fund; and\n\n(d) For all administrative expenses incurred by the council, including those expenses associated with the collection of the training tax and any other administrative expenses associated with the training fund.\n\n(3) Expenditures from the training fund for purposes authorized in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2) of this section shall be approved by the council based on procedures, criteria and performance measures established by the council.\n\n(4) Expenditures from the training fund for purposes authorized in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of this section shall be approved by the executive director.
