Irrespective of the date of retirement, at least once each year during the first five (5) years following the retirement of a firefighter with a disability retirement pension and in any three (3) year period thereafter, the public employee retirement system board may, or upon the disabled firefighter’s application shall, require the disabled firefighter to undergo a medical examination, to be made by or under the direction of a physician designated by the board, at the place of residence of said disabled firefighter or other place mutually agreed upon. Should any disabled firefighter refuse to submit to such medical examination in any period, his or her disability retirement may be discontinued by the board and should such refusal continue for one (1) year all his or her rights in and to his or her disability retirement pension shall be revoked by the board. If upon such medical examination of said disabled firefighter, the said physician reports to the board that said disabled firefighter is physically able and capable of resuming employment in the classification held by him or her at the time of his or her retirement, he or she shall be restored to active service in the employment of the city or fire district and payment of his or her disability retirement shall cease, provided the report of the physician is concurred in by the board. A disabled firefighter so restored to active service shall from the date of his or her return to service become a member of the retirement system, thereafter in the same manner as prior to his or her disability retirement. Any service credited to him or her at the time of his or her disability retirement shall be restored to full force and effect. He or she shall be given credit for the period he or she was receiving service disability pension, provided under section 72-1445, Idaho Code; he or she shall not be given service credit for the period he or she was receiving a nonservice disability pension, provided under section 72-1446, Idaho Code. When a disabled firefighter on a disability retirement engages in work activities commensurate with the physical demands that were required in his or her classification as a firefighter, the work performed may demonstrate that said firefighter has the ability to be restored as a firefighter in the employ of the city or fire district. However, the circumstances under which the work was performed generally must be considered. Where said disabled firefighter has to discontinue his or her work after a short time because of his or her impairment, his or her work activities would not demonstrate ability to resume his or her employment as a firefighter. The findings of the adequacy of the said firefighter’s performance of work activities must be concurred in by the board. If said firefighter has a disability which is amenable to corrective treatment that could be expected to restore his or her efficient performance of duties of a paid firefighter, as defined in section 72-1403(G), Idaho Code, he or she would be considered disabled, provided he or she is undergoing the treatment prescribed by the medical committee, as set forth in section 72-1445, Idaho Code.\n\nHowever, nothing in this section shall be construed to require a firefighter who in good faith relies on or is treated by prayer through spiritual means alone by a duly accredited practitioner of a well-recognized church to undergo any medical or surgical treatment, nor shall he or his dependents be deprived of any benefits hereunder to which he would have been entitled if medical or surgical treatment were employed.\n\n[(72-1451) 1976, ch. 273, sec. 24, p. 942; am. 1980, ch. 50, sec. 37, p. 100; 1990, am. and redesignated, ch. 231, sec. 98, p. 660; am. 1990, ch. 249, sec. 17, p. 717.]",
