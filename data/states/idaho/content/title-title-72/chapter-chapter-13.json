Unemployment is a subject of national and state concern. This chapter addresses this problem by encouraging employers to offer stable employment and by systematically accumulating funds during periods of employment to pay benefits for periods of unemployment. The legislature declares that the general welfare of our citizens requires the enactment of this measure and sets aside unemployment reserves to be used for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own.\n\n[72-1302, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 2, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 2, p. 252; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 2, p. 6.]",

      "text": "72-1303A. ABLE TO WORK — AVAILABLE FOR SUITABLE WORK. (1) \"Able to work\" means having the physical and mental ability to perform work for which a claimant is qualified under conditions ordinarily existing during a normal workweek. It does not mean that a person must be able to perform work in his customary occupation or the same kind of work he last performed. A person who is able to work only part of the workday or part of the workweek is not considered able to work.\n\n(2) An individual with a disability under the Americans with disabilities act, 42 U.S.C. 12112, as defined by 29 CFR 1630.2(g), whose disability prevents the claimant from working full time or during particular shifts is not deemed unable to work or unavailable for work for as long as the claimant demonstrates he is able to perform some work and remains available for work to the full extent of his ability. A qualified claimant with a disability who is able to work with or without a reasonable accommodation will be considered as having complied with the requirement of being available for work when the claimant is willing to work the maximum number of hours the claimant is able to work. Qualified claimants with disabilities must meet all other eligibility requirements, including the illness provisions of this section.\n\n(3)(a) A claimant who withdraws from the labor market because of illness or injury prior to filing a claim is not eligible for unemployment benefits until he is able and available for work; provided, no claimant shall be considered ineligible with respect to any week of unemployment for failure to comply with this section if the failure is due to an illness or disability that commences after applying for unemployment benefits and no work that would have been suitable prior to the beginning of the illness or injury has been offered the claimant.\n\n(b) A person who claims benefits under this illness provision must remain available for job referral by the department; however, he may leave the area for treatment of his illness and continue to be eligible under the provisions of this section.\n\n(4) \"Available for suitable work\" means remaining within and actively seeking suitable work in a locality in which the individual has earned wages subject to the provisions of this chapter during the individual’s base period or, if the individual moves his permanent residence outside of that locality, then in a locality where suitable work normally is performed. Being available for suitable work encompasses a readiness, ability, and willingness to work and to find a job, including the possibility of marketing the claimant’s services in the claimant’s area of availability. The type of work for which the claimant is available must exist in the claimant’s area to the extent that a normal unemployed person would generally find work within a reasonable period of time.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this section, \"workweek\" means:\n\n(a) For an employer-attached or union-attached classification, the claimant’s normal workweek as defined by the employer or union;\n\n(b) For a work-seeking classification, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; or\n\n(c) For an approved training classification, regular class hours.\n\n(6) Claimant work availability requirements are waived on Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.\n\n(7) A claimant seeking work must be willing to travel the distance normally traveled by other workers in his area and occupation.\n\n(8) An individual who restricts availability to part-time work pursuant to section 72-1366(4)(d), Idaho Code, is considered fully employed and ineligible to receive benefits if the individual works hours comparable to the part-time work experience in the individual’s base period. A claimant must be available for a full workweek and a full, normal workday unless the claimant establishes that the majority of weeks worked during the claimant’s base period were for less than full-time work, which is established where the total base period wages divided by the claimant’s last regular rate of pay does not exceed two thousand seventy-nine (2,079) hours.\n\n(9) A claimant who is incarcerated for any part of the workweek is not eligible for benefits for that week, unless the claimant can establish he has work release privileges that would provide him a reasonable opportunity to meet his work search requirements and obtain full-time employment.\n\n(10) A claimant who moves to a remote locality where there is little possibility of obtaining suitable work is not eligible for benefits.\n\n(11) A public official who receives pay and performs full-time service is considered employed and not eligible for benefits. Part-time officials, even though receiving pay, may be considered available for work the same as any other individual employed on a part-time basis.\n\n(12) Performing public service, including voluntary non-remunerated service, does not disqualify an individual for benefits as long as he meets the other requirements of this section.\n\n(13) A claimant who restricts his availability to only work done within the home in a manner that severely limits the work available to him is not eligible for benefits, unless the claimant works in an industry where teleworking is common.\n\n(14) A person who is attending school or a training course not approved by the department pursuant to section 72-1366(8), Idaho Code, may be eligible for benefits if attendance does not conflict with that person’s availability for work or for seeking work and if he will discontinue attendance upon receipt of an offer of employment that creates a conflict between employment and the schooling or training.\n\n(15) All claimants, regardless of their attachment to an industry or employer, must meet the same standard of remaining within their local labor market area during the workweek in order to be considered available for work, unless the primary purpose of a temporary absence is to seek work in another labor market. Claimants otherwise eligible to receive benefits while participating in an approved training program or course are not deemed ineligible when the training or course occurs outside of their local labor market due to the unavailability of similar programs or courses within their local labor market.\n\n(16) To remain eligible for benefits, claimants must remain within a state, territory, or country included in the United States department of labor’s interstate benefit payment plan.\n\n(17) A claimant who places unreasonable restrictions on working conditions that significantly hinder his availability and search for work is not eligible for benefits.\n\n(18) A person on a vacation approved by his employer during time when work is available is not eligible for benefits.\n\n(19) A claimant is eligible for benefits if the wages or other conditions of available work are substantially less favorable to the claimant than those prevailing for similar work in the local area.\n\n(20) A claimant is not eligible for benefits if he unduly restricts his availability for work by insisting on a wage rate that is higher than the prevailing wage for similar work in that area.\n\n(21) The claimant’s prior earnings and past experience are considered in determining whether work is suitable.\n\n(22) For the purpose of approving a waiver of the two (2) year limitation on school or training courses specified by section 72-1366(8)(c)(ii), Idaho Code, for claimants who lack skills to compete in the labor market, the following criteria must be met:\n\n(a) The claimant must demonstrate a workable financial plan for completing the school or training course after his benefits have been exhausted;\n\n(b) The claimant must establish there is a demand for the occupation in which the claimant will be trained. An occupation is considered in demand when work opportunities are available and there is not a surplus of qualified applicants; and\n\n(c) At the time that the claimant applies for the waiver, the usual duration of the school or training course is no longer than two (2) years.\n\n[72-1303A, added 2025, ch. 29, sec. 2, p. 104.]",

The pro rata share of wages paid for processing commodities raised by the farm operator compared to the total wages paid for processing all commodities shall determine whether a farm operator produced more than one-half (1/2) of the commodities processed.\n\n(c) This subsection is not applicable to services performed in commercial canning, freezing, or dehydrating or in connection with any agricultural, aquacultural or horticultural commodity after its delivery to a terminal market for distribution for consumption.\n\n(2) \"Custom farming\" means \"agricultural labor\" for the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(3) \"Farm\" includes stock, dairy, fish, poultry, fruit, furbearer and truck farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, hatcheries, ranges, greenhouses or other similar structures used primarily for the raising of agricultural, aquacultural or horticultural commodities, and orchards.\n\n(4) \"Unmanufactured state\" means retention of its original form and substance.\n\n(5) \"Terminal market\" means a place of business to which products are shipped in a sorted, graded, packaged condition, ready for immediate sale.\n\n[72-1304, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 4, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 4, p. 252; am. 1951, ch. 235, sec. 1, p. 472; am. 1971, ch. 142, sec. 1, p. 595; am. 1972, ch. 344, sec. 1, p. 998; am. 1973, ch. 257, sec. 1, p. 508; am. 1981, ch. 254, sec. 1, p. 544; am. 1982, ch. 326, sec. 3, p. 809; am. 1996, ch. 63, sec. 1, p. 185; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 4, p. 6; am. 1998, ch. 83, sec. 1, p. 292; am. 2021, ch. 243, sec. 1, p. 751; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 3, p. 106.]",

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, the director is authorized and directed to negotiate with the insurer to invest any interest, dividends, earnings, or other moneys accruing to the funds financing the employees’ retirement program with the insurer to purchase additional retirement benefits. The purchase of said additional benefits shall be contingent upon actuarial appraisals of the plan and shall be based on sound actuarial principles. Total retirement benefits to be provided under the program shall meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service for integration purposes.\n\n(e) The cost of past service, future service and disability pensions shall be calculated according to sound actuarial principles.

A vested employee, as provided in the insurance contract, who leaves his contributions in the plan will remain entitled to the pension purchased by the contributions made on his behalf, and all other privileges under the plan.\n\n(g) If an employee dies more than ten (10) years before his normal retirement date, all of his contributions plus interest will be returned to a previously-named beneficiary, subject to survivor benefits as provided in the plan. The following provisions of this subsection shall be subject to a contingency annuity option. If an employee dies on or after the date ten (10) years prior to his normal retirement date, it will be assumed that he retired on the first day of the month following his date of death, and his beneficiary shall receive, beginning on the assumed retirement date, one hundred twenty (120) monthly pension payments. The amount of monthly pension payable will be based on the credit accrued to that time and the employee’s assumed earlier retirement age. If death occurs after retirement but before one hundred twenty (120) monthly pension payments have been made, the monthly pension will be continued to his beneficiary until a total of one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments have been made.\n\n[72-1335, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 35, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 35, p. 252; am. 1959, ch. 29, sec. 1, p. 62; am. 1965, ch. 116, sec. 1, p. 223; am. 1971, ch. 136, sec. 49, p. 522; am. 1973, ch. 107, sec. 1, p. 189; am. 1994, ch. 210, sec. 1, p. 665; am. 1997, ch. 217, sec. 1, p. 639; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 45, p. 24.]",

This fund shall consist of all contributions collected pursuant to this chapter, payments in lieu of contributions, interest earned upon any moneys in the fund, any property or securities acquired through the use of moneys belonging to the fund, all earnings of such property or securities, moneys temporarily deposited in the clearing account, and all other moneys received for the fund from any other source.\n\n(2) Accounts and Deposits. The state controller shall maintain within the fund three (3) separate accounts: (i) a clearing account, (ii) an unemployment trust fund account, and (iii) a benefit account. Upon receipt by the director, all moneys payable to the fund shall be promptly forwarded to the state treasurer for immediate deposit in the clearing account.

Upon receipt, such moneys shall be deposited in the benefit account. Expenditures of moneys in the benefit and clearing accounts shall not require the approval of the board of examiners or be subject to any provisions of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody. The residual daily balance in the benefit account may be invested in accordance with the cash management improvement act of 1990, and earnings on those investments may be used to pay the related banking costs of maintaining the benefit account. Any earnings in excess of the related banking costs shall be returned to the state’s account in the federal unemployment trust fund annually. All warrants issued for the payment of benefits and refunds shall bear the signature of the director. Upon agreement between the director and state controller, amounts in the benefit account may be transferred to a revolving account established and maintained in a depository bank from which the director may provide for the payment of benefits and refunds. Moneys so transferred shall be deposited subject to the same requirements as provided with respect to moneys in the clearing and benefit accounts in subsection (2) of this section. Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the federal unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account or revolving account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned, may be utilized for the payment of benefits and refunds during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the director, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of this state’s account in the federal unemployment trust fund.\n\n(4) Reed Act Moneys. Reed act moneys credited to this state’s account in the federal unemployment trust fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section 903 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1103) may be requisitioned and used for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter. Moneys may only be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of a specific appropriation by the legislature which specifies the purposes for which such money is appropriated and the amounts appropriated therefor. Such appropriation is subject to the following conditions:\n\n(a) Such money may not be obligated after the close of the two (2) year period which began on the date of the enactment of the appropriation law; and\n\n(b) The amount which may be obligated at any time may not exceed the amount by which the aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of this state pursuant to section 903 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1103) exceeds the aggregate of the amounts used by this state and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of this state. For the purposes of this subsection, amounts obligated for administrative purposes pursuant to an appropriation shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into.\n\n(5) Reed act moneys requisitioned for the payment of benefits shall be deposited in the benefit account established in this section. Reed act moneys requisitioned for the payment of administrative expenses pursuant to a specific appropriation shall be deposited in the employment security administration fund, section 72-1347, Idaho Code, except that moneys appropriated for the purchase of lands and buildings shall be deposited in the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund in accordance with section 72-1348, Idaho Code.

(1) In the event the director determines that it is necessary to obtain advances from the federal unemployment account in the unemployment trust fund pursuant to title XII of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321), and that a request for such advances is authorized under section 1201 of the social security act, or under any other act of congress extending such authority, the director shall request the governor to make application to the secretary of labor of the United States for such advances.\n\n(2) The governor is authorized to make application to the secretary of labor of the United States to obtain advances pursuant to title XII of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321 et seq.). Funds so advanced shall be for the payment of unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n(3) Any amount transferred to the employment security fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States in accordance with this section shall be repaid from the employment security fund as provided in section 1202 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1322).\n\n(4) There is established in the state treasury the \"Federal Advance Interest Repayment Fund.\" This fund shall consist of all moneys collected pursuant to subsection (5) of this section and interest earned upon any moneys in the fund. All moneys in the fund are perpetually appropriated to the director for the payment of interest on any advance made to this state pursuant to title XII of the social security act, except that if, at the end of any calendar year, all advances and interest have been repaid, any remaining balance in the fund shall be transferred to the employment security fund. Interest charges due and payable pursuant to section 1202 of the social security act, may be paid by the director from the federal advance interest repayment fund. Such expenditures shall not be subject to any law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody, nor shall such expenditures require the approval of the board of examiners.\n\n(5) A federal advance interest repayment tax may be levied in accordance with the following provisions when required under paragraph (b) of this subsection:\n\n(a) On the first day of the third month of a calendar quarter, the director shall:\n\n(i) Estimate the interest payable on federal advances obtained under subsections (1) and (2) of this section;\n\n(ii) Estimate the amount of federal advance interest repayment tax receipts expected to be collected during the quarter for any preceding calendar quarter in which such tax was assessed;\n\n(iii) Add the amount in the federal advance interest repayment fund on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter to the estimate in paragraph (ii) of this subsection; and\n\n(iv) Subtract the sum obtained in paragraph (iii) from the estimate in paragraph (i) of this subsection.\n\n(b) If the remainder obtained under paragraph (iv) of subsection (5)(a) of this section is more than zero, each covered employer subject to this section may, at the director’s sole discretion, be assessed a federal advance interest repayment tax. Such tax shall be a percentage of the contributions payable under sections 72-1349 and 72-1350, Idaho Code, for the calendar quarter, but in no case shall be less than one dollar ($1.00). The percentage shall be determined by dividing the remainder in paragraph (iv) of subsection (5)(a) of this section by the estimated amount of contributions due and payable on wages paid during the quarter. The percentage shall be rounded up to the next one-tenth of a percent (0.1%).\n\n(c) The tax assessed shall be collected and paid in accordance with such rules as the director may prescribe. All such taxes collected shall be deposited in the federal advance interest repayment fund. Any such tax imposed in a calendar quarter shall be paid on or before the last day of the second month following the close of such calendar quarter. An extension of time for payment may be granted for good cause in accordance with section 72-1349(6), Idaho Code.\n\n(d) If any covered employer fails to pay such tax on or before the date on which they are due, such tax shall bear penalty at a rate of five dollars ($5.00) for each month or fraction thereof until paid; provided, that in no case shall the penalty exceed the actual amount of the tax due and payable. The date of payment shall be deemed the date of actual receipt by the director, or if mailed, the date of mailing.

(1) Benefits paid to employees of governmental entities and nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\nA group of such organizations or entities may elect, with the approval of the director, to act as a group in fulfilling the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(2) Liability for contributions and election of reimbursements. A nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall pay contributions under the provisions of section 72-1349, Idaho Code, unless it elects, in accordance with this section, to pay to the director an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits paid and the amount paid for extended benefits for which the department is not reimbursed by the federal government, for any reason including, but not limited to, payments made as a result of a determination or payments erroneously paid, or paid as a result of a determination of eligibility, which is subsequently reversed if said payment or any portion thereof was made as a result of wages earned in the employ of such organization or entity. Any sums recovered by the department from a claimant as a result of said payments shall be credited to the account of the nonprofit organization or governmental entity that reimbursed the fund for the payment of said benefits. Where such benefits are paid utilizing wages paid by two (2) or more employers, the portion of benefits to be repaid by the organization or entity shall be its proportionate share. This shall be computed on the basis of the relationship between wages utilized that were earned for services performed for such organization or entity and the total wages utilized in paying such benefits.\n\n(3) Any nonprofit organization or governmental entity may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions, provided it files with the director a written notice of election not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of any taxable year or within thirty (30) days after the date of the final determination that such organization or entity is subject to this chapter. Such election shall be effective for not less than two (2) full taxable years after the election is made, and will continue to be in effect until terminated. The organization or entity must file with the director a written notice of termination of such election not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective. The director may, in his discretion, terminate an election as provided in this section or extend the period within which a notice of election or a notice of termination must be filed.

Nonprofit organizations or governmental entities may elect to make payments in lieu of contributions in advance of actual billing for payment costs. Advance payments shall be made as follows: At the end of each calendar quarter, the nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall pay one percent (1%) of its total quarterly payroll unless the director determines that a lesser percentage will cover the cost of payment of benefits to the employees of said employer. For purposes of this section, the total quarterly payroll for school districts shall be computed based upon only those school districts that have elected cost reimbursement status. Such payments shall become due and payable within thirty (30) days following the quarter ending.\n\nAt the end of such taxable year, the director shall compute the benefit costs attributable to the employer as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The director will then debit the employer’s account with these costs. When payments exceed benefit costs, either the employer will be credited on subsequent benefit costs with the overpayment or, at the director’s discretion, the overpayment will be refunded to the employer. When payments are not sufficient to pay benefit costs, either the employer will be billed the additional amount necessary to pay such costs or, at the director’s discretion, the employer’s advance payment rate for the next taxable year will be set at a rate that will cover such costs.\n\n(5) Bond requirements. Any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may be required to obtain and deposit with the director a surety bond approved by the director. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the director on the basis of potential liability for benefit costs of each employing nonprofit organization. Such bond shall be in force for a period of not less than two (2) years, and shall be renewed not less frequently than two (2) year intervals for as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The director shall require adjustments to be made in the bond filed as deemed appropriate. When upward adjustments are required, the adjusted bond shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed. Failure by an organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments due, together with interest and penalties, as provided in section 72-1354, Idaho Code, shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was a liable organization.\n\n(6) Failure to pay timely. If any nonprofit organization or governmental entity is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions, the director may terminate such employer’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next taxable year, and such termination shall be effective for that and the next taxable year. Any nonprofit organization or governmental entity becoming delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same penalty provisions as any other covered employer as provided in this chapter.\n\n(7) Appeals procedure. Administrative determinations issued pursuant to this section shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed with the department in accordance with the department’s rules. Appeal proceedings shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.\n\n(8) In the payment of any payments in lieu of contributions, a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to fifty cents (50¢) or more, in which case it shall be increased to one dollar ($1.00).\n\n[72-1349A, added 1977, ch. 179, sec. 13, p. 483, am. 1978, ch. 112, sec. 6, p. 239; am. 1980, ch. 264, sec. 4, p. 683; am. 1982, ch. 326, sec. 7, p. 814; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 63, p. 46; am. 2006, ch. 38, sec. 1, p. 105; am. 2016, ch. 158, sec. 1, p. 429.]",

The professional employer shall keep separate records and submit separate quarterly wage reports for each of its clients. The professional employer shall pay contributions for its clients collectively using the professional employer’s contribution rate unless it elects to pay the contribution for certain clients individually in which instance the contribution shall be paid using the individual client’s contribution rate.\n\n(10) To report the wages and employees covered by the professional employer organization arrangement between a professional employer organization and client, professional employer organizations and their clients shall make reports to the department in one (1) of the following ways, subject to any conditions in rules promulgated by the department:\n\n(a) Report the workers included in the professional employer organization arrangement under the employer account number of the professional employer organization and transfer the rating of the client to the professional employer organization; or\n\n(b) Report the workers included in the professional employer organization arrangement under the employer account number of the client without an experience rating transfer.\n\n(11) As between a professional employer and its client, the professional employer company shall be deemed to be the interested party for purposes of section 72-1323, Idaho Code, and all proceedings to determine rights to benefits under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(12) The provisions of this section do not apply to an entity that provides temporary workers on a temporary help basis, provided that the entity is liable as the employer for all payments due under the provisions of this chapter as a result of wages paid to those temporary workers.\n\n(13) When a professional employer assigns workers to only one (1) client and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable presumption that the client entered into a professional employer arrangement to avoid calculation of the proper taxable wage rate. If the professional employer fails to rebut this presumption, the director, pursuant to section 72-1353, Idaho Code, shall issue an administrative determination of coverage holding the client to be the covered employer for purposes of this chapter.\n\n(14) Whenever a client ceases to pay wages, such client shall be subject to termination of its employer account and experience rating records in the same manner as any other employer, in accordance with the provisions of sections 72-1351 and 72-1352, Idaho Code. If a client that has ceased to pay wages subsequently becomes subject to this chapter because it resumes paying wages, it will be assigned the appropriate experience rate in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1351, Idaho Code.\n\n(15) Whenever a professional employer arrangement is entered, the separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve shall be transferred to the professional employer for the purpose of determining the professional employer’s contribution rate to be paid on behalf of the client. Upon the expiration or termination of the professional employer arrangement, so much of the professional employer’s separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve as is attributable to the client shall be transferred to the terminating client for the purpose of determining the client’s subsequent rate of contribution. In the event the professional employer elects to pay the client’s contribution separately as provided in subsection (9) of this section, then the client’s experience factors of payroll and reserve shall remain with the client employer for the duration of the professional employer arrangement.\n\n[(72-1349B), added 1977, ch. 179, sec. 14, p. 486; am. 1978, ch. 112, sec. 7, p. 243; am. 1982, ch. 326, sec. 8, p. 817; am. and redesig. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 65, p. 49; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 21, p. 123.]",

(1) In addition to the definition provided in section 72-1315, Idaho Code, the term \"covered employer\" shall also include any Indian tribe for which service in covered employment is performed.\n\n(2) In addition to the definition provided in section 72-1316, Idaho Code, the term \"covered employment\" shall also include service performed in the employ of an Indian tribe as defined in section 3306(u) of the federal unemployment tax act (FUTA), provided such service is excluded from \"employment\" as defined in FUTA solely by reason of section 3306(c)(7), FUTA, and is not otherwise excluded from covered employment under this chapter. For purposes of this section, the exemptions from covered employment in sections 72-1316A(5) and (9), Idaho Code, shall be applicable to services performed in the employ of an Indian tribe.\n\n(3) Benefits based on service in covered employment as that term is defined in this section, shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service under this chapter.\n\n(4) Indian tribes, or tribal units meaning subdivisions, subsidiaries or business enterprises wholly owned by such Indian tribe, subject to this chapter shall pay contributions under the same terms and conditions as all other covered employers unless the tribe elects to pay into the state unemployment fund amounts equal to the amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe.\n\n(a) Indian tribes electing to make payments in lieu of contributions shall make such election in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in section 72-1349A, Idaho Code, pertaining to nonprofit organizations and governmental entities subject to this chapter. Indian tribes shall determine if reimbursement for benefits paid will be elected by the tribe as a whole, by individual tribal units, or by combinations of individual tribal units.\n\n(b) Indian tribes or tribal units shall be billed for the full amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe or tribal unit on the same basis as other employing units that have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(c) At the discretion of the director, any Indian tribe or tribal unit that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may be required to obtain and deposit with the director a surety bond approved by the director. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the director based on the employing entity’s potential liability for benefit costs. Such bond shall be in force for a period of not less than two (2) years, and shall be renewed not less frequently than two (2) year intervals for as long as the Indian tribe or tribal unit continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The director may require adjustments to be made in the bond filed. When upward adjustments are required, the adjusted bond shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed. Failure by an Indian tribe or tribal unit covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments due, together with interest and penalties as provided in section 72-1354, Idaho Code, shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was a liable organization.\n\n(5) Failure of the Indian tribe or tribal unit to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, within ninety (90) days of receipt of the bill shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions as described in subsection (4) of this section, for the following tax year unless payment in full is received before contribution rates for the next tax year are computed.\n\n(a) Any Indian tribe that loses the option to make payments in lieu of contributions due to late payment or nonpayment as described in this subsection (5) of this section, shall have such option reinstated if, after a period of one (1) year, all contributions have been made timely, provided no contributions, payments in lieu of contributions for benefits paid, penalties or interest remain outstanding.\n\n(b) Failure of the Indian tribe or any tribal unit thereof to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, after all collection activities deemed necessary by the director have been exhausted, shall cause services performed for such tribe to not be treated as \"covered employment\" for purposes of subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(c) The director may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under paragraph (b) of this subsection, may have services performed for such tribe again included as \"covered employment\" for purposes of subsection (2) of this section, if all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties and interest have been paid.\n\n(6) Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to Indian tribes and their tribal units shall include information that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time frame:\n\n(a) Shall cause the Indian tribe to be liable for taxes under the federal unemployment tax act;\n\n(b) Shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions; and\n\n(c) Could cause the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of \"covered employer\" as provided in subsection (1) of this section, and services in the employ of the Indian tribe as provided in subsection (2) of this section, to be excepted from \"covered employment.\"\n\n(7) An Indian tribe and its tribal units shall be jointly and severally liable for all payments due under this chapter, including assessments of interest and penalties.\n\n(8) Extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of an Indian tribe and not reimbursed by the federal government shall be financed in their entirety by such Indian tribe or tribal unit.\n\n(9) If an Indian tribe fails to make payments required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalty, within ninety (90) days of a final notice of delinquency, or fails to timely file a required bond, the director shall immediately notify the United States internal revenue service and the United States department of labor.\n\n[72-1349C, added 2002, ch. 45, sec. 1, p. 99.]",

(1) All remuneration for personal services as defined in section 72-1328, Idaho Code, equal to the average annual wage in covered employment for the penultimate calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount of taxable wage base specified in the federal unemployment tax act, whichever is higher, shall be the taxable wage base for purposes of this chapter. For the purpose of determining the taxable wage base under this chapter, the average annual wage is computed by dividing that calendar year’s total wages in covered employment, excluding state government and cost reimbursement employers, by the average number of workers in covered employment for that calendar year as derived from data reported to the department by covered employers.\n\n(2) Prior to December 31 of each year, the director shall determine the taxable wage rates for the following calendar year for all covered employers, except cost reimbursement employers, in accordance with this section. If the desired fund size multiplier set forth in subsection (3) of this section is revised with an effective date that is prior to January 1 of the following year, the director shall issue adjusted taxable wage rates as soon as practicable and in accordance with the revised multiplier’s effective date. Employers shall receive a credit against future taxes under this act for any overpayments resulting from tax payments made before the amended taxable wage rates are adjusted.\n\n(3) An average high-cost ratio shall be determined by calculating the average of the three (3) highest benefit cost rates in the twenty (20) year period ending with the preceding year. For the purposes of this section, the \"benefit cost rate\" is the total annual benefits paid, including the state’s share of extended benefits but excluding the federal share of extended benefits and cost-reimbursable benefits, divided by the total annual covered wages excluding cost-reimbursable wages. The resulting average high-cost ratio is multiplied by the desired fund size multiplier, and the result, for the purposes of this section, is referred to as the \"average high-cost multiple\" (AHCM). The desired fund size multiplier shall decrease from one and three-tenths (1.3) to one and two-tenths (1.2) on and after January 1, 2024.\n\n(4) The fund balance ratio shall be determined by dividing the actual balance of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, and the reserve fund, section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, on September 30 of the current calendar year by the wages paid by all covered employers in Idaho, except cost-reimbursement employers, in the preceding calendar year.\n\n(5) The base tax rate shall be determined as follows:\n\n(a) Divide the fund balance ratio by the AHCM;\n\n(b) Subtract the quotient obtained from the calculation in paragraph (a) of this subsection from the number two (2);\n\n(c) Multiply the remainder obtained from the calculation in paragraph (b) of this subsection by two and one-tenth percent (2.1%). The product obtained from this calculation shall equal the base tax rate, provided that the base tax rate shall not be less than six-tenths percent (0.6%) and shall not exceed three and four-tenths percent (3.4%).\n\n(6) The base tax rate calculated in accordance with subsection (5) of this section shall be used to determine the taxable wage rate effective the following calendar year for all covered employers except cost-reimbursement employers as provided in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, except that the base tax rate for calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall be equal to the base tax rate calculated for calendar year 2021.\n\n(7) Table of rate classes, tax factors and minimum and maximum taxable wage rates:\n\nCumulative Taxable Payroll LimitsEligible EmployersMore ThanEqual toMinimumMaximum(% ofor Less ThanTaxableTaxableRateTaxable(% of TaxableTaxWageWageClassPayroll)Payroll)FactorRateRate1—120.28570.180%0.960%212240.47620.300%1.600%324360.57140.360%1.920%436480.66670.420%2.240%548600.76190.480%2.560%660720.85710.540%2.880%772—0.95240.600%3.200%\n\nCumulative Taxable Payroll Limits\n\nEligible Employers\n\nor Less Than\n\n(% of Taxable\n\nStandard-Rated EmployersMinimumMaximumTaxableTaxableTaxWageWageFactorRateRate1.0001.000%3.4%\n\nStandard-Rated Employers\n\nCumulative Taxable Payroll LimitsDeficit EmployersMore ThanEqual toMinimumMaximum(% ofor Less ThanTaxableTaxableRateTaxable(% of TaxableTaxWageWageClassPayroll)Payroll)FactorRateRate-1—301.71431.080%4.800%-230501.90481.200%5.200%-350652.09521.320%5.600%-465802.28571.440%6.000%-580952.66671.680%6.400%-695—2.66675.400%6.800%\n\nCumulative Taxable Payroll Limits\n\nDeficit Employers\n\nor Less Than\n\n(% of Taxable\n\n(8) Each covered employer, except cost-reimbursement employers, will be assigned a taxable wage rate and a contribution rate as follows:\n\n(a) Each employer, except standard-rated employers, will be assigned to one (1) of the rate classes for eligible and deficit employers provided in subsection (7) of this section based on the employer’s experience as determined under the provisions of sections 72-1319, 72-1319A, 72-1351 and 72-1351A, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) For each rate class provided in subsection (7) of this section, the department will multiply the base tax rate determined in accordance with subsection (5) of this section by the tax factor listed for that rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The product obtained from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate for employers assigned to that rate class, provided that the taxable wage rate shall not be less than the minimum taxable wage rate assigned to that rate class and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate assigned to that rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(c) For standard-rated employers, the department will multiply the base tax rate determined in accordance with subsection (5) of this section by the tax factor listed for standard-rated employers in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The product obtained from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate for standard-rated employers, provided that the taxable wage rate shall not be less than the minimum taxable wage rate assigned to standard-rated employers and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate assigned to standard-rated employers in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(d) Deficit employers who have been assigned a taxable wage rate from deficit rate class 6 will be assigned contribution rates equal to their taxable wage rate.\n\n(e) All other eligible, standard-rated, and deficit employers will be assigned contribution rates equal to ninety-seven percent (97%) of their taxable wage rate. Provided however, that for each calendar year a reserve tax is imposed pursuant to section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, the contribution rates for employers assigned contribution rates pursuant to this paragraph shall be eighty percent (80%) of their taxable wage rate.\n\n(9) Each employer shall be notified of his taxable wage rate as determined for any calendar year pursuant to this section and section 72-1351, Idaho Code. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer, unless within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, the employer files an application for redetermination, setting forth his reasons therefor. Reconsideration shall be limited to transactions occurring subsequent to any previous determination that has become final. The employer shall be promptly notified of the redetermination, which shall become final unless an appeal is filed within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code.

(1) Subject to the other provisions of this chapter, each eligible and deficit employer’s, except cost reimbursement employers, taxable wage rate shall be determined in the manner set forth in this subsection for each calendar year:\n\n(a)(i) Each eligible employer shall be given an \"experience factor\" which shall be the ratio of excess of contributions over benefits paid on the employer’s account since December 31, 1939, to his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dollar amount for the four (4) fiscal years immediately preceding the computation date, except that when an employer first becomes eligible, his \"experience factor\" will be computed on his average annual taxable payroll for the two (2) fiscal years or more, but not to exceed four (4) fiscal years, immediately preceding the computation date. The computation of such \"experience factor\" shall be to six (6) decimal places.\n\n(ii) Each deficit employer shall be given a \"deficit experience factor\" which shall be the ratio of excess of benefits paid on the employer’s account over contributions since December 31, 1939, to his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dollar amount for one (1) or more fiscal years, but not to exceed four (4) fiscal years, for which he had covered employment ending on the computation date; provided, however, that any employer who, on any computation date has a \"deficit experience factor\" for the period immediately preceding such computation date but who has filed all reports, paid all contributions and penalties due on or before the cutoff date, and has during the last four (4) fiscal years paid contributions at a rate of not less than the standard rate applicable for each such year and in excess of benefits charged to his experience rating account during such years, shall have any balance of benefits charged to his account, which on the computation date immediately preceding such four (4) fiscal years was in excess of contributions paid, deleted from his account, and the excess benefits so deleted shall not be considered in the computation of his taxable wage rate for the rate years following such four (4) fiscal years. For the rate year following such computation date, he shall be given the standard rate for that year.\n\n(iii) In the event an employer’s coverage has been terminated because he has ceased to do business or because he has not had covered employment for a period of four (4) years, and if said employer thereafter becomes a covered employer, he will be considered as though he were a new employer, and he shall not be credited with his previous experience under this chapter for the purpose of computing any future \"experience factor.\"\n\n(iv) Benefits paid to a claimant whose employment terminated because the claimant’s employer was called to active military duty shall not be used as a factor in determining the taxable wage rate of that employer.\n\n(b) Schedules shall be prepared listing all eligible employers in inverse numerical order of their experience factors, and all deficit employers in numerical order of their deficit experience factors. There shall be listed on such schedules for each such employer in addition to the experience factor: (i) the amount of his taxable payroll for the fiscal year ending on the computation date, and (ii) a cumulative total consisting of the sum of such employer’s taxable payroll for the fiscal year ending on the computation date and the corresponding taxable payrolls for all other employers preceding him on such schedules.\n\n(c) The cumulative taxable payroll amounts listed on the schedules provided for in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be segregated into groups whose limits shall be those set out in the table provided in section 72-1350(7), Idaho Code. Each of such groups shall be identified by the rate class number listed in the table which represents the percentage limits of each group. Each employer on the schedules shall be assigned a taxable wage rate in accordance with section 72-1350, Idaho Code.\n\n(d)(i) If the grouping of rate classes requires the inclusion of exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer’s taxable payroll, the employer shall be assigned the lower of the two (2) rates designated for the two (2) classes in which the halves of his taxable payroll are so required.\n\n(ii) If the group of rate classes requires the inclusion of a portion other than exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer’s taxable payroll, the employer shall be assigned the rate designated for the class in which the greater part of his taxable payroll is so required.\n\n(iii) If one (1) or more employers on the schedules have experience factors identical to that of the last employer included in a particular rate class, all such employers shall be included in and assigned the taxable wage rate specified for such class, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.\n\n(e) If the taxable payroll amount or the experience factor or both such taxable payroll amount and experience factor of any eligible or deficit employer listed on the schedules is changed, the employer shall be placed in that position on the schedules which he would have occupied had his taxable payroll amount and/or experience factor as changed been used in determining his position in the first instance, but such change shall not affect the position or rate classification of any other employer listed on the schedules and shall not affect the rate determination for previous years.\n\n(2) For experience rating purposes, all previously accumulated benefit charges to covered employers’ accounts, except cost reimbursement employers, shall not be changed except as provided in this chapter. Benefits paid prior to June 30 shall, as of June 30 of each year preceding the calendar year for which a covered employer’s taxable wage rate is effective, be charged to the account of the covered employer, except cost reimbursement employers, who paid the largest individual amount of base period wages as shown on the determination used as the basis for the payment of such benefits, except that no charge shall be made to the account of such covered employer with respect to benefits paid under the following situations:\n\n(a) If paid to a worker who terminated his services voluntarily without good cause attributable to such covered employer, with good cause but for reasons not attributable to such covered employer, or who had been discharged for workplace misconduct in connection with such services;\n\n(b) If paid in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1368(10), Idaho Code, and the decision to pay benefits is subsequently reversed;\n\n(c) For that portion of benefits paid to multistate claimants pursuant to section 72-1344, Idaho Code, which exceeds the amount of benefits that would have been charged had only Idaho wages been used in paying the claim;\n\n(d) If paid in accordance with the extended benefit program triggered by either national or state indicators;\n\n(e) If paid to a worker who continues to perform services for such covered employer without a reduction in his customary work schedule, and who is eligible to receive benefits due to layoff or a reduction in earnings from another employer; or\n\n(f) If paid to a worker who turns down an offer of suitable work because of participation in a job training program pursuant to the requirements of section 72-1366(8), Idaho Code.\n\n(3) A covered employer whose experience rating account is chargeable, as prescribed by this section, is an interested party as defined in section 72-1323, Idaho Code. A determination of chargeability shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed by an interested party with the department in accordance with the department’s rules. Appeal proceedings shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.\n\n(4)(a) An experience rating record shall be maintained for each covered employer. The record shall be credited with all contributions which the covered employer has paid for covered employment prior to the cutoff date, pursuant to the provisions of this and preceding acts, and which covered employment occurred prior to the computation date. The record shall also be charged with the amount of benefits paid which are chargeable to the covered employer’s account as provided by the appropriate provisions of the employment security law and regulations thereunder in effect at the time such benefits were paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant any covered employer or individual in his service a priority with respect to any claim or right because of amounts paid by such covered employer into the employment security fund.\n\n(b) Except those meeting the requirements of section 72-1349B, Idaho Code, each person or entity paying wages directly, or indirectly through arrangements in which payroll is consolidated for multiple persons or entities, shall maintain separate records and shall report the wages in accordance with this chapter.

Such one hundred eighty (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the director.\n\n(b) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, in any manner succeeds to, or acquires, part of the business of an employer who at the time of acquisition was a covered employer, and such portion of the business is continued by the successor, so much of the separate experience rating account of the predecessor as is attributable to the portion of the business transferred, as determined on a pro rata basis in the same ratio that the wages of covered employees properly allocable to the transferred portion of the business bears to the payroll of the predecessor in the last four (4) completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the date of transfer, shall, upon the joint application of the predecessor and the successor within one hundred eighty (180) days after such acquisition and approval by the director, be transferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining such successor’s liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who was not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date, become a covered employer as defined in this chapter.

      "text": "72-1351A. MANDATORY TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE RATING ACCOUNTS AND FEDERAL CONFORMITY PROVISIONS REGARDING TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE AND ASSIGNMENT OF RATES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following shall apply regarding transfers of experience and assignment of rates:\n\n(1)(a) If a covered employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to another employer, whether or not a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management or control of the two (2) employers, then the experience rating account attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom such business is so transferred. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated using the methods provided in section 72-1351(5)(b) and either (c)(i) or (c)(ii), Idaho Code. Whenever such mandatory transfer involves only a portion of the experience rating record, and the predecessor or successor employers fail within ten (10) days after notice to supply the required payroll information, the transfer may be based on estimates of the allocable payrolls.\n\n(i) For partial transfers of an experience rating record, the pro rata share of the experience rate to be transferred shall be computed based on the four (4) most recently completed quarters reported by the predecessor employer prior to the date of acquisition or change in entity.\n\n(ii) When a total transfer of experience rating record has been completed and the predecessor employer continues to have employment in connection with the liquidation of his business, the predecessor employer shall continue to pay contributions at the assigned rate for the period of liquidation but not beyond the balance of the rate year.\n\n(iii) In determining whether the ownership or management or control of a successor employer is substantially the same as the ownership or management or control of the predecessor employer, factors to be considered include, without limitation, the extent of policy-making authority, the involvement in daily management of operations, the supervision over the workforce, the percentage of ownership of shares or assets, and the involvement on boards of directors or other controlling bodies.\n\n(iv) A successor employer may use wages paid by the predecessor employer to arrive at the wage base for purposes of calculating taxable wages only when the experience rate of a predecessor employer has been transferred to a successor employer.\n\n(b) If, following a transfer of experience under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate shall be assigned to such account.\n\n(2) Whenever a person who is not a covered employer under this chapter at the time such person acquires the trade or business of a covered employer, the experience rating account of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such person if the director finds that such person acquired the business primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, such person shall be assigned the standard rate for new employers under section 72-1350, Idaho Code. In determining whether the trade or business was acquired primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the director shall use objective factors which may include but are not limited to the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.\n\n(3)(a) It shall be a violation of this section if a person:\n\n(i) Willfully makes any false statement to the department or willfully fails to disclose a material fact to the department in connection with the transfer of a trade or business or the assignment of a contribution rate or experience rate;\n\n(ii) Knowingly prepares any false or antedated report, form, book, paper, record, written instrument, or other matter or thing in connection with the transfer of a trade or business with the intent to submit it or allow it to be submitted to the department as genuine or true;\n\n(iii) Knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection (1) or (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate; or\n\n(iv) Knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation or an attempted violation of subsection (1) or (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate.\n\n(b) If a person commits any of the acts described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the person shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(i) If the person is a covered employer, a civil money penalty of ten percent (10%) of such person’s taxable wages for the four (4) completed consecutive quarters preceding the violation shall be imposed for such year and said penalty shall be deposited in the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.\n\n(ii) If the person is not a covered employer, such person shall be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Any such penalty shall be deposited in the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) Every person who willfully makes any false statement to the department or willfully fails to disclose a material fact to the department in connection with the transfer of a trade or business, or knowingly prepares any false or antedated report, form, book, paper, record, written instrument, or other matter or thing in connection with the transfer of a trade or business with the intent to submit it or allow it to be submitted to the department as genuine or true, or knowingly violates or attempts to violate this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate, or knowingly advises another person to act in a way that results in a violation or an attempted violation of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate, shall be guilty of a felony punishable as provided in section 18-112, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) For purposes of this section:\n\n(a) \"Experience rating account\" means the actual contribution, benefit and taxable payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the employer under this chapter. When a transferred experience rating account includes amounts due from the employer under this chapter, both the predecessor employer and the successor employer shall be jointly and severally liable for those amounts.\n\n(b) \"Person\" has the meaning given such term by section 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(1)).\n\n(c) A \"transfer of a trade or business\" occurs whenever a person in any manner acquires or succeeds to all or a portion of a trade or business. Factors the department may consider when determining whether a transfer of a trade or business has occurred include but are not limited to the following:\n\n(i) Whether the successor continued the business enterprise of the acquired business;\n\n(ii) Whether the successor purchased, leased or assumed machinery and manufacturing equipment, office equipment, business premises, the business or corporate name, inventories, a covenant not to compete or a list of customers;\n\n(iii) Continuity of business relationships with third parties such as vendors, suppliers and subcontractors;\n\n(iv) A transfer of goodwill;\n\n(v) A transfer of accounts receivable;\n\n(vi) Possession and use of the predecessor’s sales correspondence; and\n\n(vii) Whether the employees remained the same.\n\n(d) \"Trade or business\" includes but is not limited to the employer’s workforce. The transfer of some or all of an employer’s workforce to another employer shall be considered a transfer of a trade or business when, as the result of such transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred workforce, and such trade or business is performed by the employer to whom the workforce is transferred.\n\n(e) \"Violates or attempts to violate\" includes but is not limited to intent to evade, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure.\n\n(6) The director shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business for purposes of this section.\n\n(7) This section shall be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements contained in any guidance or regulations issued by the United States department of labor.\n\n(8) Administrative determinations issued pursuant to this section shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed with the department in accordance with the department’s rules. Appeal proceedings shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.\n\n[72-1351A, added 2005, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 36; am. 2008, ch. 44, sec. 4, p. 113; am. 2016, ch. 158, sec. 4, p. 437; am. 2025, ch. 28, sec. 3, p. 88; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 24, p. 131.]",

Such failure is due to compelling personal circumstances, provided that such failure does not exceed a minor portion of the claimant’s workweek and during which time the claimant does not refuse or miss suitable work that would have provided wages greater than one-half (1/2) of the claimant’s weekly benefit amount; and\n\n(iv) Living in a state, territory, or country that is included in the interstate benefit payment plan or that is a party to an agreement with the United States or the director with respect to unemployment insurance.\n\n(b) An action shall be considered an acceptable work search action pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection if it consists of one (1) or more of the following actions in any week:\n\n(i) Completing an online or in-person job search workshop;\n\n(ii) Completing a job search assessment, including but not limited to a personality, skills, or interests assessment;\n\n(iii) Completing career direction research or work such as a job search plan or job search counseling;\n\n(iv) Completing job search branding and marketing activities such as completing a resume, cover letter, master application, elevator pitch, LinkedIn profile, or uploading a completed resume to a job board allowing visibility to employers;\n\n(v) Completing an online or in-person mock interview;\n\n(vi) Taking a civil service exam;\n\n(vii) Submitting a resume to an employer;\n\n(viii) Completing and submitting a job application to an employer;\n\n(ix) Attending and completing an interview or skills test with an employer; or\n\n(x) Attending a job fair.\n\n(c) If a claimant who is enrolled in an approved job training course pursuant to subsection (8) of this section fails to attend or otherwise participate in the job training course during any week with respect to which he claims benefits or credit to his waiting period, the claimant shall be ineligible for that week if he was not able to work nor available for suitable work, to be determined as follows: The claimant shall be ineligible unless he is making satisfactory progress in the training and his failure to attend or otherwise participate was due to:\n\n(i) The claimant’s illness or disability that occurred after he had filed a claim and the claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2) of the classes available to him that week; or\n\n(ii) Compelling personal circumstances, provided that the claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2) of the classes available to him that week.\n\n(d) A claimant shall not be denied regular unemployment benefits under any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active search for work or refusal to accept work solely because the claimant is seeking only part-time work if the department determines that a majority of the weeks of work in the claimant’s base period were for less than full-time work. For the purpose of this subsection, \"seeking only part-time work\" is defined as seeking work that has comparable hours to the claimant’s part-time work experience in the base period, except that a claimant must be available for at least twenty (20) hours of work per week.\n\n(e) A claimant must seek work as directed by the department. A claimant must meet the requirements of the code to which the claimant is assigned. Failure to comply with work-seeking requirements will result in a denial of benefits. For the purpose of administering the work search requirements of this subsection and subsection (6) of this section, a claimant will be coded according to his attachment to an employer or industry, as follows:\n\n(i) Attached. A claimant who has a firm attachment to an employer, industry, or union, or who is temporarily or seasonally unemployed, and expects to return to his former job or employer in a reasonable length of time not to exceed sixteen (16) weeks, provided the claimant maintains reasonable contact with his employer. If during the sixteen (16) weeks the claimant returns to work temporarily for the job attached employer, the claimant’s period of job attachment will be extended by one (1) week for each week of verified full-time employment as defined by this chapter;\n\n(ii) Work-seeking. A claimant who possesses marketable skills in an occupation, but has no immediate prospects for reemployment, and whose employment expectations, wages, hours, and other conditions of employment are realistic in relation to the normal labor market supply and demand in his area of availability; or\n\n(iii) Approved training. A claimant who is assigned to a training course under the provisions of subsection (8) of this section.\n\n(f) A claimant must provide or be capable of obtaining a license or permit if required by law for performance of the work.\n\n(g) A claimant must apply for and accept a lower or beginning pay rate for employment if he has no prospects for a better-paying job in the locality.\n\n(h) A claimant who is regularly employed on a seasonal basis must be available for other types of work in the off-season to be eligible for benefits.\n\n(5)(a) The claimant’s unemployment is not due to the claimant voluntarily leaving employment without good cause connected with the claimant’s employment or because of the claimant’s discharge for workplace misconduct in connection with the claimant’s employment.\n\n(b) The requirement that good cause for a voluntary leaving of employment be in connection with employment does not apply and good cause is shown where a claimant demonstrates that:\n\n(i) The leaving was necessary to protect the claimant or any minor child of the claimant from domestic violence or the leaving was due to domestic violence that caused the claimant to reasonably believe that the claimant’s continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the claimant or any minor child of the claimant and the claimant made all reasonable efforts to preserve the employment;\n\n(ii) The claimant is a military spouse who voluntarily left the claimant’s most recent employment to relocate with the claimant’s spouse who, because of a permanent change of station orders, was required to move to a location from which the commute to the claimant’s most recent employment was impractical, but only if, before leaving, the claimant took reasonable actions to maintain the employment relationship through accommodation discussions with the claimant’s employer; or\n\n(iii) The claimant quit a temporary job for a permanent job or quit part-time employment for employment with an increase in the number of hours worked.\n\n(c) The following definitions apply to this subsection:\n\n(i) \"Domestic violence\" is as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho Code, and also includes the crime of stalking in the second degree pursuant to section 18-7906, Idaho Code;\n\n(ii) \"Military spouse\" means the spouse of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States stationed in this state in accordance with military orders or stationed in this state before a reassignment to duties outside this state; and\n\n(iii) \"Permanent change of station orders\" means the assignment, reassignment, or transfer of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States from the member’s present duty station or location without return to the previous duty station or location.\n\n(d) Good cause connected with employment exists when a claimant’s reasons for leaving the employment arise from the working conditions, job tasks, or employment agreement. If the claimant’s reasons for leaving the employment arise from personal or other matters unrelated to employment, the reasons are not connected with the claimant’s employment.\n\n(i) The standard of what constitutes good cause is the standard of reasonableness as applied to the average adult. Whether good cause is present depends on whether a reasonable person would consider the circumstances resulting in the claimant’s unemployment to be real, substantial, and compelling.\n\n(ii) A claimant who leaves a job because of a reasonable and serious objection to the work requirements of the employer on moral or ethical grounds and is otherwise eligible shall not be denied benefits.\n\n(iii) A claimant whose unemployment is due to his health or physical condition that makes it impossible for him to continue to perform the duties of the job shall be deemed to have quit work with good cause connected with employment.\n\n(iv) An individual who has continuing suitable work available and who voluntarily elects to retire or to terminate employment during a period of reorganization or downsizing shall be deemed to have voluntarily quit the employment for personal reasons.\n\n(v) The eligibility of a claimant discharged before a pending resignation has occurred for reasons unrelated to the pending resignation shall be determined on the basis of the discharge.\n\n(vi) If a claimant had given notice of a pending resignation but was discharged before the effective date of the resignation, both separations shall be considered. The following three (3) elements must be present for both actions to affect the claimant’s eligibility:\n\n1. The employee gave notice to the employer of a specific separation date;\n\n2. The employer’s decision to discharge the claimant before the effective date of the resignation was a consequence of the pending separation; and\n\n3. The discharge occurred a short time prior to the effective date of the resignation.\n\n(vii) Good cause for quitting employment may be established by showing the claimant was subjected to harassment that is unlawful pursuant to the provisions of chapter 59, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(e) If a claimant has resigned after receiving a notice of discharge or lay off due to a lack of work, but before the effective date of the discharge, both separations shall be considered. The following three (3) elements must be present for both actions to affect the claimant’s eligibility:\n\n(i) The employee was given notice by the employer of a specific separation date;\n\n(ii) The employee’s decision to quit before the effective date of the termination was a consequence of the pending separation; and\n\n(iii) The voluntary quit occurred a short time prior to the effective date of the termination.\n\n(f) A claimant who has been suspended without pay for an indefinite period of time and who has not been given a date to return to work shall be considered discharged.\n\n(6)(a) The claimant’s unemployment is not due to his failure without good cause to apply for available suitable work or to accept suitable work within seven (7) days of when it is offered to him, unless a condition specified in subsection (8) of this section applies or the job offered does not constitute suitable employment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (9) of this section. A claimant has the responsibility to apply for and accept suitable work. The longer a claimant has been unemployed, the more willing he must be to seek other types of work and accept work at a lower rate of pay. Failure to appear for a previously scheduled job interview without notifying the employer of the need to cancel or reschedule shall constitute a failure to apply for suitable work for that week.\n\n(b) The department shall establish an email address and web portal that allows employers to report suspected violations of this subsection. As part of its regular communication with employers, the department shall at least annually inform employers of the email address and web portal described in this subsection and the mechanism to report suspected violations.\n\n(c) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a good cause reason for not applying for available and suitable work or responding to an offer of suitable employment shall be found only if the claimant is ill, injured, or delayed by reason of an accident or medical emergency involving the claimant or a member of the claimant’s immediate family.\n\n(d) To have good cause to refuse to apply for or accept available suitable work because of personal circumstances, a claimant must show that his circumstances were so compelling that a reasonably prudent individual would have acted in the same manner under the same circumstances. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, good cause includes but is not limited to circumstances where:\n\n(i) The work would require the claimant to work on days contrary to his religious convictions;\n\n(ii) The claimant has reasonable, serious objections to the work or the workplace on moral or ethical grounds;\n\n(iii) The claimant has excellent prospects for more suitable work with his former employer or in his regular occupation;\n\n(iv) The claimant is unable to meet an employer’s restrictions on citizenship or residency;\n\n(v) The travel distance to available work is excessive or unreasonable. A claimant is ineligible if he fails to apply for and accept suitable work within a commuting area similar to other workers in his area and occupation; and\n\n(vi) The claimant cannot meet government requirements within a reasonable period of time.\n\n(e) A claimant shall be ineligible for benefits if:\n\n(i) The claimant causes an employer to withdraw an offer of suitable work or terminate the offer after the claimant has accepted it;\n\n(ii) The claimant fails without good cause to comply with reasonable, lawful requirements that are typical of certain occupations, such as a requirement that a worker be bonded;\n\n(iii) The claimant, after being laid off, fails to return to work on the date specified by the employer at the time of layoff or fails to respond to a callback after a layoff; and\n\n(iv) The claimant fails to report to the department when so directed, fails to follow explicit instructions for applying for available suitable work, or fails to report to work after accepting employment, without good cause.\n\n(f) A claimant must be available for and willing to accept suitable part-time work in the absence of suitable full-time work.\n\n(7) In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual, the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, morals, physical fitness, experience, training, past earnings, length of unemployment and prospects for obtaining local employment in his customary occupation, the distance of the work from his residence, and other pertinent factors shall be considered. No employment shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work or to hold himself available for work under any of the following conditions:\n\n(a) If the vacancy of the position offered is due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;\n\n(b) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are below those prevailing for similar work in the locality of the work offered;\n\n(c) If, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.\n\n(8) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits for any week due to an inability to comply with the requirements contained in subsections (4)(a)(i) and (6) of this section if:\n\n(a) The claimant is a participant in a program sponsored by title I of the workforce innovation and opportunity act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq., as amended) and attends a job training course under that program; or\n\n(b) The claimant attends a job training course authorized pursuant to the provisions of section 236(a)(1) of the trade act of 1974 or the North American free trade agreement implementation act.\n\n(c) The claimant lacks skills to compete in the labor market and attends a job training course with the approval of the director. The director may approve job training courses that meet the following criteria:\n\n(i) The purpose of the job training is to teach the claimant skills that will enhance the claimant’s opportunities for employment; and\n\n(ii) The job training can be completed within two (2) years, except that this requirement may be waived pursuant to rules that the director may prescribe.\n\n(9) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits under subsection (5) of this section for leaving employment to attend job training pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, provided that the claimant obtained the employment after enrollment in or during scheduled breaks in the job training course or that the employment was not suitable. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"suitable employment\" means work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual’s past employment and wages for such work are no less than eighty percent (80%) of the average weekly wage in the individual’s past employment.\n\n(10)(a) A claimant shall not be eligible to receive benefits for any week with respect to which it is found that his unemployment is due to a labor dispute; provided, that this subsection shall not apply if it is shown that:\n\n(i) The claimant is not participating, financing, aiding, abetting, or directly interested in the labor dispute; and\n\n(ii) The claimant does not belong to a grade or class of workers with members who are employed at the premises at which the labor dispute occurs and who are participating in or directly interested in the dispute.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section, \"labor dispute\" means a controversy with respect to wages, hours, working conditions, or right of representation affecting the work or employment of a number of individuals employed for hire that results in a deadlock or impasse between the contending parties.\n\n(c) A claimant may not be denied benefits because of a labor dispute if the dispute is not in any way directly connected with the factory, establishment, or premises at which the individual is or was last employed.\n\n(d) A claimant’s unemployment shall be deemed to be due to lack of work and not due to a labor dispute if it is shown that because of the labor dispute the employer’s business has fallen off to the extent that the employer can no longer utilize the services of the claimant due to the drop in business.\n\n(e) A claimant laid off because of lack of work from an employer where a labor dispute later occurred shall not be considered unemployed due to the labor dispute.\n\n(f) The period of ineligibility under this section applies for the whole of any week in which any part of a claimant’s unemployment is due to a labor dispute.\n\n(g) The act of picketing the work site of a labor dispute constitutes participation in the labor dispute, whether or not payment is made for such services.\n\n(h) Voluntary refusal to cross a peaceable picket line to work constitutes participation in a labor dispute.\n\n(i) Subsequent employment does not make the claimant eligible for benefits if his unemployment is still due to the labor dispute. As long as the claimant intends to return to the employer where the labor dispute exists, his unemployment shall be considered due to the labor dispute regardless of any intervening employment.\n\n(j) The period of ineligibility due to the labor dispute terminates at the end of the calendar week in which the labor dispute no longer exists. The termination of the dispute does not automatically make a claimant eligible for benefits.\n\n(k) The fact that an individual is a dues-paying union member alone does not constitute financing a labor dispute, and the fact that he is not a union member does not establish that he is not financing or participating in the dispute.\n\n(11) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits for any week with respect to which or a part of which he has received or is seeking benefits under an unemployment insurance law of another state or of the United States; provided, that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United States shall finally determine that he is not entitled to such unemployment compensation or insurance benefits, he shall not by the provisions of this subsection be denied benefits. For purposes of this section, a law of the United States providing any payments of any type and in any amounts for periods of unemployment due to involuntary unemployment shall be considered an unemployment insurance law of the United States.\n\n(12)(a) Any claimant who willfully makes a false statement or willfully fails to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits shall be ineligible for benefits.\n\n(b) If it is determined that a claimant has violated the provisions of this subsection, such claimant shall be disqualified from receiving benefits for a period of: fifty-two (52) weeks for the first violation; one hundred four (104) weeks for a second violation; and fifty-two (52) weeks multiplied by the total number of violations for a third or subsequent violation. The period of disqualification shall commence the week the determination is issued. The claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week credit and shall repay any sums received for any week for which the claimant received waiting week credit or benefits as a result of having willfully made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact. The claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week in which he owes the department an overpayment, civil penalty, or interest resulting from a determination that he willfully made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact. For purposes of disqualifications for subsequent violations pursuant to this subsection, violations occurring within a single benefit year may be counted as one (1) violation for purposes of enhanced penalties.\n\n(13) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits if his principal occupation is self-employment. A claimant who performs incidental work in self-employment shall show that self-employment does not interfere with his availability for suitable work and that he continues to seek suitable work.\n\n(14) A claimant who has been found ineligible for benefits under the provisions of subsection (5), (6), (7) or (9) of this section shall reestablish his eligibility by having obtained bona fide work and received wages therefor in an amount of at least fourteen (14) times his weekly benefit amount.\n\n(15) Benefits based on service in employment defined in sections 72-1349A and 72-1352(3), Idaho Code, shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service subject to this act.\n\n(a) If the services performed during one-half (1/2) or more of any contract period by an individual for an educational institution as defined in section 72-1322B, Idaho Code, are in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity, all the services shall be deemed to be in such capacity.\n\n(b) If the services performed during less than one-half (1/2) of any contract period by an individual for an educational institution are in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity, none of the services shall be deemed to be in such capacity.\n\n(c) As used in this section, \"contract period\" means the entire period for which the individual contracts to perform services, pursuant to the terms of the contract.\n\n(16) No claimant is eligible to receive benefits in two (2) successive benefit years unless, after the beginning of the first benefit year during which he received benefits, he performed service and earned an amount equal to no less than six (6) times the weekly benefit amount established during the first benefit year.\n\n(17)(a) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between two (2) successive academic years, or during a similar period between two (2) terms whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual’s contract, to any individual who performs such services in the first academic year (or term) and has a contract to perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second academic year or term or has been given reasonable assurance that such a contract will be offered.\n\n(b) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in any other capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid to any individual for any week that commences during a period between two (2) successive school years or terms if the individual performs such services in the first school year or term and there is a contract or reasonable assurance that the individual will perform such services in the second school year or term. If benefits are denied to any individual under this paragraph and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the educational institution for the second academic year or term, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this paragraph.\n\n(c) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, benefits shall not be paid nor waiting week credit given to an individual for wages earned for services for any week that commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performed the services in the period immediately before the vacation period or holiday recess and there is a reasonable assurance the individual will perform such services in the period immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess.\n\n(d) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services in any capacities specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection to any individual who performed such services in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"educational service agency\" means a governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing such services to one (1) or more educational institutions.\n\n(e) \"Reasonable assurance\" of continuing employment exists when an educational institution or service agency provides a written statement to the department confirming that the claimant has been given a bona fide offer of a specific job in the second academic period and explaining the circumstances of the offer. In addition, for such reasonable assurance to exist, the terms and conditions of the job offered in the second period must not be substantially less favorable than the terms and conditions of the job performed in the first period.\n\n(f) A claimant who initially was determined not to have a reasonable assurance of continuing employment shall subsequently become disqualified for benefits under this section when an educational institution or service agency gives the claimant such reasonable assurance.\n\n(g) A claimant seeking retroactive payments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection must make a request for the retroactive payment with the department no later than thirty (30) days after the beginning of the second school year or term or retroactive payment will not be made.\n\n(h) Employees of educational institutions hired under contract for the school term are considered unemployed between school terms even though they may receive their salary in twelve (12) monthly payments.\n\n(18)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services that substantially consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to participate for any week that commences during the period between two (2) successive sport seasons or similar periods if the individual performed services in the first season or similar period and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform such services in the later of such seasons or similar period.\n\n(b) No base period wages shall be used to establish a claim when substantially all services performed during the base period consist of participation in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so participate, for any week that commences during the period between two (2) successive sport seasons or similar periods if the individual performed such services in the first season or similar period and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform such services in the later of such seasons or similar periods.\n\n(c) For purposes of this subsection, \"reasonable assurance\" does not exist unless:\n\n(i) The claimant has a contract, either written or oral;\n\n(ii) The claimant offered to work and the employer expressed an interest in hiring the player for the next season or similar period; or\n\n(iii) The claimant expresses a readiness and willingness or intent to participate in the sport the following season or similar period.\n\n(d) Reasonable assurance exists if the claimant intends to pursue employment as a professional athlete the next season despite not having a specific employer to return to or a formal offer of employment.\n\n(e) An individual is deemed to have performed \"substantially all services\" in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so participate if ninety percent (90%) or more of the base period wages were based on such services.\n\n(19)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless the alien was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the services were performed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of sections 207 and 208 or section 212(d)(5) of the immigration and nationality act).\n\n(b) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine eligibility under this subsection shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.\n\n(c) A decision to deny benefits under this subsection must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(20) An individual who has been determined to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and to need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system established by the director must participate in those reemployment services, unless:\n\n(a) The individual has completed such services; or\n\n(b) There is justifiable cause, as determined by the director, for the claimant’s failure to participate in such services.\n\n(21)(a) A claimant:\n\n(i) Who has been assigned to work for one (1) or more customers of a staffing service; and\n\n(ii) Who, at the time of hire by the staffing service, signed a written notice informing him that completion or termination of an assignment for a customer would not, of itself, terminate the employment relationship with the staffing service;\n\nwill not be considered unemployed upon completion or termination of an assignment until such time as he contacts the staffing service to determine if further suitable work is available. If the claimant:\n\n1. Contacts the staffing service and refuses a suitable work assignment that is offered to him at that time, he will be considered to have voluntarily quit that employment; or\n\n2. Contacts the staffing service and the service does not have a suitable work assignment for him, he will be considered unemployed due to a lack of work; or\n\n3. Accepts new employment without first contacting the staffing service for additional work, he will be considered to have voluntarily quit employment with the staffing service.\n\n(b) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"staffing service\" means any person who assigns individuals to work for its customers and includes but is not limited to professional employers as defined in chapter 24, title 44, Idaho Code, and the employers of temporary employees as defined in section 44-2403(7), Idaho Code.\n\n(22)(a) A claimant who is otherwise eligible for regular benefits as defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho Code, shall be eligible for training extension benefits if the department determines that all of the following criteria are met:\n\n(i) The claimant is unemployed;\n\n(ii) The claimant has exhausted all rights to regular unemployment benefits as defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho Code, and all rights to extended benefits as defined in section 72-1367A(1)(f), Idaho Code, and all rights to benefits under section 2002 (increase in unemployment compensation benefits) of division B, title II, the assistance for unemployed workers and struggling families act, of the American recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, P.L. 111-5, as enacted on February 17, 2009;\n\n(iii) The claimant is enrolled in a training program approved by the department or in a job training program authorized under the workforce innovation and opportunity act; except that the training program must prepare the claimant for entry into a high-demand occupation if the department determines that the claimant separated from a declining occupation or has been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the claimant’s place of employment. For the purposes of this subsection, a \"declining occupation\" is one where there is a lack of sufficient current demand in the claimant’s labor market area for the occupational skills for which the claimant is qualified by training and experience or current physical or mental capacity and the lack of employment opportunities is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or the claimant’s occupation is one for which there is a seasonal variation in demand in the labor market and the claimant has no other skills for which there is current demand. For the purposes of this subsection, a \"high-demand occupation\" is an occupation in a labor market area where work opportunities are available and qualified applicants are lacking as determined by the use of available labor market information;\n\n(iv) The claimant is making satisfactory progress to complete the training as determined by the department; and\n\n(v) The claimant is not receiving similar stipends or other training allowances for nontraining costs.

(1) To be eligible an individual shall have the minimum qualifying amount of wages in covered employment in at least one (1) calendar quarter of his base period, and shall have total base period wages of at least one and one-quarter (1 1/4) times his high quarter wages. The minimum qualifying amount of wages shall be determined each January 1 and shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the product of the state minimum wage, as defined by section 44-1502, Idaho Code, multiplied by five hundred twenty (520) hours, rounded to the lowest multiple of twenty-six (26).\n\n(2) The weekly benefit amount shall be one twenty-sixth (1/26) of highest quarter wages except that it shall not exceed the applicable maximum weekly benefit amount. The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be established by the director, who shall determine the state average weekly wage paid by covered employers for the preceding calendar year and the maximum weekly benefit amount to be effective for new claims filed in the first full week of the following January and filed thereafter until a new maximum weekly benefit amount becomes effective under this subsection. The average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing the total wages paid in covered employment, including state government and cost reimbursement employers, for the preceding calendar year, as computed from data reported to the department by covered employers, by the monthly average number of workers in covered employment for the preceding calendar year and then dividing the resulting figure by fifty-two (52). The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be fifty-five percent (55%) of the state average weekly wage paid by covered employers for the preceding calendar year.\n\n(3) Any eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to his weekly benefit amount times the number of full weeks of benefit entitlement appearing in the following table based on his ratio of total base period earnings to highest quarter base period earnings. The maximum weeks of entitlement are based on a sliding scale of the official forecasted, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the state for a minimum of ten (10) weeks to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks depending on the unemployment rate in effect for the months of February, May, August and November as follows:\n\n(a) For any benefit week commencing in January through March of a calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of November;\n\n(b) For any benefit week commencing in April through June of a calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of February;\n\n(c) For any benefit week commencing in July through September of a calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of May; and\n\n(d) For any benefit week commencing in October through December of a calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of August.\n\nRatio of Total BaseFull Weeks of Benefit Entitlement Adjusted By thePeriodUnemployment RateEarnings to HighestQuarterEarningsAt LeastUp To8% or7% to6% to5% to4% to3% to2.9% orHigher7.9%6.9%5.9%4.9%3.9%Lower1.251.60101010101010101.60011.80111010101010101.80011.92121110101010101.92012.01131211101010102.01012.08141312111010102.08012.14151413121110102.14012.21161514131211102.21012.29171615141312112.29012.38181716151413122.38012.49191817161514132.49012.61201918171615142.61012.75212019181716152.75012.91222120191817162.91013.10232221201918173.10013.32242322212019183.32013.56252423222120193.56014.0026252423222120\n\nRatio of Total Base\n\nFull Weeks of Benefit Entitlement Adjusted By the\n\nUnemployment Rate\n\nEarnings to Highest\n\n(4) If the total wages payable to an individual for less than full-time work performed in a week claimed exceed one-half (1/2) of his weekly benefit amount, the amount of wages that exceed one-half (1/2) of the weekly benefit amount shall be deducted from the benefits payable to the claimant. For purposes of this subsection, severance pay shall be deemed wages, even if the claimant was required to sign a release of claims as a condition of receiving the pay from the employer. \"Severance pay\" means a payment or payments made to a claimant by an employer as a result of the severance of the employment relationship.\n\n(5) Benefits payable to an individual shall be rounded to the next lower full dollar amount.\n\n[72-1367, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 67, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 67, p. 252; am. 1951, ch. 236, sec. 7, p. 482; am. 1955, ch. 18, sec. 10, p. 20; am. 1957, ch. 53, sec. 1, p. 90; am. 1961, ch. 298, sec. 4, p. 539; am. 1967, ch. 117, sec. 10, p. 233; am. 1970, ch. 83, sec. 1, p. 201; am. 1971, ch. 341, sec. 2, p. 1328; am. 1973, ch. 114, sec. 1, p. 206; am. 1980, ch. 256, sec. 3, p. 669; am. 1980, ch. 264, sec. 10, p. 695; am. 1983, ch. 146, sec. 7, p. 396; am. 1987, ch. 317, sec. 2, p. 668; am. 1997, ch. 271, sec. 3, p. 795; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 85, p. 75; am. 2005, ch. 5, sec. 14, p. 27; am. 2011, ch. 113, sec. 1, p. 311; am. 2016, ch. 280, sec. 2, p. 775; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 29, p. 149.]",

The weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in his eligibility period shall be an amount equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to him during his applicable benefit year.\n\n(6)(a) Total extended benefit amount. The total extended benefit amount payable to an eligible individual with respect to his applicable benefit year shall be the least of the following amounts:\n\n(i) Fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of regular benefits which were payable to him under this chapter in his applicable benefit year;\n\n(ii) Thirteen (13) times his weekly benefit amount which was payable to him under this chapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year;\n\n(iii) Provided that the amount so determined shall be reduced by the total amount of extended benefits paid, or being paid, to the individual for weeks of extended unemployment in the individual’s benefit year which began prior to the effective date of the federal-state extended benefit period which is current in the week for which the individual first claims such benefits.\n\n(iv) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if the benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such individual would, but for the provisions of this section, be entitled to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received any amounts as trade readjustment allowances within that benefit year, multiplied by the individual’s weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.\n\n(b)(i) Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period, subsection (6)(a) of this section shall be applied by substituting:\n\n1. \"Eighty percent (80%)\" for \"fifty percent (50%)\" in subsection (6)(a)(i) of this section; and\n\n2. \"Twenty (20)\" for \"thirteen (13)\" in subsection (6)(a)(ii) of this section.\n\n(ii) For purposes of subsection (6)(b)(i) of this section, the term \"high unemployment period\" means any period during which an extended benefit period would be in effect if subsection (1)(b)(ii) were applied by substituting \"eight percent (8%)\" in subsection (1)(b)(ii)1. for \"six and five-tenths percent (6.5%).\"\n\n(7)(a) Beginning and termination of extended benefit period. Whenever an extended benefit period is to become effective in this state as a result of a state \"on\" indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be terminated in this state as a result of a state \"off\" indicator, the director shall make a public announcement.\n\n(b) Computations required by the provisions of subsection (1)(d) of this section shall be made by the director, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States secretary of labor.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, none of the benefits paid pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be charged to an employer’s account for purposes of experience rating.\n\n(9) Whenever a program of unemployment benefits becomes available that is financed entirely by the federal government, and such program will not allow payments to individuals who are entitled to extended benefits pursuant to this section, the governor may, by executive order, trigger off an extended benefit period as defined in subsection (1)(a) of this section in order to provide payment of such federal benefits to individuals who have exhausted their right to regular benefits. When the federal benefits are exhausted, or if the director determines that payment of extended benefits would be more economically advantageous to the state of Idaho, the governor shall, by executive order, trigger extended benefits on if the criteria of subsection (1)(b) of this section are otherwise met.\n\n(10) Until conformity with the federal-state extended unemployment compensation act of 1970 requires otherwise, the eligibility requirements in subsections (1)(j) and (3)(d) of this section are suspended. Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the eligibility requirements of section 72-1366, Idaho Code, applicable to claims for regular benefits shall apply in lieu of the suspended provisions.\n\n[72-1367A, added 1971, ch. 4, sec. 2, p. 6; am. 1975, ch. 127, sec. 1, p. 275; am. 1977, ch. 179, sec. 17, p. 495, am. 1978, ch. 112, sec. 11, p. 250; am. 1981, ch. 168, sec. 1, p. 294; am. 1982, ch. 326, sec. 11, p. 824; am. 1992, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 26; am. 1993, ch. 10, sec. 2, p. 31.; am. 1993, ch. 20, sec. 1, p. 73; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 86, p. 76; am. 2009, ch. 300, sec. 1, p. 891; am. 2011, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 306; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 30, p. 150.]",

(1) Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with this chapter and such rules as the director may prescribe.\n\n(2) Each employer shall post and maintain in places readily accessible to individuals performing services for him printed statements concerning benefit rights under this chapter which shall be provided by the department without cost to the employer.\n\n(3)(a) Following the filing of a claim pursuant to subsection (1) of this section the department shall:\n\n(i) Verify the claimant’s monetary eligibility pursuant to the requirements of section 72-1367, Idaho Code, and issue a determination. If monetarily eligible, the department shall establish the date the claimant’s benefit year begins, the weekly benefit amount, the total benefit amount, the base period wages, and the base period covered employers.\n\n(ii) If a claimant is monetarily eligible, the department shall verify, based on information provided by the claimant, whether the week claimed is a compensable week as defined in section 72-1312, Idaho Code. To receive benefits, a claimant must certify that each week claimed is a compensable week. In the event the week claimed is not a compensable week, the department shall issue a determination denying benefits and shall include the reasons for the ineligibility.\n\n(b) If the department has reason to believe at any time within five (5) years from the week ending date for any week in which benefits were paid that a claimant was not eligible for benefits, the department may investigate the claim and on the basis of facts found issue a determination denying or allowing benefits for the week(s) in question. If the department determines a claimant was not entitled to benefits received, the department shall issue a determination requiring repayment of the overpaid benefits, and assess any applicable penalties and interest. The determination shall contain provisions advising of the right to appeal the decision to the department within fourteen (14) days of the date of service.\n\n(c) Before a determination provided for in subsection (3) of this section becomes final or an appeal is filed, the department, on its own motion, may issue a revised determination. The determination or revised determination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal is filed by an interested party with the department. The appeal notice must be in writing, signed by an interested party, the appellant or representative, and contain words that, by fair interpretation, request the appeal process for a specific determination or other decision of the department. If an appeal is delivered personally, the personal delivery date will be noted on the appeal and deemed the date of filing. A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on the date received by the department, mountain time, or, if received on a weekend or holiday, the next business day. If mailed, the appeal shall be deemed filed on the date of mailing as determined by the postmark on the envelope containing the appeal. Where it appears any appeal to the appeals examiner, claim, or any other request or application was not filed within the time period prescribed for filing, it shall be dismissed on such grounds.\n\n(d) If a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, because of delay or error by the United States postal service or because of error on the part of the department, a determination was not delivered to the party’s last known address, or transmitted electronically in a manner approved by the department, within fourteen (14) days of the date of mailing or service indicated on the determination, the period for filing a timely appeal extends to fourteen (14) days from the date of actual notice.\n\n(4)(a) Upon appeal of a determination or revised determination, the director shall transfer the appeal directly to an appeals examiner pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, unless the director finds, in his sole discretion, that a redetermination should be issued affirming, reversing or modifying the determination or revised determination. The redetermination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal is filed by an interested party with the department in accordance with the department’s rules.\n\n(b) The director may, in his sole discretion, make a special redetermination whenever he finds that a departmental error has occurred in connection with a determination, revised determination or redetermination that has become final, or that additional wages of the claimant or other facts pertinent to such final determination, revised determination or redetermination have become available or have been newly discovered, or that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount of benefits fixed on the basis of nondisclosure or misrepresentation of fact. The special redetermination must be made within one (1) year from the date the determination, revised determination or redetermination became final, except that a special redetermination involving a finding that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount of benefits fixed on the basis of nondisclosures or misrepresentations of fact may be made within two (2) years from the date the determination, revised determination or redetermination became final.\n\n(5) All interested parties shall be entitled to prompt service of notice of written or digital communications from the department providing notice of an administrative or other deadline including, but not limited to, determinations, revised determinations, redeterminations, special redeterminations, decisions and letters from the department requiring a response within a specified time. Notice shall be deemed served if delivered to the person being served, if mailed to his last known address or if electronically transmitted to him at his request and with the department’s approval. Service by mail shall be deemed complete on the date of mailing. Service by electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date notice is electronically transmitted.\n\n(6) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, revised determinations, redeterminations, and special redeterminations, the director shall appoint appeals examiners. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals examiner shall affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination, revised determination, redetermination, or special redetermination involved, after affording the interested parties reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or may refer a matter back to the department for further action. The appeals examiner shall notify the interested parties of his decision by serving notice in the same manner as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The decision shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law and contain provisions advising of the right to appeal the decision within fourteen (14) days of the date of service. The appeals examiner may, either upon application for rehearing by an interested party or on his own motion, rehear, affirm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided, that such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed claim. All testimony at any hearing shall be recorded. If a claim for review of the appeals examiner’s decision is filed with the commission, the testimony shall be transcribed if ordered by the commission. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be allowed fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If any interested party to a hearing formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a witness whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly issue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable. Unless an interested party shall within fourteen (14) days after service of the decision of the appeals examiner file with the commission a claim for review or unless an application or motion is made for a rehearing of such decision, the decision of the appeals examiner shall become final.\n\n(7) The commission shall decide all claims for review filed by any interested party in accordance with its own rules of procedure not in conflict herewith. The record before the commission shall consist of the record of proceedings before the appeals examiner, unless it appears to the commission that the interests of justice require that the interested parties be permitted to present additional evidence. In that event, the commission may, in its sole discretion, conduct a hearing or may remand the matter back to the appeals examiner for an additional hearing and decision. On the basis of the record of proceedings before the appeals examiner as well as additional evidence, if allowed, the commission shall affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or revise the decision of the appeals examiner or may refer the matter back to the appeals examiner for further proceedings. The commission shall file its decision and shall promptly serve notice of its decision to all interested parties. A decision of the commission shall be final and conclusive as to all matters adjudicated by the commission upon filing the decision in the office of the commission; provided, within twenty (20) days from the date of filing the decision, any party may move for reconsideration of the decision or the commission may rehear or reconsider its decision on its own initiative. The decision shall be final upon denial of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration or the filing of the decision on reconsideration.\n\n(8) No person acting on behalf of the director or any member of the commission shall participate in any case in which he has a direct or indirect personal interest.\n\n(9) An appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from decisions and orders of the commission within the times and in the manner prescribed by rule of the Supreme Court.\n\n(10)(a) Benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with any decision allowing benefits, regardless of:\n\n(i) The pendency of a time period for filing an appeal or petitioning for commission review; or\n\n(ii) The pendency of an appeal or petition for review.\n\n(b) Such payments shall not be withheld until a subsequent appeals examiner decision or commission decision modifies or reverses the previous decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance with such decision.\n\n(11)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or necessarily involved in a determination, redetermination, decision of the appeals examiner or decision of the commission which has become final, shall be conclusive for all the purposes of this chapter as between the interested parties who had notice of such determination, redetermination or decision. Subject to appeal proceedings and judicial review by the Supreme Court as set forth in this section, any determination, redetermination or decision as to rights to benefits shall be conclusive for all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collateral attack irrespective of notice.\n\n(b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a decision or determination rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner, the industrial commission, a court, or any other person authorized to make such determinations shall have preclusive effect in any other action or proceeding, except proceedings that are brought (i) pursuant to this chapter, (ii) to collect unemployment insurance contributions, (iii) to recover overpayments of unemployment insurance benefits, or (iv) to challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this chapter or administrative proceedings under this chapter.\n\n(12) The provisions of the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, regarding contested cases and judicial review of contested cases are inapplicable to proceedings involving claimants under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n[72-1368, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 68, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 68, p. 252; am. 1951, ch. 104, sec. 15, p. 233; am. 1965, ch. 203, sec. 7, p. 456; am. 1972, ch. 344, sec. 5, p. 998; am. 1973, ch. 89, sec. 2, p. 146; am. 1977, ch. 300, sec. 2, p. 839; am. 1980, ch. 264, sec. 11, p. 696; am. 1982, ch. 296, sec. 1, p. 755; am. 1989, ch. 57, sec. 9, p. 89; am. 1993, ch. 119, sec. 4, p. 305; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 87, p. 82; am. 2001, ch. 37, sec. 1, p. 68; am. 2010, ch. 114, sec. 5, p. 236; am. 2016, ch. 126, sec. 1, p. 361; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 31, p. 156.]",

(1) Any person who received benefits to which he was not entitled under the provisions of this chapter or under an unemployment insurance law of any state or of the federal government shall be liable to repay the benefits, and the benefits shall, for the purpose of this chapter, be considered to be overpayments.\n\n(2) Civil penalties. The director shall assess the following monetary penalties for each determination in which the claimant is found to have made a false statement, misrepresentation, or failed to report a material fact to the department:\n\n(a) Twenty-five percent (25%) of any resulting overpayment for the first determination;\n\n(b) Fifty percent (50%) of any resulting overpayment for the second determination; and\n\n(c) One hundred percent (100%) of any resulting overpayment for the third and any subsequent determination.\n\n(3) Any overpayment, civil penalty and/or interest that has not been repaid may, in addition to or alternatively to any other method of collection prescribed in this chapter, including the creation of a lien as provided by section 72-1360, Idaho Code, be collected with interest thereon at the rate prescribed in section 72-1360(2), Idaho Code. The director may also file a civil action in the name of the state of Idaho. In bringing such civil actions for the collection of overpayments, penalties and interest, the director shall have all the rights and remedies provided by the laws of this state, and any person adjudged liable in such civil action for any overpayments shall pay the costs of such action. A civil action filed pursuant to this subsection shall be commenced within five (5) years from the date of the final determination establishing liability to repay. Any judgment obtained pursuant to this section shall, upon compliance with the requirements of chapter 19, title 45, Idaho Code, become a lien of the same type, duration and priority as if it were created pursuant to section 72-1360, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) Collection of overpayments and civil penalties.\n\n(a) Overpayments, other than those resulting from a false statement, misrepresentation, or failure to report a material fact by the claimant, that have not been repaid or collected may, at the discretion of the director, be deducted from any future benefits payable to the claimant under the provisions of this chapter. Such overpayments not recovered within five (5) years from the date of the final determination establishing liability to repay may be deemed uncollectible.\n\n(b) Overpayments resulting from a false statement, misrepresentation, or failure to report a material fact by the claimant that have not been recovered within eight (8) years from the date of the final determination establishing liability to repay may be deemed uncollectible.\n\n(c) The civil penalty assessed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall be paid as follows:\n\n(i) An amount totaling fifteen percent (15%) of the overpayment shall be paid into the employment security fund created in section 72-1346, Idaho Code; and\n\n(ii) Any additional amounts collected shall be paid into the employment security administrative and reimbursement fund created in section 72-1348, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) The director may waive the requirement to repay an overpayment, other than one resulting from a false statement, misrepresentation, or failure to report a material fact by the claimant, and interest thereon, if:\n\n(a) The benefit payments were made solely as a result of department error or inadvertence and made to a claimant who could not reasonably have been expected to recognize the error; or\n\n(b) Such payments were made solely as a result of an employer misreporting wages earned in a claimant’s base period and made to a claimant who could not reasonably have been expected to recognize an error in the wages reported.\n\n(6) Neither the director nor any of his agents or employees shall be liable for benefits paid to persons not entitled to the same under the provisions of this chapter if it appears that such payments have been made in good faith and that ordinary care and diligence have been used in the determination of the validity of the claim or claims under which such benefits have been paid.\n\n(7) The director shall have discretion to compromise any or all of an overpayment, civil penalty, interest, or disqualification assessed under subsections (1) and (2) of this section and section 72-1366(12), Idaho Code, when the director finds it is in the best interest of the department.\n\n[72-1369, added 1947, ch. 269, sec. 69, p. 793; am. 1949, ch. 144, sec. 69, p. 252; am. 1973, ch. 89, sec. 3, p. 146; am. 1980, ch. 264, sec. 12, p. 699; am. 1983, ch. 146, sec. 8, p. 397; am. 1986, ch. 24, sec. 3, p. 76; am. 1990, ch. 353, sec. 4, p. 955; am. 1993, ch. 181, sec. 2, p. 462; am. 1997, ch. 205, sec. 8, p. 618; am. 1998, ch. 1, sec. 88, p. 86; am. 1999, ch. 101, sec. 3, p. 321; am. 2005, ch. 5, sec. 15, p. 29; am. 2010, ch. 114, sec. 6, p. 239; am. 2013, ch. 103, sec. 2, p. 245; am. 2015, ch. 195, sec. 1, p. 603; am. 2021, ch. 243, sec. 5, p. 759; am. 2025, ch. 28, sec. 5, p. 97.]",
