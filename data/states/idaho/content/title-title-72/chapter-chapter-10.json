Weekly compensation payments shall be made at the end of each two (2) week period. No weekly compensation payments may be paid for the first week after the criminally injurious conduct occurred, but if total actual loss of wages continues for one (1) week, weekly compensation payments shall be paid from the date the wage loss began. Weekly compensation payments shall continue until the claimant has a reasonable prospect of being regularly employed in the normal labor market.\n\n(2) The commission may order payment of reasonable expenses actually incurred by the claimant for reasonable services by a physician or surgeon, reasonable hospital services and medicines, mental health counseling and care, and such other treatment as may be approved by the commission for the injuries suffered due to criminally injurious conduct. Payment for the costs of forensic and medical examinations of alleged victims of sexual assault performed for the purposes of gathering evidence for possible prosecution, after collections from any federal or federally financed third party who has liability, shall be made by the commission; provided however that payment for the costs of forensic and medical examinations of alleged victims under eighteen (18) years of age shall be made by the commission after collections from any third party who has liability. The commission shall establish a procedure for summary processing of such claims.\n\n(3) (a) The dependents of a victim who is killed as a result of criminally injurious conduct are entitled to receive aggregate weekly benefits amounting to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the wages received at the time of the criminally injurious conduct causing the death, subject to a maximum of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175) per week. Weekly compensation payments shall be made at the end of each two (2) week period.\n\n(b) Benefits under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be paid to the spouse for the benefit of the spouse and other dependents unless the commission determines that other payment arrangements should be made. If a spouse dies or remarries, benefits under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall cease to be paid to the spouse but shall continue to be paid to the other dependents as long as their dependent status continues.\n\n(4) Reasonable funeral and burial or cremation expenses of the victim, together with actual expenses of transportation of the victim’s body, shall be paid in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) if all other collateral sources have properly paid such expenses but have not covered all such expenses.\n\n(5) (a) Compensation payable to a victim and all of the victim’s dependents in cases of the victim’s death, because of injuries suffered due to an act or acts of criminally injurious conduct involving the same offender and occurring within a six (6) month period, may not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate.\n\n(b) The limitation of paragraph (a) of this subsection is subject to the further limitation that payments for mental health treatment received as a result of the victim’s injury may not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) unless the industrial commission finds extenuating circumstances. If the commission finds a victim to have extenuating circumstances as defined in section 72-1003, Idaho Code, the victim is eligible for payments up to the maximum benefit allowed under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

In a civil action in a court of this state arising out of criminally injurious conduct, the judge, on timely motion, shall direct the jury to return a special verdict indicating separately the amounts of the various items of damages awarded.
