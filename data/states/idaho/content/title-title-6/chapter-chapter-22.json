      "text": "6-2202. PURPOSE OF CHAPTER — DEFINITION OF CONSTITUTIONALLY BASED EDUCATIONAL CLAIM. Section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho provides: \"The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.\" The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism for adjudicating the performance of that duty when there are allegations that public schools do not provide educational services that they are required to provide as part of a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools. In this chapter, a constitutionally based educational claim is defined as a claim that public schools are not providing educational services that they are required to provide under section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho, and constitutionally required educational services are defined as the educational services that must be provided under section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho. In particular, this chapter provides procedures for adjudicating constitutionally based educational claims and administrative and judicial remedies to be implemented when public schools in a specific local school district are not providing constitutionally required educational services as part of a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools that has been established by the legislature. It is the policy of this chapter whenever possible that constitutionally based educational claims shall be settled locally through consent agreements or plans proposed by local school districts and that state intervention in local school districts be a last resort.\n\n[6-2202, added 1996, ch. 258, sec. 1, p. 845.]",

These complaints may be known as patron complaints, and the persons who are plaintiffs may be known as patrons. The patron complaint must list with specificity the manner in which the patrons contend that the local school district is not providing constitutionally required educational services.

If the district court shall find that the defendant local school district is not providing all constitutionally required educational services, the district court shall then conduct further proceedings as necessary to allow it to make the following findings:\n\n(1) The local school district (a) does or does not offer educational or other services that are not constitutionally required, and (b) does or does not offer the constitutionally required educational services that it does offer in a manner that consumes more of the local school district’s resources than necessary to offer the constitutionally required educational services that it does offer.\n\n(2) If the local school district (a) offers educational or other services that are not constitutionally required, or (b) offers some of the services that are constitutionally required in a manner that consumes more of the local school district’s resources than necessary to provide the constitutionally required educational services that it does offer, there is or is not a manner that resources devoted to offering services not constitutionally required or that consume more resources than necessary may be redirected to offer services that are constitutionally required but are not being offered. In making this finding, the district court shall take into account any federal mandates with which the local school district must comply, and the local school district shall not be obligated to redirect its resources from complying with federal mandates.\n\n(3) The local school district (a) does or does not impose maintenance and operations tax levies, supplemental maintenance and operations tax levies, and school emergency fund levies up to the statutory maximum allowed by law without holding further elections, and (b) does or does not impose maintenance and operations tax levies, supplemental maintenance and operations tax levies, and school emergency fund levies in a total amount that equals or exceeds the sum of the maximum statutory maintenance and operations levy and maximum statutory emergency fund levy plus the simple average of all supplemental maintenance and operations levies of all the local school districts in the state.
