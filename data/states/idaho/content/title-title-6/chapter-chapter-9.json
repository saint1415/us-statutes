The governmental entity may refuse a defense or disavow and refuse to pay any judgment for its employee if it is determined that the act or omission of the employee was not within the course and scope of his employment or included malice or criminal intent.\n\n(4) A governmental entity shall not be entitled to contribution or indemnification or reimbursement for legal fees and expenses from its employee unless a court shall find that the act or omission of the employee was outside the course and scope of his employment or included malice or criminal intent. Any action by a governmental entity against its employee and any action by an employee against the governmental entity for contribution, indemnification or necessary legal fees and expenses shall be tried to the court in the same civil lawsuit brought on the claim against the governmental entity or its employee.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this act and not otherwise, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that any act or omission of an employee within the time and at the place of his employment is within the course and scope of his employment and without malice or criminal intent.\n\n(6) Nothing in this act shall enlarge or otherwise adversely affect the liability of an employee or a governmental entity.
