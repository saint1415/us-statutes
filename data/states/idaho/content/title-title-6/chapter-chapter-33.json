      "text": "6-3301. LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE. The legislature finds that the sport of bicycling is practiced by a large number of citizens of this state at mountain areas and also attracts a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Idaho. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in the sport of bicycling that should be understood by each bicyclist and that are essentially impossible to eliminate by the mountain operators, it is the purpose of this chapter to define those areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which mountain operators shall be liable for loss, damage, or injury and to define those risks that the bicyclist expressly assumes and for which there can be no recovery. Nothing in this chapter shall impact other defenses that may be raised by mountain operators against claims asserted by bicyclist.\n\n[6-3301, added 2020, ch. 329, sec. 1, p. 949.]",
