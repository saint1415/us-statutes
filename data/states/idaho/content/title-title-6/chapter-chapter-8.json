In any action in which the trier of fact attributes the percentage of negligence or comparative responsibility to persons listed on a special verdict, the court shall enter a separate judgment against each party whose negligence or comparative responsibility exceeds the negligence or comparative responsibility attributed to the person recovering. The negligence or comparative responsibility of each such party is to be compared individually to the negligence or comparative responsibility of the person recovering. Judgment against each such party shall be entered in an amount equal to each party’s proportionate share of the total damages awarded.\n\n(4) As used herein, \"joint tortfeasor\" means one (1) of two (2) or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\n\n(5) A party shall be jointly and severally liable for the fault of another person or entity or for payment of the proportionate share of another party where they were acting in concert or when a person was acting as an agent or servant of another party.

In the event that the court shall enter any such order, it shall make detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law explaining the reason for its action, the amount of any increase or reduction, and the basis therefore.\n\n[6-807, added 1987, ch. 278, sec. 6, p. 579; am. 1992, ch. 86, sec. 1, p. 270.]",
