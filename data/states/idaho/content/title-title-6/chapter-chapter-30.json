      "text": "6-3002. PURPOSE. The legislature finds that agriculture plays a substantial role in the economy, culture and history of Idaho. As an increasing number of Idahoans are removed from day-to-day agricultural experiences, agritourism provides a valuable opportunity for the general public to interact with, experience and understand agriculture. Inherent risks exist on farms and ranches, the elimination of which would diminish the agritourism experience. Uncertainty of potential liability associated with inherent risks has a negative impact on the establishment and success of agritourism operations.\n\n[6-3002, added 2013, ch. 177, sec. 1, p. 412.]",
