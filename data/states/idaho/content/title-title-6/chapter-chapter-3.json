When he continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, of the property, or any part thereof, after the expiration of the term for which it is let to him, without the permission of his landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be; but in case of a tenancy at will, it must first be terminated by notice, as prescribed in the civil code.\n\n2. Where he continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, without permission of his landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three (3) days’ notice, in writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount which is due, or possession of the property, shall have been served upon him, and if there be a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant. Such notice shall also notify the tenant that if a court enters judgment against him, then he will have seventy-two (72) hours, if he is a residential tenant, and seven (7) days, or longer if granted by the court, if he is a commercial tenant or a tenant with a tract of land five (5) acres or more, to remove his belongings from the premises before the landlord may remove and dispose of such property pursuant to section 6-316, Idaho Code. Such notice may be served at any time within one (1) year after the rent becomes due. In all cases of tenancy upon agricultural lands, where the tenant has held over and retained possession for more than sixty (60) days after the expiration of his term without any demand of possession or notice to quit by the landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, he shall be deemed to be holding by permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, and shall be entitled to hold under the terms of the lease for another full year, and shall not be guilty of an unlawful detainer during said year, and such holding over for the period aforesaid shall be taken and construed as a consent on the part of a tenant to hold for another year.\n\n3. Where he continues in possession in person, or by subtenants, after a neglect or failure to perform other conditions or covenants of the lease or agreement under which the property is held, including any covenant not to assign or sublet, than the one for payment of rent, and three (3) days’ notice, in writing, requiring the performance of such conditions or covenants, or the possession of the property, shall have been served upon him, and if there be a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant. Within three (3) days after the service of the notice, the tenant, or any subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, or any mortgagee of the term, or other person interested in its continuance, may perform the conditions or covenants of the lease, or pay the stipulated rent, as the case may be, and thereby save the lease from forfeiture: provided, if the covenants and conditions of the lease, violated by the lessee, cannot afterward be performed, then no notice, as last prescribed herein, need be given to said lessee or his subtenant demanding the performance of the violated covenant or conditions of the lease. A tenant may take proceedings similar to those prescribed in this chapter, to obtain possession of premises let to an undertenant, in case of his unlawful detention of the premises underlet to him.\n\n4. A tenant or subtenant, assigning or subletting, or committing waste upon, the demised premises contrary to the covenants of his lease, thereby terminates the lease, and the landlord, or his successor in estate, shall, upon service of three (3) days’ notice to quit upon the person or persons in possession, be entitled to restitution of possession of such demised premises under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n5.

(1) The legislature finds that the right to exclude others from entering, and the right to direct others to immediately vacate, residential real property are the most important real property rights. The legislature further finds that existing remedies regarding unauthorized persons who unlawfully remain on residential real property fail to adequately protect the rights of the property owner and fail to adequately discourage theft and vandalism. The intent of this section is to quickly restore possession of residential real property to the lawful owner of the property when the property is being unlawfully occupied and to thereby preserve property rights while limiting the opportunity for criminal activity.\n\n(2) A property owner or the owner’s authorized agent may request from the sheriff of the county in which the property is located the immediate removal of a person or persons unlawfully occupying a residential dwelling pursuant to this section if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The requesting person is the property owner or authorized agent of the property owner;\n\n(b) The real property that is being occupied includes a residential dwelling;\n\n(c) An unauthorized person or persons have unlawfully entered and remain or continue to reside on the property owner’s property;\n\n(d) The real property was not open to members of the public at the time the unauthorized person or persons entered;\n\n(e) The property owner has directed the unauthorized person to leave the property;\n\n(f) The unauthorized person or persons are not current or former tenants pursuant to a written or oral rental agreement authorized by the property owner;\n\n(g) The unauthorized person or persons are not immediate family members of the property owner; and\n\n(h) There is no pending litigation related to the real property between the property owner and any known unauthorized person.\n\n(3) To request the immediate removal of an unlawful occupant of a residential dwelling, the property owner or the owner’s authorized agent must submit a complaint by presenting a completed and verified \"Complaint to Remove Persons Unlawfully Occupying Residential Real Property\" to the sheriff of the county in which the real property is located. The submitted complaint must be in substantially the following form:\n\nCOMPLAINT TO REMOVE PERSONS UNLAWFULLY OCCUPYING RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY\n\nI, the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the real property located at……, declare under the penalty of perjury that (initial each box):\n\n1….. I am the owner of the real property or the authorized agent of the owner of the real property.\n\n2….. I purchased the property on…..\n\n3….. The real property is a residential dwelling.\n\n4….. An unauthorized person or persons have unlawfully entered and are remaining or residing unlawfully on the real property.\n\n5….. The real property was not open to members of the public at the time the unauthorized person or persons entered.\n\n6….. I have directed the unauthorized person or persons to leave the real property, but they have not done so.\n\n7….. The person or persons are not current or former tenants pursuant to any valid lease authorized by the property owner, and any lease that may be produced by an occupant is fraudulent.\n\n8….. The unauthorized person or persons sought to be removed are not owners or co-owners of the property and have not been listed on the title to the property unless the person or persons have engaged in title fraud.\n\n9….. The unauthorized person or persons are not immediate family members of the property owner.\n\n10….. There is no litigation related to the real property pending between the property owner and any person sought to be removed.\n\n11….. I understand that a person or persons removed from the property pursuant to this procedure may bring a cause of action against me for any false statements made in this complaint, or for wrongfully using this procedure, and that as a result of such action I may be held liable for actual damages, penalties, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n12….. I am requesting the sheriff to immediately remove the unauthorized person or persons from the residential property.\n\n13….. A copy of my valid government-issued identification is attached, or I am an agent of the property owner, and documents evidencing my authority to act on the property owner’s behalf are attached.\n\nI HAVE READ EVERY STATEMENT MADE IN THIS PETITION AND EACH STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS PETITION ARE BEING MADE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY.\n\n…(Signature of Property Owner or Agent of Owner)…\n\n(4) Upon receipt of the complaint, the sheriff shall verify that the person submitting the complaint is the record owner of the real property or the authorized agent of the owner and appears otherwise entitled to relief pursuant to the provisions of this section. If verified, the sheriff shall, without delay, serve a notice to immediately vacate on all the unlawful occupants and shall put the owner in possession of the real property. Service may be accomplished by hand delivery of the notice to an occupant or by posting the notice on the front door or entrance of the dwelling. The sheriff shall also attempt to verify the identities of all persons occupying the dwelling and note the identities on the return of service. If appropriate, the sheriff may arrest any person found in the dwelling for trespass, outstanding warrants, or any other legal cause.\n\n(5) The sheriff is entitled to the same fee for service of the notice to immediately vacate as if the sheriff were serving a writ of possession. After the sheriff serves the notice to immediately vacate, the property owner or authorized agent may request that the sheriff stand by to keep the peace while the property owner or agent of the owner changes the locks and removes the personal property of the unlawful occupants from the premises to or near the property line. When such a request is made, the sheriff may charge a reasonable hourly rate, and the person requesting the sheriff to stand by and keep the peace is responsible for paying the reasonable hourly rate set by the sheriff. The sheriff is not liable to the unlawful occupant or any other party for loss, destruction, or damage of property. The property owner or the owner’s authorized agent is not liable to an unlawful occupant or any other party for the loss, destruction, or damage to the personal property unless the removal was wrongful.\n\n(6) A person may bring a civil cause of action for wrongful removal under this section. A person harmed by a wrongful removal under this section may be restored to possession of the real property and may recover actual costs and damages incurred, statutory damages equal to triple the fair market rent of the dwelling, court costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees. The court shall advance the cause on the calendar.\n\n(7) The provisions of this section shall not limit the rights of a property owner or limit the authority of a law enforcement officer to arrest an unlawful occupant for trespassing, vandalism, theft, or other crimes.\n\n[6-310A, added 2025, ch. 222, sec. 1, p. 1042.]",

Upon commencement of a rental agreement, the landlord shall verify that smoke detectors have been installed and are in good working order in the dwelling unit. The tenant shall maintain the smoke detectors in good working order during the tenant’s rental period. For purposes of this section, an approved smoke detector is a battery-operated device that is capable of detecting visible or invisible particles of combustion and that bears a label or other identification issued by an approved testing agency having a service for inspection of materials and workmanship at the factory during fabrication and assembly. If the landlord or the landlord’s assignee fails to install working smoke detectors, the tenant may send written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the landlord or the landlord’s assignee that if working smoke detectors are not installed within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the letter, the tenant may install smoke detectors and deduct the cost from the tenant’s next month’s rent. Smoke detectors purchased by the tenant and deducted from rent become the property of the landlord and shall not be removed from the premises.\n\nUpon filing the complaint, a summons must be issued, served and returned as in other actions, provided, however, that in an action exclusively for specific performance, at the time of issuance of the summons, the court shall schedule a trial within twelve (12) days from the filing of the complaint, and the service of the summons, complaint and trial setting on the defendant shall be not less than five (5) days before the day of trial appointed by the court.

Judgment may also be entered requiring specific performance for any breach of agreement showing by the evidence, and for costs and disbursements.\n\n(d) Before a tenant shall have standing to file an action under this section, he must give his landlord three (3) days written notice, listing each failure or breach upon which his action will be premised and written demand requiring performance or cure. If, within three (3) days after service of the notice, any listed failure or breach has not been performed or cured by the landlord, the tenant may proceed to commence an action for damages and specific performance.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to tracts of land of five (5) acres or more used for agricultural purposes.\n\n[6-320, added 1977, ch. 45, sec. 4, p. 81; am. 1994, ch. 418, sec. 1, p. 1308.]",
