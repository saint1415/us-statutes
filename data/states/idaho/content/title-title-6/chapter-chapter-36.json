Each recreational participant expressly assumes the risk of and legal responsibility for any injury to person or property that results from participation in recreational activities. Each recreational participant shall have the sole individual responsibility for knowing the range of the participant’s own ability while participating in a recreational activity in a state park and to heed all posted notes, cautions, and warnings. Recreational participants shall refrain from acting in a manner that may cause or contribute to the injury of persons or property. The responsibility for injury to person or property shall be solely that of the individual or individuals involved in such recreational activity and not that of the Idaho department of parks and recreation.\n\n[6-3601, added 2023, ch. 54, sec. 1, p. 206.]",
