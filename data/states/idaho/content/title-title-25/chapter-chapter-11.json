As used in this chapter, and elsewhere in the Idaho Code where applicable:\n\n\"Livestock\" means any cattle, horses, mules or asses.\n\n\"Transportation\" means the movement of livestock in any manner.\n\n\"Person\" means every natural person, firm, association, partnership, company business or corporation.\n\n\"Brand\" means one, either, or both of the following:\n\n(1) An identification mark, device or document prescribed by rules of the board that cannot be switched from one (1) animal to another without destruction or disfigurement of the mark, device or document. Any such mark or device, except for the location in or on the animal, shall be subject to the same restrictions, requirements, inspections, fees and penalties as the permanent identification marks described in the following paragraph (2).\n\n(2) An identification mark that is permanently affixed into the hide of a live animal on either side in any one of three (3) locations, the shoulder, ribs, or hip. The brand may be applied on the hide by either a hot iron, or as a freeze brand which involves applying intense cold to the skin of the live animal to change the color of the hair on the skin to create a clear brand. An acid brand means any such mark or brand that has been applied by the use of a chemical compound and when so used causes a scarlike tissue to form on the hide of a live animal. Acid brands are not valid for any type of brand inspection.\n\n\"Brand inspector\" means the state brand inspector, any authorized deputy or assistant brand inspector, or any other person authorized by the laws of the state of Idaho to make brand inspections.\n\n\"Brand inspection certificate\" means a certificate on a form adopted by the state brand board, listing the animals for which the certificate is issued, describing the animals listed thereon, listing the name and address of the owner of the livestock, the name and address of the new owner, the listing of the place of origin and of destination of such transportation, and such other information as may be required by the state brand board. Brand inspection certificates shall be of the following kinds:\n\n(1) An inspection certificate that is issued only when there is a change in ownership of the livestock, or when livestock is leaving the state, or when the livestock is to be slaughtered within ninety-six (96) hours.\n\n(2) An annual inspection certificate good only for the current growing or grazing season, and which authorizes the owner to transport the livestock within and without the state. An annual inspection certificate does not authorize the sale or transfer of an ownership interest in any livestock.\n\n(3) A seasonal grazing certificate good only for moving livestock from this state to another state for grazing, and to return some or all of that livestock to this state. The certificate shall be issued without charge if the brand inspector determines that an inspection of the animals is not necessary. If an inspection is made, the certificate shall be issued at one-half (1/2) the usual brand inspection fee, and the provisions of sections 25-232, 25-2505 and 25-2907, Idaho Code, shall not apply.\n\n(4) A lifetime ownership and transportation certificate which is valid only for horses, mules or asses, and which authorizes the owner to transport the horses, mules or asses within and without the state. A lifetime ownership and transportation certificate may be used for the sale or transfer of an ownership interest in horses, mules or asses, but immediately upon a change of ownership interest, the new owner must apply to the brand board for a new lifetime ownership and transportation certificate, and pay the required fees.\n\n\"Livestock auction sale,\" for the purpose of charging and collecting the minimum inspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) required by section 25-1160, Idaho Code, means and includes all public livestock markets chartered under the provisions of chapter 17, title 25, Idaho Code; means and includes any dispersal sale of livestock by a farmer, dairyman, breeder or feeder of livestock subject to brand inspection; and means and includes any sale of livestock by an association of breeders of livestock subject to brand inspection. The state brand board may, by regulation, include other private or public operations at which livestock subject to brand inspection is offered for sale within such definition.\n\n\"Written ownership transportation permit\" means a statement in writing of a form approved by the state brand board, which permit shall describe the livestock being transported, is signed and dated by the person in whose name the brand on such livestock is recorded in the office of the state brand inspector, and an acknowledgment authorizing the transportation of such livestock, within the state, listing the place of origin, place of destination of such transportation, the consignee thereof and his address, and such other information as may be required by the state brand board. An ownership transportation permit is not valid for a change in ownership of livestock, and is not valid to transport livestock outside of the state.\n\n\"Stock grower\" means any person owning any livestock in this state to be slaughtered for human consumption whether in this state or outside of this state, or any person engaging in the business of breeding, growing or raising livestock.\n\n[(25-1101) I.C., sec. 25-1401, as added by 1973, ch. 168, sec. 20, p. 339; am. 1988 & redesignated 25-1101, ch. 75, sec. 2, p. 112; am. 1991, ch. 71, sec. 1, p. 174.]",

(1) The maximum fee that shall be charged by the state brand inspector and his deputies for brand inspection shall be:\n\n(a) One dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) for each head of cattle;\n\n(b) Ten dollars ($10.00) for each head of horses, mules, and asses.\n\n(2) The minimum fee that shall be charged by the state brand inspector for brand inspection shall be:\n\n(a) An amount set by the state brand board, not to exceed forty dollars ($40.00), for each brand inspection certificate issued, whether for cattle, horses, mules, or asses, or a combination thereof. The minimum brand inspection fee shall apply only in those cases when a brand inspector must travel from his assigned duty post.\n\n(b) There shall be an equine farm service fee in an amount to be set by the state brand board, not to exceed fifty-five dollars ($55.00), for each case a brand inspector must travel from his assigned duty post to complete a brand inspection certificate for horses, mules, or asses, which fee shall be in addition to any brand inspection certificate or other written permit requested by the owner or owners of a horse, mule, or ass under any other provisions of law. Livestock auctions and feedlots currently approved by the Idaho state department of agriculture are exempt from the equine farm service fee.\n\n(3) The minimum fee for brand inspection services at any normally scheduled livestock auction sale is one hundred dollars ($100) per day and shall be paid by the livestock auction sale, whether or not the inspection fee received from the owners of livestock inspected equals the minimum fee. If the fees paid by the owners of livestock inspected at the sale exceed the minimum fee, the actual amount of fees collected shall be paid, rather than the minimum amount.\n\n(4) The fee for brand inspection services at any livestock auction sale that is not a normally scheduled livestock auction sale shall be:\n\n(a) Thirty-six dollars ($36.00) per hour for each hour that each brand inspector spends engaged in the performance of brand inspection services at the livestock auction sale;\n\n(b) A mileage rate as established by the state board of examiners per mile per vehicle for each mile that said brand inspector(s) must travel to and from the sale from his assigned duty post.\n\nThe minimum fee, not including mileage, shall be the actual hours worked, or seventy-two dollars ($72.00) per day, or the inspection fees as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, whichever is greater.\n\n(5) The state brand board may adopt a schedule of fees that are below the maximum fees and may thereafter review and adjust such fees annually at a regular and properly noticed meeting of the board held in the first calendar quarter, with said fees to be scheduled in an amount reasonably necessary to cover the cost of administering and enforcing the laws of the state of Idaho for brand inspection of livestock. The state brand board shall only adjust the fees to be collected under this section for this purpose alone, and in no event shall the fee for cattle brand inspections increase more than ten cents ($0.10) per head annually, while remaining below the maximum fees allowed by law. If the board determines fee adjustments are necessary, such adjustments shall take effect on July 1 of the same year, and notice of any fee increases shall be posted prominently on the front page of the brand inspector’s website. All such fees shall be paid by the owner of the cattle, horses, mules, and asses and credited to the state brand account.\n\n(6) All brand inspection fees, and all other fees required by law to be collected by the brand inspector, are due and payable at the time of inspection, but the brand board may, by rule, allow all of such fees to be paid on a schedule that requires payment at least monthly, after receiving a request for such delayed payment schedule and after such request is approved by the state brand inspector. The brand board may require a security deposit to ensure the prompt payment of all fees owed to the state. Failure to pay as required shall be cause for the brand inspector to file an action in the district court of the county wherein the inspection was made for the amount of all fees owed, plus all costs and reasonable attorney’s fees associated with the action plus interest at the rate specified in section 28-22-104, Idaho Code, on the amount owed from the due date.\n\n(7) Any brand inspector who must travel to investigate a possible violation of this chapter is entitled to a mileage rate, as established by the state board of examiners, per mile per vehicle for each mile that the brand inspector must travel to and from his assigned duty post, and thirty-six dollars ($36.00) per hour for each hour that each brand inspector spends engaged in the investigation. The minimum fee for each brand inspector, not including mileage, shall be the actual hours worked, or seventy-two dollars ($72.00) per day, or the hourly inspection fees, whichever is greater.\n\n(8) A fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be paid to the state brand inspector for each duplicate brand inspection certificate issued.\n\n[(25-1160) 25-1106A, as added by 1959, ch. 91, sec. 1, p. 203; am. 1969, ch. 190, sec. 1, p. 559; am. 1973, ch. 168, sec. 4, p. 339; am. 1975, ch. 23, sec. 1, p. 36; am. 1976, ch. 180, sec. 1, p. 652; am. 1977, ch. 183, sec. 4, p. 512; am. 1987, ch. 61, sec. 1, p. 109; am. 1988 & redesignated 25-1160, ch. 75, sec. 31, p. 125; am. 1993, ch. 122, sec. 1, p. 311; am. 1997, ch. 105, sec. 2, p. 247; am. 2000, ch. 80, sec. 1, p. 168; am. 2006, ch. 198, sec. 2, p. 613; am. 2019, ch. 157, sec. 2, p. 510; am. 2025, ch. 160, sec. 5, p. 777.]",
