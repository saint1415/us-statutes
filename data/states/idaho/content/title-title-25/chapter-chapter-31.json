It is to the interest of all the people that the abundant natural resources of Idaho be protected, fully developed and uniformly distributed. Among the agricultural industries of the state of Idaho that contribute to the economic welfare of the state is the dairy industry. Because of problems incurred in marketing the dairy products produced in this state and because this marketing has become more and more difficult in the presently available markets, it is necessary, in order to provide a profitable enterprise for the dairy industry of the state and to promote employment labor and to assist the dairymen of the state and those in the various industries dependent upon the dairymen, that additional markets be found and developed. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health and welfare of the citizens of our state by providing means for the protection, promotion, study, research, analysis and development of markets concerning the production and marketing of Idaho dairy products.\n\n[25-3101, added 1969, ch. 140, sec. 1, p. 435; am. 2013, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 408.]",
