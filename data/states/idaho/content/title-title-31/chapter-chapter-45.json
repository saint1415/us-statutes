All revenue bonds so issued shall be payable solely out of the revenues and receipts derived by the county from the pollution control facilities provided with the proceeds thereof as may be designated in the proceedings of the board under which the revenue bonds shall be authorized to be issued, provided that such revenue bonds shall not be secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the state of Idaho or of any political subdivision thereof, and such limitation shall be plainly printed on the face of each such revenue bond. Such revenue bonds may be executed and delivered by the county at any time and from time to time in such amounts, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in fully registered form or in bearer form registrable either as to principal or interest or both, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such time or times and at such place or places whether within or without the state of Idaho and evidenced in such manner, may bear interest at such rate or rates per annum without regard to any interest rate limitation appearing in any other law, may be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of such officers of the county, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board under which the revenue bonds shall be authorized to be issued. If deemed advisable by the board there may be retained in the proceedings under which any such revenue bonds are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on any county the right or option to redeem any such revenue bonds except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder may be sold at public or private sale for such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the board, and the county may pay, but solely and only from the proceeds of any such revenue bonds, all expenses, premiums and commissions which the board may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by any county of one (1) or more series of revenue bonds for one (1) or more purposes under this act shall not preclude it from issuing other revenue bonds in connection with the same pollution control facility or any other pollution control facility or for any other purpose hereunder, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issue of revenue bonds. Any revenue bonds issued hereunder at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the issuance of refunding bonds in such amount as the board may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums, commissions, service fees and other expenses necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same pollution control facility or separate pollution control facilities or for any other purpose hereunder, and regardless of whether or not the revenue bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable on the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise. All such revenue bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto, if any, are hereby made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments.\n\nThe resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds hereunder and the execution of an indenture as security therefor shall be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Any such indenture, or other instrument authorized in such resolution to be executed, may be incorporated as an exhibit to such resolution but need not be published as part of the resolution. For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such publication any person in interest may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to contest the regularity, formality or legality of the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds, or the legality of such resolution and its provisions or of the revenue bonds to be issued pursuant thereto and the provisions securing the revenue bonds. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period no one shall have any right of action to contest the validity of the revenue bonds or of such proceedings or of such resolution or the validity of the pledges and covenants made in such proceedings and resolution and the revenue bonds and the provisions for their payment shall be conclusively presumed to be legal and no court shall thereafter have authority to inquire into such matters.\n\n[31-4505, added 1975, ch. 52, sec. 5, p. 105.]",

Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of the revenue bonds issued hereunder shall continue effective until the principal of, and interest and premiums, if any, on the revenue bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made.
