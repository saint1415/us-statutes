At least seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the owners or contract purchasers of the land sought to be annexed shall petition the fire protection board and request annexation of the territory particularly described in said petition. Upon receipt of any such petition the fire protection board shall hold a hearing not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days thereafter, or upon the written consent of the petitioner within one hundred eighty (180) days, and said board shall cause notice of such hearing, designating the time and place, to be published in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper of general circulation within the district. Any person supporting or objecting to such petition shall be heard at such hearing, if in attendance, and at the close of such hearing said board shall approve or reject said petition. If the board approves said petition it shall make an order to that effect and certify a copy of said order containing an accurate legal description of the annexed territory to the board of county commissioners of the county where said fire district is situated. Said board of county commissioners shall thereupon enter an order of annexation and cause the same to be recorded so as to include the annexed property on the tax rolls as in this chapter provided.\n\nIn the event that more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the owners or contract purchasers of the land sought to be annexed do not join in said petition, and the board determines by resolution entered on the minutes of the board, that the annexation would be in the best interests of the district and that an election on the issue should be held, additional territory may nevertheless be annexed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified electors of such additional territory voting on the question at an election held therefor, which vote may be taken at an election held as provided in section 31-1405, Idaho Code. The same procedure shall be adopted as provided in sections 31-1402 through 31-1406, Idaho Code.\n\nIf owners or contract purchasers of territory located within an existing fire protection district seek to petition to be annexed into another fire protection district, they must demonstrate that they are likely to receive an improved response to requests for services from the other fire protection district and obtain written approval of the board of the fire protection district within which the territory is already located. The written approval must be attached to their petition to annex. The procedure for the annexation petition shall be the same as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n[31-1411, added 1943, ch. 161, sec. 11, p. 324; am. 1959, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 314; am. 1984, ch. 202, sec. 2, p. 493; am. 1994, ch. 360, sec. 2, p. 1128; am. 1995, ch. 84, sec. 1, p. 248; am. 1995, ch. 118, sec. 29, p. 454; am. 1996, ch. 360, sec. 3, p. 1213; am. 2006, ch. 318, sec. 8, p. 995.]",

After the organization of a fire protection district, additional territory, contiguous or noncontiguous thereto and located wholly within an adjoining county, may be added to the district and become a part thereof as hereinafter provided in this section. Noncontiguous territory annexed to an existing fire protection district shall consist of not less than forty (40) contiguous acres. The proceedings for annexation shall be the same as the proceedings for the creation and organization of a fire protection district with the following exceptions and modifications:\n\n(1) Such proceeding may be initiated by:\n\n(a) Two (2) or more of the holders of title or evidence of title to lands aggregating not less than one hundred (100) acres; or\n\n(b) One hundred percent (100%) of the holders of title or evidence of title to lands aggregating not less than one hundred (100) acres.\n\n(2) A petition, such as is required by section 31-1403, Idaho Code, shall be filed with the fire protection board of the fire protection district into which petitioners seek to be annexed. The petition shall accurately describe the boundaries of the territory and name and describe the fire protection district to which annexation is sought. The petition shall be accompanied by a map showing and distinguishing the boundaries of the original district and the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed, and showing the location of the intervening county line. An election is not required pursuant to subsection (5) of this section when the petition includes a certification as to the following: (a) that one hundred percent (100%) of the holders of title or evidence of title of the property proposed to be annexed have joined in the initial petition requesting annexation; and (b) that there is no electorate present in the property proposed to be annexed. The fire protection board shall follow the notice and public hearing requirements contained in section 31-1411, Idaho Code, and if it approves of the annexation proposal, it will issue a written resolution consenting to the proposed annexation. If the fire protection board issues such a resolution, the petitioners shall proceed in accordance with the steps outlined in this section.\n\n(3) A petition, such as is required by section 31-1403, Idaho Code, shall be filed with the board of county commissioners of the county in which is situated the territory proposed to be annexed but shall accurately describe the boundaries of the territory, and name and describe the fire protection district to which annexation is sought, shall be accompanied by a map showing and distinguishing the boundaries of the original district and the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed, and showing the location of the intervening county line.

The order entered by the local board of county commissioners on the petition shall, if the petition be granted, fix the boundaries of the annexed territory and direct that a map of it be prepared under the direction of the clerk of the board, and certified copies of the order and map shall be transmitted to the clerk of the board of county commissioners of the county in which the original fire protection district is situated.\n\n(5) An election shall be conducted by the county clerk or elections office in the county where the land sought to be annexed is situated, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, in the territory proposed to be annexed for the purpose of voting upon the annexation and the notice shall accurately describe the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed, shall state the name of the district to which annexation is sought, and that a map showing the boundaries of the district and of the territory proposed to be annexed is on file in the office of the clerk of the local board of county commissioners. The notice shall prescribe the form of ballot to be cast, which shall contain the words \"In favor of annexation to …. Fire Protection District\" and \"Against annexation to …. Fire Protection District,\" and shall direct that the voter indicate his choice thereon by a cross (X). An election pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall accomplish no purpose and, therefore, shall not be required if the following conditions are certified in the petition(s) submitted in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section: (a) that one hundred percent (100%) of the holders of title or evidence of title of the property proposed to be annexed have joined in the initial petition requesting annexation; and (b) that there is no electorate present in the property sought to be annexed.\n\n(6) The territory proposed to be annexed shall constitute one (1) election precinct and there shall be added to the usual elector’s oath, in case of challenge, the following words: \"And I am a resident within the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed to …. Fire Protection District.\" The returns of the election shall be canvassed by the board of the county commissioners of the county in which the territory proposed to be annexed is situated, and if it shall appear from the canvass that more than one-half (1/2) of the voters are in favor of the annexation, the board shall, by order entered on its minutes, declare the territory a part of the fire protection district to which annexation is sought, and a certified copy of the order shall be transmitted to the fire protection board of the original district, and also to the board of the county commissioners of the county in which the original district is situated. A certified copy of the order shall also be filed in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the territory proposed to be annexed is situated. At the first meeting of the board of fire protection commissioners following the annexation of property from another county, the board shall resubdivide the expanded fire protection district into three (3) subdivisions, as nearly equal in population and area as practicable. Not more than one (1) fire protection district commissioner shall reside in each subdistrict. If, because of resubdistricting, two (2) or more commissioners reside in the same subdistrict, they shall draw lots to determine who shall remain in office. The remaining commissioners on the board shall appoint, as necessary, persons to fill vacancies created as a result of annexation pursuant to the provisions of section 31-1409, Idaho Code. An appointee shall serve the remainder of the term of office he or she is appointed to fill. Certified copies of appointments of secretary and treasurer of the district shall be filed with the clerk of the board of county commissioners and with the tax collector of each county in which any portion of the district is situated and all taxes levied by the district shall be certified to, and extended, collected and remitted by, the proper officers of the county in which is situated the property subject to the levy.\n\n[31-1412, added 1943, ch. 161, sec. 12, p. 324; am. 1975, ch. 219, sec. 1, p. 610; am. 1980, ch. 350, sec. 6, p. 891; am. 1984, ch. 117, sec. 1, p. 262; am. 1984, ch. 202, sec. 3, p. 494; am. 1994, ch. 360, sec. 3, p. 1129; am. 1995, ch. 118, sec. 30, p. 455; am. 2006, ch. 318, sec. 11, p. 998; am. 2010, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 363.]",

Said notice shall give the boundaries of the fire protection district and shall state that a petition has been filed to dissolve the same, and that on the date fixed for the hearing, any taxpayer within the district, may appear at the hearing and testify and/or present exhibits upon any issue pertaining to the proposed dissolution of the fire district, or may object to or support the proposed dissolution.\n\nAfter hearing and considering any and all testimony and other evidence either made in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the fire district, if the board of county commissioners makes a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the fire district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the fire district, the county commissioners shall make an order granting the petition, with or without modification. Provided however, the board of county commissioners, after hearing and considering all testimony and other evidence either in favor of or in opposition to the dissolution of the fire district, cannot make a sufficient factual finding that the majority of the residents of the fire district will receive no benefit by continuing the existence of the fire district, the county commissioners shall make an order denying the petition. After the county commissioners have entered their order approving or denying such petition, the clerk of the board of county commissioners shall cause to be published, a notice of election to be held in such proposed fire protection district, for the purpose of determining whether or not the same shall be dissolved. Such notice shall plainly and clearly designate the boundaries of the fire protection district, its name, and further, that the election is to be held to decide the question of whether the fire protection district shall be maintained or dissolved. Such notice shall be published once in each week for three (3) successive publications prior to such election, in a newspaper published within the county aforesaid.\n\nSuch notice shall require the electors to cast ballots which shall contain the words \"fire protection district dissolved …. yes\" or: \"fire protection district dissolved …. no\" or words equivalent thereto. No person shall be entitled to vote at any election held under the provisions of this chapter, unless he shall possess all the qualifications required of electors under the general laws of the state and be a resident of the district.\n\nThe election qualifications of electors and canvass of the ballots shall be made in the same manner as provided for in sections 31-1406 and 31-1407, Idaho Code.\n\nIf a majority of the electors voting at such election shall vote to dissolve the fire protection district, the board of county commissioners shall, after certifying the results of such election, enter an order upon the minutes of its official proceedings dissolving said fire protection district, and such district shall thereupon be dissolved.\n\nProvided, however, that whenever a petition requesting dissolution of a fire protection district is signed by the holders of title, or evidence of title, to all of the real property included within the fire protection district and is presented to the board of county commissioners of the county in which the fire protection district is situated, accompanied by a map clearly designating the boundaries of the district, the board of county commissioners shall set a time for hearing of such petition, which time shall not be less than four (4) nor more than six (6) weeks from the date of the presenting and filing of said petition. A notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published by said board once a week for three (3) successive weeks previous to such hearing, in a newspaper published within the county in which the fire protection district is situated. Said notice shall give the boundaries of the fire protection district and shall state that a petition has been filed to dissolve the same, and that on the date fixed for the hearing, any resident, taxpayer, or creditor of such fire protection district may appear and offer any objection to the dissolving of the fire protection district. If at such hearing, no protests are made to the granting of the petition, the board of county commissioners shall enter an order upon the minutes of its official proceedings dissolving such fire protection district, and such district shall thereupon be dissolved. If, however, any protests from residents, taxpayers, or creditors of the district are entered at such hearing, the board of county commissioners shall, within thirty (30) days of said hearing, determine whether or not such fire protection district shall be dissolved and shall cause an order to that effect to be entered upon the minutes of its official proceedings. If the board determines that the fire protection district shall be dissolved, such dissolution shall be effective as of the date of the entry of such order upon the minutes.\n\nThe property of such district shall remain the property of the county in which such district is located and any money remaining in the fund of such district shall be expended in the maintenance and repair of the highways of such district whether such highways at the time of the dissolution, are in the incorporated territory or in unincorporated territory.\n\nIf the district is situated in two (2) or more counties, each board of county commissioners shall coordinate the hearing date and the publications of notice so that only one (1) hearing need be held. Unless otherwise agreed to by each board of county commissioners involved, the hearing shall be held at the administrative offices of the district, and the boards of county commissioners are hereby specifically authorized to act in a joint manner for such purposes. If an election is called, the boards of county commissioners shall provide that the election be held on the same day in each county, and the boards of county commissioners shall coordinate the canvass of the votes cast and make one (1) joint announcement. If a majority of votes in any county are against the dissolution of the district, such rejection shall void the dissolution of the district in all counties.\n\n[(31-1434) 31-1435, added 1943, ch. 161, sec. 35, p. 324; am. 1945, ch. 115, sec. 1, p. 177; am. 1949, ch. 154, sec. 1, p. 330; am. 1974, ch. 52, sec. 1, p. 1112; am. 1980, ch. 350, sec. 8, p. 894; am. 1986, ch. 137, sec. 9, p. 371; am. and redesig. 2006, ch. 318, sec. 35, p. 1011.]",
