The legislature recognizes that providing consolidated emergency communications systems and interoperable public safety communications and data systems is vital in enhancing the public health, safety, and welfare of the people in the state of Idaho. The legislature further finds that there is an obvious need for providing a means to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of interoperable and consolidated emergency communications systems.\n\n(1) The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that:\n\n(a) Since the original enactment of the emergency communications act in 1988, many of Idaho’s communities have found that they are lacking in the resources to fully fund emergency communications systems at the local level;\n\n(b) Changes in technology and the rapid growth of communications media have demonstrated that financing such systems solely by a line charge on subscribers to wireline services does not reflect utilization of emergency communications systems by subscribers to wireless and other forms of communications systems;\n\n(c) There is a need to enhance funding for the initiation and enhancement of consolidated emergency communications systems throughout the state;\n\n(d) Utilization of cellular telephones and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) communications to access emergency communications systems has substantially increased citizen access to emergency services while at the same time increasing demands upon the emergency response system;\n\n(e) In order to protect and promote the public health and safety, and to keep pace with advances in telecommunications technology and the various choices of telecommunications technology available to the public, there is a need to plan and develop a statewide coordinated policy and program to ensure that enhanced 911 services, next generation 911 services, and future and emerging public safety technologies are available to all citizens of the state and people in all areas of the state.\n\n(2) Therefore, it is hereby declared that the intent and purpose of the provisions of this act are to:\n\n(a) Provide authority to counties and 911 service areas to impose an emergency communications fee on the use of telephone lines, wireless, VoIP or other communications services that connect an individual or entity dialing or accessing 911 to an established public safety answering point;\n\n(b) Provide that the emergency communications fee in section 31-4803, Idaho Code, shall be exclusively utilized by the counties or 911 service areas electing to impose it to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of consolidated emergency systems as well as enhanced consolidated emergency systems or next generation consolidated emergency systems;\n\n(c) Provide for the agreed-to reimbursement to telecommunications providers for their implementation of enhanced consolidated emergency communications systems by counties or 911 service areas that have implemented enhanced consolidated emergency communications systems;\n\n(d) Create the Idaho public safety communications commission that will have the duty to provide the governance structure through which public safety communications stakeholders can collaborate to advance consistency and common objectives, to provide integrated facilitation and coordination for cross-jurisdictional consensus building, to assist in the standardization of agreements for sharing resources among jurisdictions with emergency response communications infrastructure, to suggest best practices, performance measures and performance evaluation in the integrated statewide strategic planning and implementation of interoperability among public safety communications professionals and entities that serve people in Idaho regardless of jurisdiction, to manage the Idaho public safety interoperable communications and data systems fund as established by section 31-4820, Idaho Code, and to pursue budget authorizations as set forth in this chapter.\n\n[31-4801, added 1988, ch. 348, sec. 1, p. 1027; am. 1990, ch. 200, sec. 1, p. 449; am. 2003, ch. 290, sec. 1, p. 785; am. 2003, ch. 311, sec. 1, p. 853; am. 2004, ch. 325, sec. 1, p. 973; am. 2007, ch. 340, sec. 1, p. 995; am. 2016, ch. 127, sec. 1, p. 364.]",

      "text": "31-4803. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH AND FOR VOTERS TO APPROVE FUNDING FOR A CONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. (1) The board of commissioners of any county may establish a consolidated emergency communications system by virtue of authority granted by this chapter or by chapter 23, title 67, Idaho Code. The service area may be regional, multicounty, countywide, or any part or parts of the county, and may include or exclude a city or cities. If the board of county commissioners has adopted a resolution stating that the county is unable to establish a countywide consolidated emergency communications system, or if the voters reject a countywide consolidated 911 system, then a 911 service area may be established by action of any city or cities within the county. The 911 service area shall be described in the ordinance of creation. The ordinance shall further provide for an election on the question as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The ordinance of creation shall define the governing board, designate the administrator, and the agency to service the 911 calls. The costs of the election ordered by the county shall be a proper charge against the county current expense fund. The costs of the election for a 911 service area shall be a proper charge against the city or cities initiating the election.\n\n(2) The voters of any county or 911 service area may authorize funding to support implementation of a consolidated emergency communications system pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The authorization to provide such funding must be made by the registered voters of the county or of the 911 service area at either a primary or general election. A notice for any election shall be published for twenty (20) days as required by section 60-109, Idaho Code. A sixty percent (60%) majority of the votes cast in favor of the question shall be necessary to authorize the emergency communications fee.\n\n(3) If a 911 system is to be financed in whole or in part by an emergency communications fee, the governing board shall submit the question to the electors of the county or 911 service area in substantially the following form:\n\n\"Shall the governing board of ………… be authorized to institute an emergency communications fee in an amount no greater than one dollar ($l.00) per month to be used to fund an emergency telephone system, commonly known as 911 service?\".\n\n(4) No emergency communications fee for a consolidated emergency communications system shall be charged without voter approval as provided in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(5) Any net savings in operating expenditures realized by any taxing district utilizing a consolidated emergency communications system shall be used by that taxing district for a reduction in the property tax charges of that taxing district.\n\n(6) If the voters of any county or 911 service area have previously approved funding of a consolidated emergency communications system in the manner provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, no further vote is necessary to authorize the emergency communications fee set forth in this act.\n\n(7) Effective October 1, 2004, and every year thereafter, the emergency communications fee provided for in this act shall be reviewed and modified as required by this subsection by the board of commissioners of a countywide system or by the governing board of a 911 service area as follows:\n\n(a) The level of the emergency communications fee shall be reviewed and, as appropriate and necessary, readjusted by action of the board of commissioners or the governing board on an annual basis. The board of commissioners or governing board shall set the level of the fee based upon the revenue requirements necessary to implement an annual budget prepared under the direction of the board of commissioners or governing board for the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of a consolidated emergency communications system, including both basic and, if applicable, enhanced consolidated emergency systems.\n\n(b) The revenues from emergency communications fees shall be exclusively expended pursuant to the budget established in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Use of such revenues for any other purpose is expressly prohibited.\n\n(c) The process of reviewing and setting the level of emergency communications fees shall be governed by the meeting and public notice provisions of section 31-710(4), Idaho Code. For the purposes of this section, the setting of a fee shall be deemed to be the promulgation of a rule such that public participation provisions of section 67-5222, Idaho Code, shall apply to the meetings of the board of commissioners or of a governing board pursuant to this section.\n\n[31-4803, added 1988, ch. 348, sec. 1, p. 1028; am. 1989, ch. 196, sec. 1, p. 492; am. 1990, ch. 200, sec. 3, p. 450; am. 1994, ch. 86, sec. 2, p. 203; am. 2003, ch. 290, sec. 3, p. 787.]",

(1) The emergency communications fee provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be a uniform amount not to exceed one dollar ($1.00) per month per access or interconnected VoIP service line, and such fee shall be used exclusively to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of a consolidated emergency communications system and provide for the reimbursement of telecommunications providers for implementing enhanced consolidated emergency systems as provided for in section 31-4804A, Idaho Code. All emergency communications fees collected and expended pursuant to this section shall be audited by an independent, third-party auditor ordinarily retained by the governing board for auditing purposes. The purpose of the audit as related to emergency communications systems is to verify the accuracy and completeness of fees collected and costs expended.\n\n(2) The fee shall be imposed upon and collected from purchasers of access lines or interconnected VoIP service lines with a service address or place of primary use within the county or 911 service area on a monthly basis by all telecommunications providers of such services. The fee may be listed as a separate item on customers’ monthly bills.\n\n(3) The telecommunications providers shall remit such fee to the county treasurer’s office or the administrator for the 911 service area based upon the 911 service area from which the fees were collected. In the event the telecommunications provider remits such fees based upon the emergency communications fee billed to the customer, a deduction shall be allowed for uncollected amounts when such amounts are treated as bad debt for financial reporting purposes.\n\n(4) From every remittance to the governing body made on or before the date when the same becomes due, the telecommunications provider required to remit the same shall be entitled to deduct and retain one percent (1%) of the collected amount as the cost of administration for collecting the charge. Telecommunications providers will be allowed to list the surcharge as a separate item on the telephone subscriber’s bill and shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any charge, nor be held liable for such uncollected amounts.\n\n(5) Use of fees. The emergency communications fee provided hereunder shall be used only to pay for the lease, purchase or maintenance of emergency communications equipment for basic and enhanced consolidated emergency systems, and next generation consolidated emergency systems (NG911), including necessary computer hardware, software, database provisioning, training, salaries directly related to such systems, costs of establishing such systems, management, maintenance and operation of hardware and software applications and agreed-to reimbursement costs of telecommunications providers related to the operation of such systems. Use of the emergency communications fee should, if possible, coincide with the strategic goals as identified by the Idaho public safety communications commission in its annual report to the legislature. However, the county or 911 service area governing board has final authority on lawful expenditures. All other expenditures necessary to operate such systems and other normal and necessary safety or law enforcement functions including, but not limited to, those expenditures related to overhead, staffing, dispatching, administrative and other day-to-day operational expenditures, shall continue to be paid through the general funding of the respective governing boards; provided however, that any governing body using the emergency communications fee to pay the salaries of dispatchers as of March 1, 2006, may continue to do so until the beginning of such governing body’s 2007 fiscal year.\n\n[31-4804, added 1988, ch. 348, sec. 1, p. 1028; am. 1990, ch. 200, sec. 4, p. 451; am. 2003, ch. 290, sec. 4, p. 788; am. 2003, ch. 311, sec. 2, p. 854; am. 2006, ch. 238, sec. 1, p. 722; am. 2007, ch. 340, sec. 3, p. 997; am. 2016, ch. 127, sec. 3, p. 367.]",

Provided however, if a minimal amount of prepaid wireless telecommunications service is sold with a prepaid wireless device for a single, nonitemized price, then the seller may elect not to apply the percentage specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection to such transaction. For purposes of this subparagraph, an amount of service denominated as ten (10) minutes or less, or five dollars ($5.00) or less, is minimal.\n\n(3) (a) Prepaid wireless E911 fees collected by sellers shall be remitted to the tax commission at the times and in the manner provided by chapter 36, title 63, Idaho Code, with respect to the sales tax.
