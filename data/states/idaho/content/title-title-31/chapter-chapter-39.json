At the first election following organization of an ambulance service district, the commissioner from ambulance service subdistrict 1 shall be elected to a term of two (2) years and the commissioners from subdistricts 2 and 3 shall be elected to a term of four (4) years; thereafter, the term of office of all commissioners shall be four (4) years. For commissioners whose term in office expires in any even-numbered year, such commissioners shall remain in office until the next election in an odd-numbered year. Such elections and all other elections held under this chapter shall be held in conformity with the general laws of the state including chapter 14, title 34, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Any ambulance service commissioner vacancy occurring, other than by the expiration of the term of office, shall be filled by the board of ambulance service commissioners. If a duly elected or appointed ambulance service commissioner resigns, withdraws, becomes disqualified, refuses or, without first providing signed written notice of a temporary vacancy, becomes otherwise unable to perform the duties of office for longer than ninety (90) days, the board, on satisfactory proof of the vacancy, shall declare the office vacant.

The vacancies shall be filled by the board or boards of county commissioners within sixty (60) days of receiving a written petition.

The petition, together with all maps and other papers filed therewith, shall, at proper hours, be open to public inspection in the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners between the date of said filing and the date of the election on the question of districts as provided in this section.

After the county commissioners have entered their order approving or denying such petition, the clerk of the board of county commissioners shall cause to be published a notice of election to be held in such proposed ambulance service district for the purpose of determining whether or not the same shall be dissolved. Such notice shall plainly and clearly designate the boundaries of the ambulance service district, its name, and that the election is to be held to decide the question of whether the ambulance service district shall be maintained or dissolved. Such notice shall be published once each week in a newspaper published within the county for three (3) successive publications prior to such election.\n\n(3) Such notice shall require the electors to cast ballots that shall contain the words \"… ambulance service district dissolved, yes\" or \"… ambulance service district dissolved, no\" or words equivalent thereto.

Unless otherwise agreed to by each board of county commissioners involved, the hearing shall be held at the administrative offices of the district, and the boards of county commissioners are hereby specifically authorized to act in a joint manner for such purposes. If an election is called, the boards of county commissioners shall provide that the election be held on the same day in each county, and the boards of county commissioners shall coordinate the canvass of the votes cast and make one (1) joint announcement.
