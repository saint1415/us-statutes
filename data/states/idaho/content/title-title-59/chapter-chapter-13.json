Acceptance by the board of an employer’s certification shall in no way limit the board’s right to review and reclassify the position for retirement purposes based on an audit or other relevant information presented to the board. The board may carry out such acts as are necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(5) A member classified as a police officer for retirement purposes whose position is reclassified to that of a general member for retirement purposes as a result of a determination that the position does not meet the requirements of this chapter for police officer member status for retirement purposes shall become a general member. Excess employer and employee contributions shall be refunded to the employer by offsetting future contributions and the member’s record shall be corrected.

It shall have the powers and privileges of a corporation, including the right to sue and be sued in its own name as such board. Members of the retirement board, retirement system staff and retirement system mortgage and investment committee members shall, jointly and individually, be provided a defense and indemnified against all claims, demands, judgments, costs, charges and expenses, including court costs and attorney’s fees, and against all liability losses and damages of any nature whatsoever that arise out of and in the course and scope of their official duties and functions, but only if the defense and indemnity for such person’s wrongful act or omission are not provided by chapter 9, title 6, Idaho Code, and the wrongful act or omission of the person was not intentional, willful or wanton misconduct, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of law. The board may, as a fiduciary of the trust, determine to provide a defense and indemnity hereunder. The board may, as a fiduciary of the trust, determine to refuse a defense or disavow and refuse to pay any judgment against a board member, retirement system staff, or retirement system mortgage and investment committee member if it is determined that such person was not within the course and scope of his official duties and functions or his conduct was intentional misconduct, willful, wanton, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of the law. Any defense and indemnity provided under this section shall be an expense of the trust, and the board is authorized but not required to purchase insurance to protect against such risks notwithstanding any other provision of law. No contribution or indemnification, or reimbursement for legal fees and expenses related to such defense or indemnification, shall be sought from any person defended or indemnified under this section unless the court in which the underlying claim was brought finds that the act or omission of the person was outside the course and scope of his official duties and functions or was intentional, willful or wanton misconduct, fraudulent, or a knowing violation of law. Any action by the trust against a board member, retirement system staff, or mortgage and investment committee member, and any action by a person against the trust for contribution, indemnification or necessary legal fees and expenses, shall be tried to the court in the same civil lawsuit brought on the claim against the retirement board member, retirement system staff, or retirement system mortgage and investment committee member. The venue of all actions in which the board is a party shall be Ada county, Idaho.\n\n(2) The board shall appoint an executive director to serve at its discretion. The executive director shall be the secretary to the board, bonded as is required by the board, and shall perform such duties as assigned by the board. The executive director shall be authorized to designate a staff member as acting director or secretary in the director’s absence.\n\n(3) The board shall authorize the creation of whatever staff it deems necessary for sound and economical administration of the system. The executive director shall hire the persons for the staff who shall hold their respective positions subject to the rules of a merit system for state employees. The salaries and compensation of all persons employed for purposes of administering the system shall be fixed by the board and as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(4) The board shall obtain all actuarial, audit, legal and medical services it deems appropriate for the system. It shall cause a competent actuary who is a member of the academy of actuaries and who is familiar with public systems of pensions to be retained on a consulting basis. The actuary shall be the technical advisor of the board on matters regarding the operation of the system. During the first year of operation of the system and at least once every four (4) years thereafter, the actuary shall make a general investigation of the suitability of the actuarial tables used by the system. The board shall adopt the actuarial tables and assumptions in use by the system and may change the same in its sole discretion at any time. The actuary shall make an annual valuation of the liabilities and reserves of the system and an annual determination of the amount of contributions required from the employers under this chapter and certify the results thereof to the board. The actuary shall also perform such other duties as may be assigned by the board. An independent financial audit shall be conducted annually or as frequently as otherwise determined by the board.\n\n(5) The board shall establish the system’s office or offices to be used for the meetings of the board and for the general purposes of the administrative personnel. The board shall provide for the installation of a complete and adequate system of accounts and records for administering this chapter. All books and records shall be kept in the system’s offices.\n\n(6) If the board determines that it has previously overpaid or underpaid benefits provided under this chapter or chapter 14, title 72, Idaho Code, it shall correct the prior error. In the event of prior underpayment, the board shall forthwith pay the amount of the underpayment together with regular interest thereon. In the event of prior overpayment, the board may offset future benefit payments by the amount of the prior overpayment together with regular interest thereon. Any such decision to offset future benefit payments shall be administratively and judicially reviewable as provided in section 59-1314, Idaho Code. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the rights of a member or the board to pursue any other remedy provided by law.\n\n(7)(a) For the collection of an overpayment, the board shall have the power to issue subpoenas to financial institutions to compel the production of evidence to determine if persons other than a deceased retiree or a deceased beneficiary have access to an account.\n\n(b) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section may be enforced by the district courts of Ada county. The court shall have jurisdiction to hear the parties, determine the reasonableness of the subpoena, and to set aside, modify, or enforce the subpoena by its order in accordance with the evidence.

(1) The state shall sponsor and the board shall administer one (1) or more supplemental benefit plans to be used for allocation of extraordinary gains as provided in section 59-1309, Idaho Code, and for voluntary contributions of active members. The supplemental plans may be established under the qualified requirements of section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and with the qualified cash or deferred arrangements under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code or any other tax-deferred plan permitted by law, as determined by the retirement board. The board is authorized to secure such qualified staff and consultants as it determines necessary to establish and administer such plans. Employee and employer contributions shall be permitted according to the provisions of these plans as established by the board. For purposes of this section, \"employee\" shall mean a participant as defined in the supplemental benefit plan documents or board rules.\n\n(2) The board is authorized, but not required, to establish separate trust funds to hold the assets of the supplemental benefit plans created under this section. The investment options available under supplemental benefit plans shall be determined by the board and may include but are not limited to investment in all or part of the public employee retirement fund and use of private vendor options.\n\n(3) Supplemental benefit plans shall be available to all active members and shall be in addition to any other retirement or tax-deferred compensation system established by the employer. The board may provide educational opportunities related to supplemental benefit plans and retirement savings, as determined by the board.\n\n(4) Accounts shall be established in supplemental benefit plans for all active members eligible for an extraordinary gains transfer under section 59-1309, Idaho Code. After the initial transfer of extraordinary gains, any active member may make additional voluntary contributions to his/her account, subject to applicable limitations, by authorizing his/her employer to contribute an amount by payroll deduction to the supplemental benefit plan in lieu of receiving such amount as salary. The amount of such contributions shall be subject to any limitations established by the board or state or federal law. The employer shall provide coordination of contributions between multiple plans to assure that contribution limits are not exceeded. Should aggregate contributions to multiple plans exceed applicable limits, excess contributions shall be deemed to apply exclusively to plans not created by this chapter. In the event a preexisting plan is used as a supplemental plan, voluntary contributions may continue to be made to that plan despite the absence of extraordinary gains transfers.\n\n(5) For purposes of this section, the employer is authorized to make such deductions from salary for any employee who has authorized such deductions in writing.

All such funds are hereby perpetually appropriated to the board, shall not be included in the department’s budget, and may be invested or used to pay for investment and administrative expenses of the supplemental benefit plans. Inactive members may be required to transfer supplemental benefit plan account balances as determined by the board.\n\n(8) The board may establish rules to implement and administer supplemental benefit plans. Costs of administration shall be appropriated by the legislature and may be paid from the interest earnings of the funds accrued as a result of the deposits or as an assessment against each account, to be decided by the board. Investment-related expenses are exempt from appropriation.\n\n(9)(a) Qualified pre-tax contributions and investment earnings under the supplemental benefit plans shall be in compliance with the requirements of sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code or any other tax-deferred plan permitted by law.\n\n(b) Qualified after-tax contributions shall be in compliance with the requirements of section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(c) Distributions of funds held in supplemental benefit plan accounts are subject to federal law limitations. The board may provide for retirement disbursement options other than lump sum payments.\n\n(10) All additional contributions made by the employee under this section shall continue to be included as regular compensation for the purpose of computing the employer and employee retirement contributions and pension benefits earned by an employee under this chapter, but such sum shall not be included in the computation of any income taxes withheld on behalf of any employee. However, funds accrued in a supplemental benefit plan account shall not be considered in determining any other benefits under this chapter.\n\n(11) The provisions of sections 59-1316 and 59-1317(1), (2) and (5), Idaho Code, shall also apply to the supplemental benefit plans created under this section.

In determining whether extraordinary gains should be allocated, the board shall exercise its fiduciary discretion.\n\n(2) Extraordinary gains are defined as the excess, if any, at the close of the fiscal year of plan assets over the plan’s accrued actuarially determined liabilities plus a sum necessary to absorb a one (1) standard deviation market event without increasing contribution rates, as determined by the board.\n\n(3) If the board determines that extraordinary gains should be allocated, the gains shall be allocated to retirees, to active members, and to employers in such proportion as determined by the board. The board shall determine no later than the first day of December following the close of the fiscal year the amount of extraordinary gains to be allocated, if any.\n\n(4) Retirees shall receive their allocation in the form of a one-time payment made in addition to their regular monthly benefit payments. For purposes of this section, \"retirees\" include retired members, members receiving a disability retirement allowance, contingent annuitants, and surviving spouses who elected the annuity option under section 59-1361(5), Idaho Code. To participate in the retiree allocation, a retiree must be receiving a regular monthly allowance at the close of the fiscal year and on the date of distribution. The retiree allocation shall be distributed proportionally based on the final monthly retirement allowance of the fiscal year divided by the total of all monthly retirement allowances paid for the same month. The date of distribution shall be no later than the first day of February following the close of the fiscal year.\n\n(5) Active members shall receive their allocation as a transfer of funds to a supplemental retirement account established by the board. Funds transferred to or held in supplemental retirement accounts shall be accounted for separately and shall not be considered in determining any other benefits under this chapter. To participate in the active member allocation, the member must have been an active member on the last day of the fiscal year and have accrued at least twelve (12) months of service on that date. Any member who has withdrawn contributions from the fund prior to the date of transfer is not eligible to receive a transfer under this section. The active member allocation shall be distributed proportionally based on accumulated contributions at the close of the fiscal year divided by the total accumulated contributions of all active members at the close of the fiscal year, not to exceed the amount that would result by applying the limits imposed by rule or by section 415(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code to compensation earned during the fiscal year. The transfer of funds shall occur in the following calendar year but shall be subject to reduction and forfeiture, based on the application of limits imposed by rule or by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code for that year.\n\n(6) Employers shall receive their allocation as a credit against future contributions required by section 59-1325, Idaho Code. Credits are not available to any employer who has withdrawn from participation in the fund prior to the transfer date. The employer allocation shall be credited proportionally based on employer contribution liability accrued during the fiscal year as provided in section 59-1322, Idaho Code, divided by the total employer contribution liability for the fiscal year. The credits shall be established no later than the first day of February following the close of the fiscal year. The credits shall be applied thereafter in the same manner as provided in section 59-1325, Idaho Code, until exhausted. If, after twelve (12) months of remittances, an employer’s credits have not been exhausted, and the employer has not withdrawn from participation in the fund, the value of the remaining credits shall carry over to the next year, together with an interest payment equal to regular interest on the remaining credits.\n\n[59-1309, added 2000, ch. 208, sec. 2, p. 531.]",

(1) There is hereby established in the state treasury a special fund, the \"Public Employee Retirement Fund,\" which shall be separate and apart from all public moneys or funds of this state and shall be administered under the direction of the board exclusively for the purposes of this chapter. The state treasurer shall maintain within the fund a clearing account, a portfolio investment expense account and an administration account.\n\n(2) All contributions received from employers by the board on their account and on account of members shall be deposited with a funding agent designated by the board. All such funds are hereby perpetually appropriated to the board and shall not be included in the department’s administration account budget and shall be invested or used to pay for investment-related expenses.\n\n(3) As needed to pay current obligations, the board shall transfer funds from the funding agent to the state treasurer’s office for deposit into the administration account. All funds deposited in the administration account shall be available to the board for the payment of administrative expenses only to the extent so appropriated by the legislature.\n\n(4) As required by the board, the funding agent shall transfer funds to the state treasurer’s office for deposit into the portfolio investment expense account for payment of investment expenses.

All expenses of the portfolio investment expense account shall be reported on a quarterly basis to the legislature and to the division of financial management in the office of the governor.\n\n(5) As required by the board, the funding agent shall transfer funds to the state treasurer’s office for deposit into the clearing account. All benefits for members shall be payable directly from the clearing account or by the funding agent as they come due. If the amount of such benefits payable at any time exceeds the amount in the clearing account, the payment of all or part of such benefits may be postponed until the clearing account becomes adequate to meet all such payments, or the board may require a refund from the funding agent sufficient to meet all such payments.\n\n(6) Moneys representing member entitlements that remain unclaimed after reasonable attempts to effect payment shall remain in the retirement fund available for payment to the member or other established rightful payee.\n\n[(59-1311) 1963, ch. 349, Art. 9, sec. 2, p. 988; am. 1980, ch. 51, sec. 2, p. 106; am. 1985, ch. 168, sec. 5, p. 448; am. 1989, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 461; am. and redesig. 1990, ch. 231, sec. 9, p. 622; am. 1992, ch. 220, sec. 3, p. 662; am. 1996, ch. 79, sec. 3, p. 257; am. 2020, ch. 137, sec. 1, p. 424.]",

      "text": "59-1320. APPROVED DOMESTIC RETIREMENT ORDERS — APPLICATION AND EFFECT. (1) The executive director of the public employee retirement system or his designee upon receipt of a copy of a domestic retirement order, shall determine whether the order is an approved domestic retirement order and shall notify the member and the alternate payee of the determination within ninety (90) days. Orders shall be applied prospectively only from the first day of the month following the order being determined to be an approved domestic retirement order. The retirement system shall then pay benefits or establish a segregated account in accordance with the order. When established, the segregated account will consist of accumulated contributions identified in the approved domestic retirement order together with accrued interest on that amount from the effective date to the date of segregation.\n\n(2) If the order is determined not to be an approved domestic retirement order, or if no determination is issued within ninety (90) days, the member or the alternate payee named in the order may move the court which issued the order to amend the order so that it will be approved. The court that issued the order or which would otherwise have jurisdiction over the matter has jurisdiction to amend the order so that it will be qualified even though all other matters incident to the action or proceeding have been fully and finally adjudicated.\n\n(3) The executive director of the retirement system to which a domestic retirement order is submitted or his designee has exclusive authority to determine whether a domestic retirement order is an approved domestic retirement order. If it is determined that a domestic retirement order does not meet the requirements for an approved domestic retirement order, both the issuing court and the parties to the order shall be notified so action may be taken to amend the order.\n\n(4) Because an approved domestic retirement order cannot cause the retirement system to pay any benefit or any amount of benefit greater than would have been paid had the member’s account not been segregated, disputes related to benefits paid under an approved domestic retirement order shall be resolved between the parties to the order by the court issuing that order. The retirement system shall not be made a party to the action. Any cost, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the retirement system as a result of such actions shall be distributed by the court among the parties and included in any amended order issued.\n\n(5) Unless the approved domestic retirement order specifies differently, if the member has a right to a vested benefit as of the effective date of the order, then both the member and the alternate payee shall have a right to a vested benefit after the transfer of months of service even if the member or the alternate payee has less than sixty (60) months of membership service.\n\n(6) For benefits under chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, for members other than retired members, if the domestic retirement order awards to the alternate payee a portion of the member’s accumulated contributions the alternate payee shall be entitled to all the same benefits and rights an inactive member has under chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code. The alternate payee’s benefit calculation for a lifetime annuity shall use the member’s average monthly salary and base period as of the effective date of the order and the months of credited service transferred to the alternate payee’s segregated account. The benefit calculation shall use the alternate payee’s age with the appropriate reduction factors based on the alternate payee’s age at the time of payment of the lifetime annuity. For the purpose of the lifetime annuity, the bridging factor, as specified in section 59-1355, Idaho Code, shall be the bridging factor between the effective date of the order or the last day of contributions by the member prior to the effective date of the order, whichever is earliest, and the date of the first lifetime annuity payment to the alternate payee. The alternate payee shall have the right to select any of the optional retirement allowances provided in section 59-1351, Idaho Code. The alternate payee shall have the right to name a beneficiary.\n\n(7) For benefits defined under chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, for retired members, and for benefits under chapter 14, title 72, Idaho Code, the retirement system shall include in the alternate payee’s amount or percentage of the benefit, on a proportional basis, all future adjustments, including postretirement increases that are granted by the retirement system, and any death benefit.\n\n(8) For benefits under chapter 13, title 59, Idaho Code, for retired members, the form of payment previously elected by the member under section 59-1351, Idaho Code, cannot be changed by a domestic retirement order, except that a member’s benefit may be adjusted as provided in section 59-1351(2), Idaho Code, if an alternate payee waives all survivor benefits otherwise payable as a contingent annuitant as provided in section 59-1319(1)(e), Idaho Code.

      "text": "59-1326. PROCEDURE FOR COMPLETE OR PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL OF POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS FROM THE SYSTEM — CALCULATION OF WITHDRAWAL PENALTY — INDEMNIFICATION. (1) A political subdivision, through its governing body, may by resolution adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the governing body declare its intent to withdraw completely from the system and to submit the question of withdrawing from the system to the active members of the political subdivision. The political subdivision shall notify its employees and the retirement board, in writing, of its action and shall advise the active members of their right to vote for or against withdrawal, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. A political subdivision shall automatically be considered to have requested a complete withdrawal from the system on the date the political subdivision permanently ceases to employ active members. A withdrawing political subdivision shall be required to make withdrawal penalty payments as provided in this section.\n\n(2) All active members of the withdrawing political subdivision shall be allowed to vote by secret ballot for or against allowing the political subdivision to completely withdraw from the system. More than fifty percent (50%) of the withdrawing political subdivision’s active members must approve the complete withdrawal at least thirty (30) days before the effective withdrawal date. All active members of the withdrawing political subdivision who are on the political subdivision’s payroll thirty (30) days before the effective withdrawal date shall be allowed to vote. If more than fifty percent (50%) of the withdrawing political subdivision’s active members fail to vote for complete withdrawal, the political subdivision shall not be allowed to withdraw. Fifteen (15) days before the effective withdrawal date, the governing board of the withdrawing political subdivision shall certify to the retirement board the results of the voting by the active members.\n\n(3) Partial withdrawal occurs for a political subdivision when its average membership declines for two (2) consecutive fiscal years either by more than twenty-five (25) members or by twenty-five percent (25%) of the average membership. For purposes of this subsection, the effective date of partial withdrawal is the first day after the end of the two (2) consecutive fiscal year period. Average membership for a two (2) consecutive fiscal year period shall be calculated as one twenty-fourth(1/24) of the sum of the number of active members employed during each month of such period.\n\n(4) Complete withdrawal by a political subdivision shall be on the first day of the month following the date the political subdivision ceases to employ active members or the first day of the month following sixty (60) days from the date the board receives the political subdivision’s written request to withdraw. However, the complete withdrawal date shall not occur before the withdrawal penalty is determined, as provided in subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(5) After complete withdrawal, all employees of the withdrawing political subdivision shall be ineligible to accrue future benefits with the system due to employment with the withdrawing political subdivision. The withdrawing political subdivision shall be ineligible to request to be included in the system, as provided in section 59-1321, Idaho Code, for five (5) years after its complete withdrawal date.\n\n(6) All active or inactive members of the political subdivision shall be eligible for benefits accrued with the system up to the complete withdrawal date. However, no retirement allowance or separation benefit shall be paid until the member actually separates from service with the withdrawing political subdivision, and there is no guarantee of right to reemployment made by the withdrawing political subdivision. If the person returns to employment with the same withdrawing political subdivision within ninety (90) days, any separation benefit or retirement allowance paid to the person shall be repaid to the system.\n\n(7) On the date of complete withdrawal, the withdrawal penalty for an employer is (a) multiplied by the ratio of (b) to (c) as follows:\n\n(a) The excess of the actuarial present value of the vested accrued benefits of the system’s members over the fair value of its assets, both as of the date of the last actuarial valuation adopted by the board prior to the complete withdrawal date based on the assumption that thirty percent (30%) of all terminating employees will eventually return to employment covered by the system and that future cost-of-living allowances as provided in section 59-1355, Idaho Code, will be at a rate of two percent (2%) per year;\n\n(b) The total present value of accrued benefits of all active members of the withdrawing political subdivision as of the last actuarial valuation adopted by the board prior to the complete withdrawal date;\n\n(c) The total present value of accrued benefits of all active members of the system as of the last actuarial valuation adopted by the board prior to the complete withdrawal date.\n\nThe actuarial costs to determine the amount described in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be paid by the withdrawing political subdivision.\n\n(8) On the date of partial withdrawal, the withdrawal penalty for an employer is the same as if complete withdrawal had occurred, multiplied by one (1) minus the ratio of (a) to (b) as follows:\n\n(a) The average membership of the employer estimated by the board for the year commencing on such date;\n\n(b) The average membership of the employer during the second complete fiscal year prior to such date.\n\n(9) The withdrawing political subdivision shall enter into a contract with the system that establishes terms for the political subdivision’s payment of its withdrawal penalty. The contract shall use an interest rate equal to the interest rate used in the actuarial valuation adopted by the board prior to the withdrawal date, net of actuarially assumed investment expenses. The contract shall not extend the duration of the withdrawal penalty payments beyond ten (10) years or the end of the current amortization period, whichever is less. The contract shall be a financial obligation of the withdrawing political subdivision and any of its successors and assigns. \"Current amortization period\" means the period over which the amortization payment rate times the actuarial present value of the projected salaries is equivalent to the unfunded actuarial penalty, all determined by the current valuation last adopted by the board prior to the complete withdrawal date.\n\n(10) Upon the complete withdrawal of the political subdivision, the system shall have no further legal obligation to the political subdivision or its employees, and the system shall not be held accountable for the continued future accrual of any retirement benefit rights to which such employees may be entitled beyond the complete withdrawal date. Any litigation regarding the forfeiture of any benefits because of the political subdivision’s complete withdrawal from the system shall be the sole legal responsibility of the withdrawing political subdivision, and the withdrawing political subdivision shall indemnify and hold harmless the system, its board, its employees, and the state of Idaho from any claims, losses, costs, damages, expenses, and liabilities, including without limitation court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees asserted by any person or entity as a result of the political subdivision’s withdrawal from the system.\n\n[(59-1326) 59-1309A, added 1981, ch. 152, sec. 1, p. 263; am. 1984, ch. 132, sec. 2, p. 313; am. and redesig. 1990, ch. 231, sec. 22, p. 628; am. 1992, ch. 220, sec. 5, p. 664; am. 1996, ch. 251, sec. 1, p. 792; am. 2022, ch. 39, sec. 1, p. 101.]",

(1) The annual amount of accrued retirement allowance for each month of credited service for which a member was not classified as a police member or firefighter shall equal one and two-thirds percent (1 2/3%) of the member’s average monthly salary. Effective October 1, 1992, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance for all service for which a member was not classified as a police member or firefighter shall equal one and seventy-five hundredths percent (1.75%) of the member’s average monthly salary; effective October 1, 1993, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal one and eight hundred thirty-three thousandths percent (1.833%) of the member’s average monthly salary; effective October 1, 1994, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal one and nine hundred seventeen thousandths percent (1.917%); and effective June 30, 2000, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal two percent (2%) of the member’s average monthly salary. Entitlement to an annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall not vest until the effective date of that annual amount of accrued retirement allowance.

The annual amount of initial service retirement allowance of such a member shall equal paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, whichever is greater:\n\n(a) The member’s accrued retirement allowance; or\n\n(b) Five dollars ($5.00) multiplied by the number of months of credited service and by the bridging factor, as provided in section 59-1355, Idaho Code, between July 1, 1974, and the first of the month following the member’s final contribution.\n\n(2) The annual amount of accrued retirement allowance for each month of credited service for which a member was classified as a police member or firefighter shall equal two percent (2%) of the member’s average monthly salary. Effective October 1, 1992, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance for all service for which a member was classified as a police member or firefighter shall equal two and seventy-five thousandths percent (2.075%) of the member’s average monthly salary; effective October 1, 1993, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal two and fifteen hundredths percent (2.15%) of the member’s average monthly salary; effective October 1, 1994, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal two and two hundred twenty-five thousandths percent (2.225%); and effective June 30, 2000, the annual amount of accrued retirement allowance shall equal two and three-tenths percent (2.3%) of the member’s average monthly salary.

The retirement benefits shall be calculated on the amounts, terms and conditions in effect on the date of the final contribution by the member. The annual amount of initial service retirement allowance of such a member shall equal paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, whichever is greater:\n\n(a) The member’s accrued retirement allowance; or\n\n(b) Six dollars ($6.00) multiplied by the number of months of credited service and by the bridging factor, as provided in section 59-1355, Idaho Code, between July 1, 1974, and the first of the month following the member’s final contribution.\n\n(3) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to members and contingent annuitants of the retirement system and to members, annuitants and beneficiaries of the teachers and city systems. In any recomputation of an initial retirement allowance for a person not making a final contribution subsequent to 1974, the bridging factor referred to in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be 1.000. Any recomputed retirement allowance shall be payable only prospectively from July 1, 1974.\n\n(4) Benefits payable to a person who became a member prior to July 1, 1974, or to the member’s beneficiaries shall never be less than they would have received under this chapter as in effect on June 30, 1974; provided, however, that the member shall have accrued the amount of accumulated contributions required thereby prior to payment of an initial retirement allowance.\n\n(5)(a) If the majority of a member’s credited service is as an elected official or as an appointed official, including a member of the Idaho legislature who first took office after July 1, 2019, and that official was normally in the administrative offices of the employer less than twenty (20) hours per week during the term of office, or was normally not required to be present at any particular workstation for the employer twenty (20) hours per week or more during the term of office, that member’s initial service retirement allowance shall be the sum of:\n\n(i) That amount computed under subsection (1) and/or (2) of this section for only those months of service as an elected or an appointed official that are in excess of the months of other credited service, without consideration of any other credited service; and\n\n(ii) That accrued service retirement allowance that is computed from an average monthly salary for salary received during the member’s total months of credited service excluding those excess months referenced in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.\n\n(b) The initial service retirement allowance of members of the Idaho legislature who first took office on or before July 1, 2019, will be computed under subsection (1) and/or (2) of this section, on the basis of their total months of credited service.\n\n(6) In no case, however, will a member’s initial service retirement benefit be equal to more than the member’s accrued benefit as of May 1, 1990, or one hundred percent (100%) of the member’s average compensation for the three (3) consecutive years of employment that produce the greatest aggregate compensation, whichever is greater. If the benefit is calculated to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the member’s average compensation, the member shall be eligible for and may choose either:\n\n(a) An annual service retirement allowance equal to the member’s average annual compensation for the three (3) consecutive years of employment that produced the greatest aggregate compensation; or\n\n(b) A separation benefit.\n\n(7) The annual amount of initial service retirement allowance of a member who is over age seventy (70) years on the effective date of the member’s retirement shall be a percentage of the member’s initial service retirement allowance. Such percentage shall be one hundred percent (100%) increased as determined by the board to compensate for each month that the member’s retirement is deferred beyond age seventy (70) years.\n\n(8) A member’s accrued retirement allowance, as otherwise provided in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section, shall not be less than the minimum accrued retirement allowance provided in this subsection. The determination of the initial service retirement allowance provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, and the application of the provisions in subsections (6) and (7) of this section, will be made after the determination of the minimum accrued retirement allowance provided in this subsection.\n\nThis subsection shall apply to members who have at least two (2) separate periods of employment covered under this chapter where each separate period of employment would otherwise be eligible for a separation benefit described in section 59-1359, Idaho Code. For purposes of this subsection, if a separation of employment occurs that does not exceed sixty (60) consecutive calendar months, then the member’s period of employment shall be considered a continuous period of employment. For purposes of this subsection, the date of last contribution is the date of final contribution for each period or periods of employment.\n\nFor each separate period of employment considered under this subsection, the member must not have received a separation benefit for that period or, if he has received such a separation benefit under section 59-1359, Idaho Code, he must have completed reinstatement of all previous credited service associated with all separation benefits for all periods of employment as permitted under section 59-1360, Idaho Code.\n\nThe minimum accrued retirement allowance shall be equal to the largest accrued retirement allowance calculated at each date of last contribution based upon the benefit and eligibility provisions in effect as of the date of the last contribution made during such separate period of employment. For purposes of determining the accrued retirement allowance for each date of last contribution:\n\n(a) The member must have at least sixty (60) months of credited service at the date of last contribution;\n\n(b) The member’s months of credited service and average monthly salary are determined based solely on all periods of employment up to that date of last contribution, ignoring later periods of employment; and\n\n(c) The accrued retirement allowance computed for each period is multiplied by the bridging factor as provided in section 59-1355(3), Idaho Code, between the date of the last contribution made during that separate period of employment and the date of the member’s final contribution made during the last period of employment prior to retirement.\n\n[(59-1342) I.C., sec. 59-1319, as added by 1974, ch. 57, sec. 10, p. 1118; am. 1979, ch. 26, sec. 2, p. 41; am. 1985, ch. 168, sec. 2, p. 446; am. 1985, ch. 193, sec. 1, p. 492; am. and redesig. 1990, ch. 231, sec. 30, p. 633; am. 1990, ch. 249, sec. 4, p. 708; am. 1990, ch. 258, sec. 1, p. 738; am. 1991, ch. 61, sec. 4, p. 146; am. 1992, ch. 220, sec. 6, p. 666; am. 1992, ch. 342, sec. 2, p. 1042; am. 1994, ch. 276, sec. 3, p. 861; am. 1997, ch. 110, sec. 1, p. 266; am. 2000, ch. 209, sec. 1, p. 533; am. 2009, ch. 237, sec. 1, p. 729; am. 2019, ch. 75, sec. 1, p. 174.]",

The injury must be of such severity that it causes the loss of ability to maintain certifications required by the state of Idaho, the member’s department, or both. The injury shall be supported by evidence of one (1) or more of the following conditions:\n\n(i) Total, complete, permanent, and uncorrectable loss of sight in both eyes;\n\n(ii) Total, complete, permanent, and uncorrectable loss of hearing in both ears;\n\n(iii) Total, complete, and permanent loss of the ability to speak;\n\n(iv) Total, complete, and permanent loss of the use of one (1) or both feet at or above the ankle;\n\n(v) Total, complete, and permanent loss of the use of one (1) or both hands at or above the wrist;\n\n(vi) Injury to the spine that results in a total, permanent, and complete paralysis of both arms, both legs, or one (1) arm and one (1) leg; or\n\n(vii) An externally caused, physical traumatic injury to the brain that renders the member physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of a public safety officer.\n\n(b) \"Catastrophic line of duty benefits\" means benefits payable to a public safety officer who sustains a catastrophic injury pursuant to this section.\n\n(c) \"Public safety officer\" means a police officer member as set forth in section 59-1303, Idaho Code, or a firefighter member as set forth in section 59-1302(16), Idaho Code.\n\n(2) A public safety officer who sustains a catastrophic injury as set forth in this section is eligible for:\n\n(a) A onetime permanent catastrophic injury benefit in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); and\n\n(b) An ongoing annual benefit in an amount not less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) per year, to be adjusted every four (4) years pursuant to an actuarial study to determine the change in average public safety officer benefits over the previous four (4) years.\n\n(3) In the event a public safety officer receiving the catastrophic line of duty benefit as set forth in this section dies and leaves a surviving spouse to whom the member was married at the time of the catastrophic injury, such surviving spouse shall receive the catastrophic line of duty benefit for the duration of such spouse’s life to which the public safety officer would have been entitled.\n\n(4) The benefits payable under this section shall not be subject to Idaho state income tax.\n\n(5) A public safety officer who seeks to obtain benefits under this section shall apply to the retirement board within twelve (12) months of the date of the incident resulting in the public safety officer’s catastrophic injury.

This subsection shall no longer be in force and effect after June 30, 2026, however, the other provisions of this section shall remain in full force and effect and shall remain applicable to all employment.\n\n(6) A retired member as defined in section 59-1302(27), Idaho Code, with police officer status as defined in section 59-1303, Idaho Code, or with firefighter member status as defined in section 59-1302(16), Idaho Code, who retires on or after age fifty (50) years and who, within thirty (30) days after retiring, again becomes an employee as defined in section 59-1302(14), Idaho Code, with an employer participating in PERSI, or who is guaranteed reemployment with an employer participating in PERSI, shall be considered to have continued in the status of an employee and not to have separated from service. As a result of returning to employment with an employer as defined in section 59-1302(15), Idaho Code, the retired member may elect to continue receiving benefits and not to accrue additional service. In such a situation, contributions shall be made by the member and employer during the reemployment at the rate established by PERSI for police officer or firefighter members, as applicable, and any benefit payable on behalf of such member shall continue.

However, the other provisions of this section shall remain in full force and effect and shall remain applicable to all employment.\n\n(7) It is the responsibility of each employer to immediately report to the retirement board the employment of any retired member so that benefit payments can be suspended as provided in this section. If an employer fails to properly report the employment of a retired member and it results in the retirement board making benefit payments that should have been suspended, the employer shall, in addition to paying delinquent employee and employer contributions from the date of eligibility, also be responsible for repaying to the retirement board the benefit payments made to the retired member that should have been suspended, plus interest. The employer may then recoup such payments from the retired member.\n\n(8)(a) A retired member may provide services as a bona fide volunteer for an employer as defined in section 59-1302, Idaho Code, after retirement. Such service shall not be considered reemployment of a retired member, and a retired member who is a bona fide volunteer will not be considered to be an employee as defined in section 59-1302(14), Idaho Code.\n\n(b) A retired member shall not claim to be a bona fide volunteer unless such retired member qualifies as a bona fide volunteer pursuant to this subsection. Any retirement allowance payments received by a retired member who is not a bona fide volunteer shall be repaid to the system, such retired member’s retirement shall be negated, and the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this subsection, \"bona fide volunteer\" means an individual who performs service without promise, expectation, or receipt of any type of compensation, who is not performing a kind of work or service that would normally be compensated by an employer, and who is not classifying employment conduct as volunteering in an effort to avoid being considered an employee as defined in section 59-1302(14), Idaho Code.\n\n[(59-1356) 59-1318, added 1963, ch. 349, Art. 5, sec. 8, p. 988; am. 1969, ch. 283, sec. 7, p. 856; am. 1974, ch. 57, sec. 9, p. 1118; am. 1981, ch. 10, sec. 7, p. 19; am. and redesig. 1990, ch. 231, sec. 44, p. 639; am. 1996, ch. 243, sec. 1, p. 773; am. 1999, ch. 198, sec. 5, p. 518; am. 2006, ch. 151, sec. 1, p. 466; am. 2006, ch. 185, sec. 1, p. 585; am. 2007, ch. 44, sec. 3, p. 111; am. 2007, ch. 45, sec. 1, p. 114; am. 2007, ch. 131, sec. 2, p. 388; am. 2008, ch. 27, sec. 16, p. 54; am. 2012, ch. 169, sec. 2, p. 449; am. 2017, ch. 80, sec. 1, p. 223; am. 2019, ch. 202, sec. 1, p. 620; am. 2021, ch. 204, sec. 2, p. 555; am. 2022, ch. 216, sec. 6, p. 697; am. 2023, ch. 91, sec. 1, p. 285; am. 2025, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 36.]",
