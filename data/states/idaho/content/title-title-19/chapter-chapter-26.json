      "text": "19-2601. COMMUTATION, SUSPENSION, WITHHOLDING OF SENTENCE — PROBATION. Whenever any person shall have been convicted, or enter a plea of guilty, in any district court of the state of Idaho, of or to any crime against the laws of the state, except those of treason or murder, the court in its discretion may:\n\n1. Commute the sentence and confine the defendant in the county jail, or, if the defendant is of proper age, commit the defendant to the custody of the state department of juvenile corrections;\n\n2. Suspend the execution of the judgment at the time of judgment or at any time during the term of a sentence in the county jail and may place the defendant on probation under such terms and conditions as it deems necessary and appropriate;\n\n3. Withhold judgment on such terms and for such time as it may prescribe and may place the defendant on probation under such terms and conditions as it deems necessary and appropriate; or\n\n4. Suspend the execution of the judgment at any time during the first three hundred sixty-five (365) days of a sentence to the custody of the state board of correction. The court may retain jurisdiction over the prisoner for a period of up to the first three hundred sixty-five (365) days. Except as provided for in section 19-2601A, Idaho Code, during the period of retained jurisdiction, the state board of correction shall be responsible for determining the placement of the prisoner and such education, programming and treatment as it determines to be appropriate. The prisoner will remain committed to the board of correction if not affirmatively placed on probation by the court. In extraordinary circumstances, where the court concludes that it is unable to obtain and evaluate the relevant information within the period of retained jurisdiction, or where the court concludes that a hearing is required and is unable to obtain the defendant’s presence for such a hearing within such period, the court may decide whether to place the defendant on probation or release jurisdiction within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, after the period of retained jurisdiction has expired. Placement on probation shall be under such terms and conditions as the court deems necessary and appropriate. The court in its discretion may sentence a defendant to more than one (1) period of retained jurisdiction after a defendant has been placed on probation in a case or following release from commitment to the department of juvenile corrections pursuant to section 19-2601A, Idaho Code. In no case shall the board of correction or its agent, the department of correction, be required to hold a hearing of any kind with respect to a recommendation to the court for the grant or denial of probation. Probation is a matter left to the sound discretion of the court. Any recommendation made by the state board of correction to the court regarding the prisoner shall be in the nature of an addendum to the presentence report. The board of correction and its agency, the department of correction, and their employees shall not be held financially responsible for damages, injunctive or declaratory relief for any recommendation made to the district court under this section.\n\n5. If the crime involved is a felony and if judgment is withheld as provided in subsection 3. of this section or if judgment and a sentence of custody to the state board of correction is suspended at the time of judgment in accordance with subsection 2. of this section or as provided by subsection 4. of this section, the court may place the defendant on probation. If the court places the defendant on probation to the board of correction, the court shall include in the terms and conditions of probation a requirement that the defendant enter into and comply with an agreement of supervision with the board of correction. The agreement of supervision shall include provisions setting forth the potential sanctions for a violation of the terms or conditions imposed and potential rewards for compliance with the terms and conditions imposed, as such sanctions and rewards are set forth in rules of the board of correction.\n\n6. If the crime involved is a misdemeanor, indictable or otherwise, or if the court should suspend any remaining portion of a jail sentence already commuted in accordance with subsection 1. of this section, the court, if it grants probation, may place the defendant on probation.\n\n7. The period of probation ordered by a court under this section under a conviction or plea of guilty for a misdemeanor, indictable or otherwise, may be for a period of not more than two (2) years; provided that the court may extend the period of probation to include the period of time during which the defendant is a participant in a problem solving court program and for a period of up to one (1) year after a defendant’s graduation or termination from a problem solving court program. Under a conviction or plea of guilty for a felony the period of probation may be for a period of not more than the maximum period for which the defendant might have been imprisoned.\n\n[19-2601, added 1972, ch. 336, sec. 9, p. 989; am. 1972, ch. 381, sec. 16, p. 1102; am. 1973, ch. 292, sec. 1, p. 615; am. 1974, ch. 68, sec. 1, p. 1149; am. 1980, ch. 176, sec. 1, p. 374; am. 1994, ch. 33, sec. 1, p. 50; am. 1995, ch. 247, sec. 1, p. 817; am. 1996, ch. 418, sec. 1, p. 1388; am. 1998, ch. 67, sec. 1, p. 260; am. 2000, ch. 246, sec. 1, p. 686; am. 2005, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 572; am. 2010, ch. 350, sec. 1, p. 913; am. 2012, ch. 46, sec. 1, p. 140; am. 2014, ch. 150, sec. 4, p. 418; am. 2015, ch. 113, sec. 2, p. 281; am. 2018, ch. 125, sec. 1, p. 264.]",

(1) If the convicted juvenile is a juvenile held for adult criminal proceedings, the court may suspend execution of judgment of a sentence, retain jurisdiction and issue an order committing the convicted juvenile to dual custody with the state board of correction and the department of juvenile corrections.\n\n(2) During this period of dual custody and retained jurisdiction:\n\n(a) The department of juvenile corrections shall assume physical custody of and financial responsibility for the convicted juvenile from the time of the court’s order until the court terminates the department’s custody, jurisdiction is relinquished or the juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age, whichever occurs first;\n\n(b) The department of juvenile corrections shall be responsible for determining the placement of the convicted juvenile and such education, programming and treatment as it determines to be appropriate. However, court approval is required by the sentencing court prior to the department placing a convicted juvenile in a community residential setting;\n\n(c) The state board of correction shall be a member of the convicted juvenile’s treatment team. The state board of correction shall participate in staffings and shall provide supervision pursuant to section 20-219, Idaho Code, if the convicted juvenile is placed in a community residential setting by the department of juvenile corrections. During this period of supervision, the state board of correction shall not file a probation violation, but may petition the court to terminate the custody of the department pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection;\n\n(d) While the convicted juvenile is in the physical custody of the department of juvenile corrections, if either the department or the state board of correction reasonably believes that the juvenile is failing to comply with all reasonable program requirements, the department or the state board of correction may petition the sentencing court to terminate custody of the department. If the juvenile has successfully completed the program or is sixty (60) days or less from turning twenty-one (21) years of age, the department of juvenile corrections shall return the convicted juvenile to the court for further disposition;\n\n(e) Any recommendation made by the state board of correction or the department of juvenile corrections to the court regarding the convicted juvenile shall be in the nature of an addendum to the presentence report; and\n\n(f) Upon the release of the juvenile by the department of juvenile corrections, its duties and obligations cease and custody of the convicted juvenile with the department is terminated.\n\n(3) All time served under the custody of the department of juvenile corrections shall be credited toward the total sentence given the convicted juvenile. However, in no event may the total of the actual time spent by the convicted juvenile in the custody of the department, plus any adult sentence imposed by the court, exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime.\n\n(4) Upon the release of the convicted juvenile by the department of juvenile corrections or termination of department custody, the court may impose another period of retained jurisdiction pursuant to subsection 4. of section 19-2601, Idaho Code, relinquish jurisdiction and impose the remainder of the sentence with the state board of correction, or place the convicted juvenile on adult felony probation.\n\n[19-2601A, added 2015, ch. 113, sec. 3, p. 283.]",
