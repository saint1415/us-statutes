A centralized data repository to manage and link data across separate entities will aid in evaluating the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and enable data-driven, cost-saving decision-making on issues facing the criminal justice system in Idaho. The Criminal Justice Integrated Data System establishes the legal framework by which the various contributing entities may share, integrate, merge, observe, examine, and research siloed data in a way that protects sensitive or legally protected personal information.\n\n[19-4802, added 2020, ch. 239, sec. 1, p. 697.]",
