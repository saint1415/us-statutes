      "text": "19-6203. ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY — ELIGIBILITY. (1) Judicial officers desiring that their Idaho residential street address and telephone number and the Idaho residential street address and telephone number of their residing household members be exempt from disclosure pursuant to this chapter and sections 34-704(6) and 74-106(30), Idaho Code, may submit an application and a fee, if any, to the custodian of the public record that contains such information. Upon receipt of such application and fee, the public agency shall comply with the provisions of this chapter for a period of four (4) years. Thereafter, judicial officers may renew the exemption by submitting a new application and fee, if any. The public agency may establish a fee schedule not to exceed the actual cost to the agency of complying with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) Judicial officers may submit an application to a public agency requesting that the public agency use an alternative Idaho mailing address rather than the Idaho residential street address of any such officer and of any such officer’s residing household members on all applications and on all identification cards, licenses, certificates, permits, tags, and other similar documents that are issued to the officer or to such officer’s residing household members by the public agency. A public agency receiving such application shall comply with the request.\n\n(3) A person shall cease to be eligible for an exemption under this chapter if such person ceases to be a judicial officer or a residing household member. Within thirty (30) days of such cessation, the person shall notify, in writing, every public agency to which the person has made an application stating that he is no longer eligible for such exemption. If a judicial officer changes employment but is still eligible for an exemption under this chapter, such judicial officer shall, within thirty (30) days of changing employment, submit a new application to every public agency to which such officer has made an application.\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public agency from obtaining the Idaho residential street address and telephone number of a judicial officer and of any residing household member. A judicial officer who has submitted an application pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall provide his current Idaho residential street address to his employing entity. The judicial officer’s employing entity, or any public agency that has obtained the Idaho residential street address of a judicial officer, shall upon request identify the county in which the judicial officer’s Idaho residential street address is situated.\n\n[(19-6203) 19-6003, added 2023, ch. 179, sec. 1, p. 483; am. and redesig. 2024, ch. 16, sec. 5, p. 139; am. 2025, ch. 113, sec. 28, p. 614.]",
