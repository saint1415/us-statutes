The defendant must file any claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel within forty-two (42) days of the Idaho supreme court issuing the final remittitur in the unified appeal from which no further proceedings except issuance of a death warrant are ordered.\n\n(4) Any remedy available by post-conviction procedure, habeas corpus or any other provision of state law must be pursued according to the procedures set forth in this section and within the time limitations of subsection (3) of this section.

All issues relating to conviction, sentence and post-conviction challenge shall be considered in the same appellate proceeding.\n\n(7) If post-conviction challenge is made under this section, questions raised thereby shall be heard and decided by the district court within ninety (90) days of the filing of any motion or petition for relief timely filed as provided by this section. The court shall give first priority to capital cases. In the event the district court fails to act within the time specified, the supreme court of Idaho shall, on its own motion or the motion of any party, order the court to proceed forthwith, or if appropriate, reassign the case to another judge.

Such showing must be made under oath and the district court’s finding that extraordinary circumstances exist for extending the time shall be in writing and shall be immediately reported to the supreme court, which shall at once independently consider the sufficiency of the circumstances shown and determine whether an extension of time is warranted.\n\n(9) When a judgment imposing the penalty of death is filed, the clerk and the reporter shall begin preparation of the transcripts of the trial, and other proceedings, and the clerk’s transcript.\n\n(10) When the procedures specified in this section and section 19-2827, Idaho Code, have been carried out and a remittitur issued, and an execution date set as provided by law, the defendant shall be deemed to have exhausted all state remedies.\n\n(11) Any successive petition for post-conviction relief not within the exception of subsection (5) of this section shall be dismissed summarily.

      "text": "19-2720. INQUIRY INTO NEED FOR NEW COUNSEL. After the imposition of a sentence of death, the trial judge should advise the defendant that, upon a particularized showing that there is a reasonable basis to litigate a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, new counsel may be appointed to represent the defendant to pursue such a claim in a post-conviction proceeding. If no such request is made, the trial judge shall certify of record that there are no facts that have come to the court’s attention upon which such a claim could reasonably be based or, alternatively, the court may appoint new counsel. No deficiency in the application of the procedure described herein shall be grounds for relief from a judgment of conviction or from a sentence.\n\n[(19-2720) 19-2719A, added 1995, ch. 140, sec. 4, p. 598; am. and redesig. 2005, ch. 25, sec. 14, p. 91.]",
