(1) Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the person about to be injured:\n\n(a) To prevent an offense against his person, or his family, or some member thereof; or\n\n(b) To prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession.\n\n(2) The defensive display or declaration of a firearm by a person is justified when and to the extent a reasonable person would believe that physical force is necessary to protect the person or another person against the use or attempted use of unlawful physical force, including deadly force. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to someone who intentionally provokes another person to use or attempt to use unlawful physical force or deadly physical force. For purposes of this section, \"defensive display or declaration of a firearm\" shall include:\n\n(a) Verbally informing another person that the person possesses or has available a firearm; and\n\n(b) Exposing, displaying, or placing a person’s hand on a firearm while the firearm is contained in a holster, pocket, purse, or other means of containment or transport in a manner that a reasonable person would understand was meant to protect the person or another against an unlawful use or attempted use of physical force or deadly physical force.\n\n(3) The provisions of this section do not require a defensive display or declaration of a firearm before the use of physical force or deadly physical force, or threat of physical force or deadly physical force, by a person who is otherwise justified in the use or threatened use of physical force or deadly physical force.\n\n(4) A person acting pursuant to this section may use such degree and extent of force as would appear to be reasonably necessary to prevent the threatened injury.

A person confronted with such danger has a clear right to act upon appearances such as would influence the action of a reasonable person.\n\n(3) In the exercise of the right of self-defense or defense of another, a person need not retreat from any place that person has a right to be. A person may stand his ground and defend himself or another person by the use of all force and means which would appear to be necessary to a reasonable person in a similar situation and with similar knowledge without the benefit of hindsight. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a person incarcerated in jail or prison facilities when interacting with jail or prison staff who are acting in their official capacities.\n\n(4) In any prosecution for the unlawful use of force, including deadly force, or the attempted or threatened use of force contrary to title 18, Idaho Code, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of force, attempted use of force or threat to use force was not justifiable.\n\n(5) A person using force or deadly force in defense of a habitation, place of business or employment or occupied vehicle as defined in section 18-4009(3), Idaho Code, is presumed to have acted reasonably and had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the force is used against a person whose entry or attempted entry therein is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, or in a violent and tumultuous manner, or surreptitiously or by stealth, or for the purpose of committing a felony.\n\n[19-202A, added 1974, ch. 238, sec. 1, p. 1601; am. 2018, ch. 222, sec. 5, p. 502.]",
