      "text": "19-5803. ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY — ELIGIBILITY. (1) Law enforcement officers desiring that their Idaho residential street address and telephone number, and the Idaho residential street address and telephone number of their residing household member(s) be exempt from disclosure pursuant to this chapter and section 74-106(30), Idaho Code, may submit an application and a fee, if any, to the custodian of the public record that contains such information. Upon receipt of an application and fee, the public agency shall comply with the provisions of this chapter for a period of four (4) years. Thereafter, law enforcement officers may renew the exemption by submitting a new application and fee, if any. The public agency may establish a fee schedule not to exceed the actual cost to the agency of complying with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) Law enforcement officers may submit an application to a public agency requesting that the public agency use an alternative Idaho mailing address rather than the Idaho residential street address of any such officer and of any such officer’s residing household member(s) on all applications and on all identification cards, licenses, certificates, permits, tags and other similar documents that are issued to the officer or to such officer’s residing household member(s) by the public agency. A public agency receiving such application shall comply with the request.\n\n(3) A person shall cease to be eligible for an exemption under this chapter if such person ceases to be a law enforcement officer or a residing household member(s). Within thirty (30) days of such cessation, the person shall notify, in writing, every public agency to which the person has made an application stating that he or she is no longer eligible for such exemption. If a law enforcement officer changes employment but is still eligible for an exemption under this chapter, such law enforcement officer shall, within thirty (30) days of changing employment, submit a new application to every public agency to which such officer has made an application.\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public agency from obtaining the residential street address and telephone number of a law enforcement officer and of any residing household member(s). A law enforcement officer who has submitted an application pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall provide his or her current Idaho residential street address to his or her employing entity.\n\n[19-5803, added 2010, ch. 225, sec. 2, p. 506; am. 2011, ch. 151, sec. 9, p. 422; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 22, p. 403.]",
