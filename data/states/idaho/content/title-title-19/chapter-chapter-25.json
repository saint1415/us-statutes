Information concerning the victim and the impact that the death or aggravated lewd conduct of the victim has had on the victim’s family is relevant and admissible. Such information shall be designed to demonstrate the victim’s uniqueness as an individual human being and the resultant loss to the community or impact caused by the victim’s death or lewd conduct of the victim. Characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant and the appropriate sentence shall not be permitted as part of any victim impact information. The special sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant with the consent of the prosecuting attorney.\n\n(b) If the defendant’s guilt was determined by a jury verdict, the same jury shall hear the special sentencing proceeding; provided however, that if it is impracticable to reconvene the same jury to hear the special sentencing proceeding due to an insufficient number of jurors, the trial court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury of twelve (12) persons, plus alternate jurors as the trial court deems necessary pursuant to section 19-1904, Idaho Code.\n\n(c) If the defendant’s guilt was determined by a plea of guilty or by a decision of the trial court sitting without a jury, or if a retrial of the special sentencing proceeding is necessary for any reason including, but not limited to, a mistrial in a previous special sentencing proceeding or as a consequence of a remand from an appellate court, the trial court shall impanel a jury of twelve (12) persons, plus alternate jurors as the trial court deems necessary pursuant to section 19-1904, Idaho Code, unless such jury is waived.\n\n(d) If a special sentencing proceeding is conducted before a newly impaneled jury pursuant to the provisions of subsection (5)(b) or (5)(c) of this section, the state and the defense may present evidence to inform the jury of the nature and circumstances of the murder or aggravated lewd conduct for which the defendant was convicted. The newly impaneled jury shall be instructed that the defendant has previously been found guilty of first-degree murder or aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or under and that the jury’s purpose is limited to making findings relevant for sentencing.\n\n(6) At the special sentencing proceeding, the state and the defendant shall be entitled to present all relevant evidence in aggravation and mitigation. Disclosure of evidence to be relied on in the sentencing proceeding shall be made in accordance with Idaho criminal rule 16. Evidence admitted at trial shall be considered and need not be repeated at the sentencing hearing.\n\n(7) The jury shall be informed as follows:\n\n(a) If the jury finds that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists and no mitigating circumstances exist which would make the imposition of the death penalty unjust, the defendant will be sentenced to death by the court.\n\n(b) If the jury finds the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance but finds that the existence of mitigating circumstances makes the imposition of the death penalty unjust or the jury cannot unanimously agree on whether the existence of mitigating circumstances makes the imposition of the death penalty unjust, the defendant will be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; and\n\n(c) If the jury does not find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance or if the jury cannot unanimously agree on the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the defendant will be sentenced by the court to a term of life imprisonment with a fixed term of not less than ten (10) years for first-degree murder or thirty (30) years for aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or under.\n\n(8) Upon the conclusion of the evidence and arguments in mitigation and aggravation:\n\n(a) With regard to each statutory aggravating circumstance alleged by the state, the jury shall return a special verdict stating:\n\n(i) Whether the statutory aggravating circumstance has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and\n\n(ii) If the statutory aggravating circumstance has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whether all mitigating circumstances, when weighed against the aggravating circumstance, are sufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust.\n\n(b) If a jury has been waived, the court shall:\n\n(i) Make written findings setting forth any statutory aggravating circumstance found beyond a reasonable doubt;\n\n(ii) Set forth in writing any mitigating circumstances considered; and\n\n(iii) Upon weighing all mitigating circumstances against each statutory aggravating circumstance separately, determine whether mitigating circumstances are found to be sufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust and detail in writing its reasons for so finding.\n\n(9) The following are statutory aggravating circumstances, at least one (1) of which must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt before a sentence of death can be imposed for murder in the first degree:\n\n(a) The defendant was previously convicted of another murder.\n\n(b) At the time the murder was committed the defendant also committed another murder.\n\n(c) The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\n\n(d) The murder was committed for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or the defendant employed another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration.\n\n(e) The murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\n\n(f) By the murder, or circumstances surrounding its commission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life.\n\n(g) The murder was committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, arson, rape, robbery, burglary, kidnapping or mayhem and the defendant killed, intended a killing, or acted with reckless indifference to human life.\n\n(h) The murder was committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor, sexual abuse of a child under sixteen (16) years of age, ritualized abuse of a child, sexual exploitation of a child, sexual battery of a minor child sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years of age, or forcible sexual penetration by use of a foreign object, and the defendant killed, intended a killing, or acted with reckless indifference to human life.\n\n(i) The defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murder at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\n\n(j) The murder was committed against a former or present peace officer, executive officer, officer of the court, judicial officer or prosecuting attorney because of the exercise of official duty or because of the victim’s former or present official status.\n\n(k) The murder was committed against a witness or potential witness in a criminal or civil legal proceeding because of such proceeding.\n\n(10) The following are statutory aggravating circumstances, at least three (3) of which must be found to have existed during the commission of or to accomplish the lewd conduct beyond a reasonable doubt before a sentence of death can be imposed for aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or under, as provided in section 18-1508C, Idaho Code:\n\n(a) The defendant engaged in three (3) or more incidents of lewd conduct of a child involving the same victim on separate occasions;\n\n(b) The defendant penetrated, however slight, the oral, anal, or vaginal opening of the victim with a penis;\n\n(c) The victim was kidnapped as defined in section 18-4501, Idaho Code;\n\n(d) The defendant committed the crime of human trafficking, as defined in section 18-8602, Idaho Code, against the victim;\n\n(e) The defendant has been found guilty of or has plead guilty to any offense requiring sex offender registration as set forth in section 18-8304, Idaho Code;\n\n(f) The defendant was, at the time of the offense, in a position of trust, or had supervisory or disciplinary power over the victim by virtue of the defendant’s legal, professional, or occupational status and used the position of trust or power to accomplish the lewd conduct;

      "text": "19-2515A. IMPOSITION OF DEATH PENALTY UPON MENTALLY RETARDED PERSON PROHIBITED. (1) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Mentally retarded\" means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two (2) of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social or interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health and safety. The onset of significant subaverage general intelligence functioning and significant limitations in adaptive functioning must occur before age eighteen (18) years.\n\n(b) \"Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\" means an intelligence quotient of seventy (70) or below.\n\n(2) In any case in which the state has provided notice of an intent to seek the death penalty pursuant to section 18-4004A, Idaho Code, and where the defendant intends to claim that he is mentally retarded and call expert witnesses concerning such issue, the defendant shall give notice to the court and the state of such intention at least ninety (90) days in advance of trial, or such other period as justice may require, and shall apply for an order directing that a mental retardation hearing be conducted. Upon receipt of such application, the court shall promptly conduct a hearing without a jury to determine whether the defendant is mentally retarded; provided however, that no court shall, over the objection of any party, receive the evidence of any expert witness on the issue of mental retardation unless such evidence is fully subject to the adversarial process in at least the following particulars:\n\n(a) If a defendant fails to provide notice as required in this subsection, an expert witness shall not be permitted to testify until such time as the state has a complete opportunity to consider the substance of such testimony and prepare for rebuttal through such opposing experts as the state may choose.\n\n(b) A party who expects to call an expert witness to testify on the issue of mental retardation shall, on a schedule to be set by the court, furnish to the opposing party a written synopsis of the findings of such expert or a copy of a written report. The court may authorize the taking of depositions to inquire further into the substance of such synopsis or report.\n\n(c) Raising the issue of mental retardation shall constitute a waiver of any privilege that might otherwise be interposed to bar the production of evidence on the subject and, upon request, the court shall order that the state’s experts shall have access to the defendant in such cases for the purpose of having its own experts conduct an examination in preparation for any legal proceeding at which the defendant’s mental retardation may be in issue.\n\n(d) The court is authorized to appoint at least one (1) expert at public expense upon a showing by an indigent defendant that there is a need to inquire into questions of the defendant’s mental retardation. The defendant shall pay the costs of examination if he is financially able. The determination of ability to pay shall be made in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code. The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n\n(e) If an examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the defendant to cooperate with either a court-appointed examiner or with any state expert, the examiner or expert shall so advise the court in writing and include, if possible, an opinion as to whether such unwillingness of the defendant was the result of mental retardation. The court may consider the defendant’s lack of cooperation for its effect on the credibility of the defendant’s mental retardation claim.\n\n(3) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally retarded, the death penalty shall not be imposed. The jury shall not be informed of the mental retardation hearing or the court’s findings concerning the defendant’s claim of mental retardation.\n\n(4) In the event of a conviction of first-degree murder of a person who has been found to be mentally retarded pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a special sentencing proceeding shall be held promptly to determine whether the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any of the statutory aggravating circumstances set forth in subsections 19-2515(9)(a) through (k), Idaho Code.\n\n(a) The special sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant with the consent of the prosecuting attorney.\n\n(i) If the defendant’s guilt was determined by a jury verdict, the same jury shall hear the special sentencing proceeding; provided however, that if it is impracticable to reconvene the same jury to hear the special sentencing proceeding due to an insufficient number of jurors, the trial court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury of twelve (12) persons, plus alternate jurors as the trial court deems necessary pursuant to section 19-1904, Idaho Code.\n\n(ii) If the defendant’s guilt was determined by a plea of guilty or by a decision of the trial court sitting without a jury, or if a retrial of the special sentencing proceeding is necessary for any reason including, but not limited to, a mistrial in a previous special sentencing proceeding or as a consequence of a remand from an appellate court, the trial court shall impanel a jury of twelve (12) persons, plus alternate jurors as the trial court deems necessary pursuant to section 19-1904, Idaho Code, unless such jury is waived.\n\n(iii) If a special sentencing proceeding is conducted before a newly impaneled jury, the state and the defense may present evidence to inform the jury of the nature and circumstances of the murder for which the defendant was convicted. The newly impaneled jury shall be instructed that the defendant has previously been found guilty of first-degree murder and that the jury’s purpose is limited to making findings relevant for sentencing.\n\n(b) At the special sentencing proceeding, the state and the defendant shall be entitled to present all evidence relevant to the determination of whether or not a statutory aggravating circumstance has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Disclosure of evidence to be relied on in the sentencing proceeding shall be made in accordance with Idaho criminal rule 16. Evidence admitted at trial shall be considered and need not be repeated at the sentencing hearing.\n\n(c) If a unanimous jury, or the court if a jury is waived, finds the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the court shall impose a fixed life sentence. If a unanimous jury, or the court if a jury is waived, does not find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the court shall impose a life sentence with a minimum period of confinement of not less than ten (10) years during which period of confinement the defendant shall not be eligible for parole or discharge or credit or reduction of sentence for good conduct, except for meritorious service.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section is intended to alter the application of any rule of evidence or limit or extend the right of any party to assert any claim or defense otherwise available to that party.\n\n(6) Any remedy available by post-conviction procedure or habeas corpus shall be pursued according to the procedures and time limits set forth in section 19-2719, Idaho Code.\n\n[19-2515A, added 2003, ch. 136, sec. 4, p. 398; am. 2006, ch. 129, sec. 2, p. 378.]",

The goals of sentencing include the primary consideration of the protection of society, followed by the possibility of risk reduction through rehabilitation, deterrence of the individual and the public generally, and punishment or retribution for wrongdoing and the impact on the victim; and\n\n(b) Each discretionary sentence should be specifically tailored to the individual defendant and take into account the totality of all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\n(2) The following factors, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in favor of avoiding a sentence of imprisonment:\n\n(a) The defendant’s criminal conduct neither caused nor threatened harm;\n\n(b) The defendant did not contemplate that his criminal conduct would cause or threaten harm;\n\n(c) The defendant’s criminogenic needs indicate that the defendant will benefit from supervision and treatment in the community;\n\n(d) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant’s criminal conduct, though failing to establish a defense;\n\n(e) The victim of the defendant’s criminal conduct induced or facilitated the commission of the crime;\n\n(f) The defendant has compensated or will compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that was sustained; provided, however, nothing in this section shall prevent the appropriate use of imprisonment and restitution in combination;\n\n(g) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime;\n\n(h) The defendant’s criminal conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;\n\n(i) The character and attitudes of the defendant indicate that the commission of another crime is unlikely; and\n\n(j) The defendant demonstrates amenability to treatment.\n\n(3) The following factors, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in favor of a sentence of imprisonment:\n\n(a) There is undue risk that during the period of a suspended sentence or probation the defendant will commit another crime harmful to another person;\n\n(b) A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the defendant’s crime;\n\n(c) Imprisonment will provide appropriate punishment and deterrent to the defendant;\n\n(d) Imprisonment will provide an appropriate deterrent for other persons in the community; and\n\n(e) The defendant is a multiple offender or professional criminal.\n\n(4) As used in this section, \"criminogenic needs\" means those dynamic factors associated with the likelihood of reoffending but that may be changed through effective intervention.\n\n[(19-2521) 19-2520 added 1977, ch. 46, sec. 1, p. 85; am. and redesig. 1993, ch. 86, sec. 1, p. 215; am. and redesig. 1993, ch. 101, sec. 1, p. 255; am. 2014, ch. 150, sec. 2, p. 414; am. 2020, ch. 210, sec. 1, p. 616.]",

(1) If there is reason to believe the mental condition of the defendant will be a significant factor at sentencing and for good cause shown, the court shall appoint at least one (1) psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant. The costs of examination shall be paid by the defendant if he is financially able. The determination of ability to pay shall be made in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code. The order appointing or requesting the designation of a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist shall specify the issues to be resolved for which the examiner is appointed or designated.\n\n(2) In making such examination, any method may be employed which is accepted by the examiner’s profession for the examination of those alleged to be suffering from a mental illness or defect.\n\n(3) The report of the examination shall include the following:\n\n(a) A description of the nature of the examination;\n\n(b) A diagnosis, evaluation or prognosis of the mental condition of the defendant;\n\n(c) An analysis of the degree of the defendant’s illness or defect and level of functional impairment;\n\n(d) A consideration of whether treatment is available for the defendant’s mental condition;\n\n(e) An analysis of the relative risks and benefits of treatment or nontreatment;\n\n(f) A consideration of the risk of danger which the defendant may create for the public if at large.\n\n(4) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n\n(5) When the defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of his own choice, such examiner shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the defendant for the purpose of examination.\n\n(6) If a mental health examination of the defendant has previously been conducted, whether pursuant to section 19-2524, Idaho Code, or for any other purpose, and a report of such examination has been submitted to the court, and if the court determines that such examination and report provide the necessary information required in subsection (3) of this section, and the examination is sufficiently recent to reflect the defendant’s present mental condition, then the court may consider such prior examination and report as the examination and report required by this section and need not order an additional examination of the defendant’s mental condition. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to examinations and reports performed or prepared pursuant to section 18-211 or 18-212, Idaho Code, for the purpose of determining the defendant’s fitness to proceed, unless the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently consents to having such examination and report used at sentencing.\n\n(7) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the consideration of other evidence relevant to the imposition of sentence.\n\n[19-2522, added 1982, ch. 368, sec. 9, p. 925; am. 2009, ch. 124, sec. 1, p. 390; am. 2012, ch. 225, sec. 1, p. 611.]",

In determining the sentence to be imposed in addition to other criteria provided by law, if the defendant’s mental condition is a significant factor, the court shall consider such factors as:\n\n(a) The extent to which the defendant is mentally ill;\n\n(b) The degree of illness or defect and level of functional impairment;\n\n(c) The prognosis for improvement or rehabilitation;\n\n(d) The availability of treatment and level of care required;\n\n(e) Any risk of danger which the defendant may create for the public, if at large, or the absence of such risk;\n\n(f) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the offense charged.\n\n(2) The court shall authorize treatment during the period of confinement or probation specified in the sentence if, after the sentencing hearing, it concludes by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(a) The defendant suffers from a severe and reliably diagnosable mental illness or defect resulting in the defendant’s inability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law;\n\n(b) Without treatment, the immediate prognosis is for major distress resulting in serious mental or physical deterioration of the defendant;\n\n(c) Treatment is available for such illness or defect;\n\n(d) The relative risks and benefits of treatment or nontreatment are such that a reasonable person would consent to treatment.

(1) After a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a felony, and at any time thereafter while the court exercises jurisdiction over the defendant, behavioral health needs determinations shall be conducted when and as provided by this section.\n\n(a) As part of the presentence process, a screening to determine whether a defendant is in need of a substance use disorder assessment and/or a mental health examination shall be made in every felony case unless the court waives the requirement for a screening. The screening shall be performed within seven (7) days after the plea of guilty or finding of guilt.\n\n(b) At any time after sentencing while the court exercises jurisdiction over the defendant, the court may order such a screening to be performed by individuals authorized or approved by the department of correction if the court determines that one is indicated. The screening shall be performed within seven (7) days after the order of the court requiring such screening.\n\n(2) Substance use disorder provisions.\n\n(a) Should a screening indicate the need for further assessment of a substance use disorder, the necessary assessment shall be timely performed so as to avoid any unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding and not later than thirty-five (35) days after a plea of guilty or finding of guilt or other order of the court requiring such screening. The assessment may be performed by qualified employees of the department of correction or by private providers approved by the department of health and welfare. If the screening or assessment is not timely completed, the court may order that the screening be performed by another qualified provider.\n\n(b) Following completion of the assessment, the results of the assessment, including a determination of whether the defendant meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder and the recommended level of care, shall be submitted to the court as part of the presentence investigation report or other department of correction report to the court.\n\n(c) Following the entry of a plea of guilty or a finding of guilt, the court may order, as a condition of the defendant’s continued release on bail or on the defendant’s own recognizance, that, if the assessment reflects that the defendant meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, the defendant shall promptly, and prior to sentencing, begin treatment at the recommended level of care.\n\n(d) If the court concludes at sentencing, or at any time after sentencing while the court exercises jurisdiction over the defendant, that the defendant meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, and if the court places the defendant on probation, the court may order the defendant, as a condition of probation, to undergo treatment at the recommended level of care, subject to modification of the level of care by the court. If substance use disorder treatment is ordered, all treatment shall be performed by a qualified private provider approved by the department of health and welfare. The court may order that, if the level of care placement or the treatment plan is modified in any material term, the department of correction shall notify the court stating the reason for the modifications and informing the court as to the clinical alternatives available to the defendant. The level of care for substance use treatment shall be based on each probationer’s risk assessment with priority given to probationers with high or moderate risk levels.\n\n(e) In no event shall the persons or facility doing the substance use assessment be the person or facility that provides the substance use treatment unless this requirement is waived by the court or where the assessment and treatment are provided by or through a federally recognized Indian tribe or federal military installation where diagnosis and treatment are appropriate and available.\n\n(f) Defendants who have completed department of correction institutional programs may receive aftercare services from qualified employees of the department of correction.\n\n(g) The expenses of all screenings and assessments for substance use disorder provided or ordered pursuant to this section shall be borne by the department of correction. The expenses for treatment provided or ordered pursuant to this section shall be borne by the department of correction unless the defendant is placed in a treatment program that is funded by an alternate source. The department of correction shall be entitled to any payment received by the defendant or to which he may be entitled from any public or private source available to the department of correction for the service provided to the defendant. The department of correction may promulgate rules for a schedule of fees to be charged to the defendant for the substance use disorder assessments and treatments provided to the defendant based on the actual costs of such services and the ability of the defendant to pay. The department of correction shall determine costs pursuant to section 39-3140, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) Mental health provisions.\n\n(a) Should the mental health screening indicate that a serious mental illness may be present, then the department of correction shall refer the defendant to the department of health and welfare for further examination. The examination shall be timely performed so as to avoid any unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding and not later than thirty-five (35) days after a plea of guilty or finding of guilt or other order of the court requiring such screening.\n\n(b) The examination may be performed by qualified department of health and welfare employees or by private providers under contract with the department of health and welfare, provided that such examination shall at a minimum include an in-depth evaluation of the following:\n\n(i) Mental health concerns;\n\n(ii) Psychosocial risk factors;\n\n(iii) Medical, psychiatric, developmental and other relevant history;\n\n(iv) Functional impairments;\n\n(v) Mental status examination;\n\n(vi) Multiaxial diagnoses; and\n\n(vii) Any other examinations necessary to provide the court with the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection.\n\n(c) Upon completion of the mental health examination, the court shall be provided, as part of the presentence report or other department of health and welfare report to the court, a copy of the mental health assessment along with a summary report. The summary report shall include the following:\n\n(i) Description and nature of the examination;\n\n(ii) Multiaxial diagnoses;\n\n(iii) Description of the defendant’s diagnosis and if the defendant suffers from a serious mental illness (SMI) as that term is now defined, or is hereafter amended, in IDAPA 16.07.33.011, to also include post-traumatic stress disorder;\n\n(iv) An analysis of the degree of impairment due to the defendant’s diagnosis;\n\n(v) Consideration of the risk of danger the defendant may create for the public; and\n\n(vi) If the defendant suffers from a serious mental illness, the report shall also include a plan of treatment that addresses the following:\n\n1. An analysis of the relative risks and benefits of treatment versus nontreatment;\n\n2. Types of treatment appropriate for the defendant; and\n\n3. Beneficial services to be provided.\n\n(d) If the court, after receiving a mental health examination and plan of treatment, determines that additional information is needed regarding the mental condition of the defendant or the risk of danger such condition may create for the public, the court may order additional evaluations and/or recommendations for treatment to be furnished by a psychiatrist, licensed physician or licensed psychologist.\n\n(e) If the court concludes that the defendant suffers from a serious mental illness as defined in paragraph (c)(iii) of this subsection and that treatment is available for such serious mental illness, then the court may order, as a condition of the defendant’s release on bail or on the defendant’s own recognizance or as a condition of probation, that the defendant undergo treatment consistent with the plan of treatment, subject to modification of the plan of treatment by the court. If the plan of treatment is modified in any material term, the department of health and welfare shall notify the court in a timely manner stating the reasons for the modification and informing the court as to the clinical alternatives available to the defendant.\n\n(f) If treatment is ordered, all treatment shall be performed by a provider approved by the department of health and welfare.\n\n(g) Mental health examinations and/or treatment provided or ordered pursuant to this section shall be secured by the department of health and welfare. The department of health and welfare shall exhaust efforts to assist the defendant in gaining access to health care benefits that will cover the defendant’s mental health treatment needs. To the extent that health care benefits are not available to the defendant for the treatment, the expenses for treatment shall be borne by the department of health and welfare. The expenses of all mental health examinations provided or ordered under this section shall be borne by the department of health and welfare. The department of health and welfare shall be entitled to any payment received by the defendant or to which he may be entitled from any public or private source available to the department of health and welfare for the service provided to the defendant. The department of health and welfare shall determine costs pursuant to section 39-3140, Idaho Code. The defendant shall pay the fee for the mental health examinations and treatments consistent with the rules of the department of health and welfare.\n\n(4) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, if the defendant is in treatment for a substance use disorder or mental illness, any substance use disorder assessment required pursuant to subsection (2) of this section or mental health examination required pursuant to subsection (3) of this section need not be performed while the defendant is in such treatment. In such circumstances, the court may make such order as it finds appropriate to facilitate the completion of the sentencing process or other proceeding before the court, including providing for the assessment and treatment records to be included in the presentence investigation report or other report to the court.\n\n(5) Any substance use disorder assessment including any recommended level of care or mental health examination including any plan of treatment shall be delivered to the court, the defendant and the prosecuting attorney prior to any sentencing hearing or probation revocation hearing.\n\n(6) A substance use disorder assessment prepared pursuant to the provisions of this section shall satisfy the requirement of an alcohol evaluation prior to sentencing set forth in section 18-8005(11), Idaho Code, and shall also satisfy the requirement of a substance abuse evaluation prior to sentencing set forth in section 37-2738, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) If the defendant is sentenced to the custody of the board of correction, then any substance use disorder assessment, mental health examination or plan of treatment shall be sent to the department of correction along with the presentence report.\n\n[19-2524, added 2007, ch. 310, sec. 1, p. 875; am. 2012, ch. 225, sec. 2, p. 612; am. 2012, ch. 225, sec. 3, p. 614; am. 2014, ch. 150, sec. 3, p. 415; am. 2020, ch. 82, sec. 12, p. 185; am. 2025, ch. 110, sec. 7, p. 578.]",
