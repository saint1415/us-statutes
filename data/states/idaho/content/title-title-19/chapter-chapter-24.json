But if no evidence appears sufficient to charge him with any offense he must, if in custody, be discharged; or if admitted to bail, his bail is exonerated; or if money has been deposited instead of bail, it must be refunded to the defendant; and the arrest of judgment shall operate as an acquittal of the charge upon which the indictment was founded.\n\n[(19-2411) Cr.
