      "text": "47-310. DEFINITIONS. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in this section shall have the following meanings when used in this act. The use of the plural includes the singular, and the use of the singular includes the plural.\n\n(1) \"Administrator\" means the division administrator for oil and gas conservation within the department of lands, as established under section 58-104A, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) \"American association of professional landmen\" is the land profession’s resource for support, ethical standards of practice, career advancement, and legislative advocacy.\n\n(3) \"American petroleum institute\" or \"API\" is the largest petroleum and natural gas trade organization in America and represents all segments of America’s natural gas and oil industry. API was formed in 1919 as a standards-setting organization and has developed more than seven hundred (700) standards to enhance operational and environmental safety, efficiency, and sustainability.\n\n(4) \"Arms-length contract\" means a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this chapter, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. The following percentages, based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership, determine if persons are affiliated:\n\n(a) Ownership in excess of fifty percent (50%) constitutes control, or as defined in the joint operating agreement.\n\n(b) Ownership of ten percent (10%) through fifty percent (50%) creates a presumption of control.\n\n(c) Ownership of less than ten percent (10%) creates a presumption of noncontrol, which the commission may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arms-length contracts. To be considered arms-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month and must have met the requirements when the contract was executed.\n\n(5) \"Commission\" means the oil and gas conservation commission.\n\n(6) \"Condensate\" means the light liquid hydrocarbons that occur as a gas under initial subsurface conditions that condense into a liquid with a decrease in pressure below the dew point during production in the reservoir and at the surface, or only at the surface. The API gravity of condensate is typically fifty (50) degrees to one hundred twenty (120) degrees.\n\n(7) \"Confidential well status\" refers to a well for which the operator has applied and received confidential status from the commission pursuant to section 47-327, Idaho Code. Information about a confidential well is exempt from disclosure as to the public, but not with regard to the commission or other state authority.\n\n(8) \"Correlative rights\" means the opportunity of each owner in a pool to produce his just and equitable share of oil and gas in a pool without waste.\n\n(9) \"Days\" means calendar days unless otherwise noted.\n\n(10) \"Department\" means the Idaho department of lands.\n\n(11) \"End purchaser\" means a third-party, arms-length purchaser of oil, gas or condensate that is ready for refining or other use or a third-party, arms-length purchaser of other fluid or gaseous hydrocarbons that have been separated in a processing facility.\n\n(12) \"Exploration\" means activities related to the various geological and geophysical methods used to detect and determine the existence and extent of hydrocarbon deposits. The activities related to the search for oil and gas include without limitation aerial, geological and geophysical surveys and studies, seismic work, core drilling and the drilling of test wells.\n\n(13) \"Field\" means the surface area underlaid by one (1) or more pools that are related to a single geological feature.\n\n(14) \"Gas\" means natural gas, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons and varying quantities of non-hydrocarbons that exist either in the gaseous phase or in solution with crude oil in natural underground reservoirs.\n\n(15) \"Gathering facility\" means a facility that receives gathering lines from wells, commingles the produced materials, and then sends those materials to a processing facility.\n\n(16) \"Market value\" means the price at the time of sale, in cash or on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the oil and gas should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus from either party. The costs of marketing, transporting and processing oil and gas produced shall be borne entirely by the producer, and such cost shall not reduce the severance tax directly or indirectly.\n\n(17) \"MCF\" means one thousand cubic feet of gas.\n\n(18) \"Mineral interest\" means the right to explore, drill or produce oil and gas laying beneath the surface of property.\n\n(19) \"Natural gas liquids\" or \"NGL\" means the liquid hydrocarbons that are gaseous in the reservoir, but can be separated out in liquid form at the surface at the pressures and temperatures at which separators normally operate. The liquids consist of varying proportions of butane, propane, pentane and heavier fractions, with little or no methane or ethane. Natural gas liquids can be classified according to their vapor pressures as low (condensate), intermediate (natural gasoline), and high (liquefied petroleum gas).\n\n(20) \"Natural gas plant liquids\" means hydrocarbon compounds in raw gas that are separated as liquids at gas processing plants, fractionating plants, and cycling plants. Natural gas plant liquids obtained include ethane, liquefied petroleum gases (propane and the butanes), and pentanes plus any heavier hydrocarbon compounds. Component products may be fractionated or mixed.\n\n(21) \"Occupied structure\" means a building with walls and a roof within which individuals live or customarily work.\n\n(22) \"Oil\" means and includes crude petroleum oil and other hydrocarbons, regardless of gravity, that are produced at the wellhead in liquid form and the liquid hydrocarbons known as distillate or condensate recovered or extracted from gas.\n\n(23) \"Oil and gas\" means oil or gas or both. Oil and gas refers not only to oil and gas in combination with each other but also generally to oil, gas, casinghead gas, casinghead gasoline, gas-distillate or other hydrocarbons, or any combination or combinations thereof, which may be found in or produced from a common source or supply of oil, oil and gas, or gas-distillate.\n\n(24) \"Oil and gas facility\" means equipment or improvements used or installed at an oil and gas location for the exploration, production, withdrawal, gathering, treatment or processing of oil or natural gas.\n\n(25) \"Oil and gas operations\" means operations to explore for, develop or produce oil and gas.\n\n(26) \"Operator\" means any duly authorized person who is in charge of the development of a lease, pool, or spacing or unitized area, or the operation of a producing well.\n\n(27) \"Owner\" means the person who has the right to drill into and produce from a pool and to appropriate the oil and gas that he produces therefrom, either for himself or for himself and others.\n\n(28) \"Person\" means any natural person, corporation, association, partnership, receiver, trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, fiduciary or other representative of any kind and includes any government or any political subdivision of any agency thereof. The masculine gender, in referring to a person, includes the feminine and the neuter genders.\n\n(29) \"Pool\" means an underground reservoir containing a common accumulation of oil or gas, or both. Each zone of a structure that is completely separated from any other zone in the same structure is a pool.\n\n(30) \"Processing facility\" means a facility that refines gas and liquid hydrocarbons.\n\n(31) \"Producer\" means the owner of a well or wells capable of producing oil and gas.\n\n(32) \"Reservoir\" means a subsurface volume of porous and permeable rock in which oil and gas may have accumulated.\n\n(33) \"Royalty owner\" means any owner of an interest in an oil and gas lease that entitles him to share in the production of the oil and gas under the lease.\n\n(34) \"Tract\" means an expanse of land that:\n\n(a) May be identified by its public land survey system of rectangular surveys that subdivides and describes land in the United States in the public domain and is regulated by the United States department of the interior, bureau of land management;\n\n(b) Is of no particular size;\n\n(c) May be irregular in form;\n\n(d) Is contiguous;\n\n(e) May lay in more than one (1) township or one (1) section;\n\n(f) May have a boundary defined entirely or in part by natural monuments such as streams, divides or straight lines connecting prominent features of topography; and\n\n(g) May be combined with other tracts to form a lease.\n\n(35) \"Uncommitted owner\" means an owner who is not leased or otherwise contractually obligated to the operator.\n\n(36)(a) \"Waste\" as applied to gas shall include the escape, blowing or releasing, directly or indirectly, into the open air of gas from wells productive of gas only, or of gas in an excessive or unreasonable amount from wells producing oil or both oil and gas; and the production of gas in quantities or in such manner as will unreasonably reduce reservoir pressure or unreasonably diminish the quantity of oil and gas that might ultimately be produced; excepting gas that is reasonably necessary in the drilling, completing and testing of wells and in furnishing power for the production of wells.\n\n(b) \"Waste\" as applied to oil means and includes: underground waste; inefficient, excessive or improper use or dissipation of reservoir energy, including gas energy and water drive; surface waste, open-pit storage and waste incident to the production of oil in excess of the producer’s aboveground storage facilities and lease and contractual requirements, but excluding storage (other than open-pit storage) reasonably necessary for building up and maintaining crude stocks and products thereof for consumption, use and sale; and the locating, drilling, equipping, operating or producing of any well in a manner that causes, or tends to cause, reduction of the quantity of oil and gas ultimately recoverable from a pool under prudent and proper operations.\n\n(37) \"Workover\" means an operation in which a well is reentered for the purpose of maintaining or repairing it.\n\n(38) \"Zone\" means a single continuous deposit of oil or gas, or both oil and gas, in the pores of a reservoir.

(1) To prevent or assist in preventing the waste of oil and gas, to avoid drilling unnecessary wells or to protect correlative rights, the department may, on its own motion or on the application of an interested person, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, issue an order establishing spacing units on a statewide basis, or for defined areas within the state, or for oil and gas wells drilled to varying depths.\n\n(2) An order establishing spacing units shall specify the location, size, and shape of the unit, which, in the opinion of the department, shall result in the efficient and economical development of the pool as a whole. These units established by the department shall be geographic. The geographic boundary of the unit shall be described in accordance with the public land survey system. The department shall issue an order establishing a spacing unit or units to determine the area that can be efficiently and economically drained by one (1) well for the orderly development of the pool. The department may amend the order if evidence determines that additional wells are needed to efficiently and economically drain the pool or if evidence indicates the location of the pool is different from that in the initial order. Such amendment is subject to notice and an opportunity for hearing as provided in section 47-328, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) In the absence of an order by the department establishing spacing units, or authorizing different well density patterns for particular pools or parts thereof, the following requirements shall apply:\n\n(a) Oil wells. Every well drilled for oil shall be located in a spacing unit consisting of a forty (40) acre governmental quarter-quarter section or lot or tract, or combination of lots and tracts substantially equivalent thereto.\n\n(i) An oil well located on a forty (40) acre spacing unit shall have a minimum setback of three hundred thirty (330) feet from the completed interval of the wellbore to the closest exterior geographic boundary of the unit.\n\n(ii) No oil well shall be drilled less than nine hundred ninety (990) feet from any other well drilling to and capable of producing oil from the same pool.\n\n(b) Directional and vertical gas wells. Every directional well and vertical well drilled for gas shall be located in a spacing unit consisting of a six hundred forty (640) acre governmental section or lot or tract, or combination of lots and tracts substantially equivalent thereto. A directional or vertical gas well located on a six hundred forty (640) acre spacing unit shall have a minimum setback of six hundred sixty (660) feet from the completed interval of the wellbore to the closest exterior boundaries of the governmental section.\n\n(i) No gas well shall be drilled with the closest point of its completed interval less than nine hundred ninety (990) feet from the closest point of the completion interval of any other well drilling to and capable of producing gas from the same pool; and\n\n(ii) No gas well shall be completed in a known pool unless the closest point of the completion interval is located more than nine hundred ninety (990) feet from the closest point of the completion interval of any other well completed in and capable of producing gas from the same pool.\n\n(c) Horizontal wells. Every horizontal well drilled shall be located in a spacing unit consisting of a six hundred forty (640) acre governmental section or lot or tract, or combination of lots and tracts substantially equivalent thereto. No portion of the completed interval of a horizontal lateral shall be closer than six hundred sixty (660) feet to a vertical plane intersecting with the closest point of a unit boundary or uncommitted tract within a unit. Except for wells in federal exploratory units or in secondary units, the completed interval shall be no closer than one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet to any horizontal well or vertical well completed in the same formation.\n\n(4) An operator may request an amendment in the size, shape or location of a spacing unit under this section. Request may be made for spacing units that are:\n\n(a) Larger or smaller than forty (40) acres for oil;\n\n(b) Larger or smaller than six hundred forty (640) acres for gas; or\n\n(c) Not located within the boundaries of a governmental section, quarter section or quarter-quarter section.\n\n(5) An amendment to spacing units may be authorized upon application, notice and an opportunity for hearing as provided in section 47-328, Idaho Code. To authorize an amendment, the department shall find that such amendment would assist in preventing the waste of oil and gas, avoid drilling of unnecessary wells, or protect correlative rights. In addition to any other notice required by statute or rule, an operator shall provide proper notice and a copy of the application to all uncommitted owners within the proposed unit and to all other parties an operator reasonably believes may be affected. In amending spacing units under this section, the department shall review the spacing unit’s size, shape and location based on the application, any supporting exhibits, and evidence introduced at a hearing.\n\n(6) The department may amend an order that establishes spacing units for a pool to provide for:\n\n(a) An exception to the authorized location of a well;\n\n(b) The inclusion or exclusion of additional areas that overlay the pool as determined by the commission;\n\n(c) The increase or decrease of the size of spacing units; or\n\n(d) The drilling of additional wells within spacing units. A pool may be divided into zones, and a spacing unit for each zone may be established if necessary. The spacing unit within the zone may not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently and economically drained by one (1) or more wells.\n\n(7) Upon the filing of an application to establish a spacing unit, no additional well shall be commenced for production from the pool until the order establishing a spacing unit has been made, unless the commencement of the well is authorized by order of the department.\n\n(8) The department may establish a spacing unit and concurrently authorize the drilling of more than one (1) well in a spacing unit if the department finds that:\n\n(a) Engineering or geologic characteristics justify the drilling of more than one (1) well in that spacing unit; and\n\n(b) The drilling of more than one (1) well in that spacing unit will not result in waste.\n\n[47-317, added 2017, ch. 271, sec. 10, p. 687; am. 2023, ch. 283, sec. 5, p. 852.]",

(1) When two (2) or more separately owned tracts are embraced within a spacing unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or a part of a spacing unit, the interested persons may integrate their tracts or interests for the development and operation of the spacing unit. In the absence of voluntary integration, the department, upon the application of any owner in that proposed spacing unit, shall order integration of all tracts or interests in the spacing unit for drilling of a well or wells, for development and operation thereof and for the sharing of production therefrom. The department, as a part of the order establishing a spacing unit, may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the royalty interests in the unit shall, in the absence of voluntary agreement, be deemed to be integrated without the necessity of a subsequent separate order integrating the royalty interests. Each such integration order shall be upon the just and reasonable terms and conditions set forth in this section.\n\n(2) All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well upon any portion of a spacing unit for which an integration order has been entered, shall be deemed for all purposes the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the spacing unit by the several owners thereof. That portion of the production allocated to a separately owned tract included in a spacing unit shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such separately owned tract by a well drilled thereon.\n\n(3) Each such integration order shall authorize the drilling, equipping and operation, or operation, of a well or wells on the spacing unit; shall designate an operator for the integrated unit; shall prescribe the time and manner in which all the owners in the spacing unit may elect to participate therein; and shall make provision for the payment by all those who elect to participate therein of the reasonable actual cost thereof, plus a reasonable charge for supervision and interest. Each such integration order shall provide for the three (3) following options:\n\n(a) Working interest owner. An owner who elects to participate as a working interest owner shall pay the proportionate share of the actual costs of drilling and operating a well allocated to the owner’s interest in the spacing unit. Working interest owners who share in the costs of drilling and operating the well are entitled to their respective shares of the production of the well. The operator of the integrated spacing unit and working interest owners shall enter into an approved joint operating agreement. The department shall deem the joint operating agreement as just and reasonable if the agreement is based on a standard industry form, such as those supplied by the American association of professional landmen, and if the operator demonstrates to the department that any amendments to the standard form are not prejudicial to working interest owners.\n\n(b) Nonconsenting working interest owner. An owner who refuses to share in the risk and actual costs of drilling and operating the well, but desires to participate as a working interest owner, is a nonconsenting working interest owner. The operator of the integrated spacing unit shall be entitled to recover a risk penalty of up to three hundred percent (300%) of the nonconsenting working interest owner’s share of the cost of drilling and operating the well under the terms set forth in the integration order. After all the costs have been recovered by the consenting owners in the spacing unit, the nonconsenting owner is entitled to his respective shares of the production of the well and shall be liable for his pro rata share of costs as if the nonconsenting owner had originally agreed to pay the costs of drilling and operating the well. The operator of the integrated spacing unit and nonconsenting working interest owners shall enter into a joint operating agreement. The department shall deem the joint operating agreement as just and reasonable if the agreement is based on a standard industry form, such as those supplied by the American association of professional landmen, and if the operator demonstrates to the department that any amendments to the standard form are not prejudicial to nonconsenting working interest owners.\n\n(c) Base entitlement. If an owner fails to make an election within the election period set forth in the integration order, the operator shall compensate such owner for the owner’s share of production with the following just and reasonable terms, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent the operator and owners from voluntarily agreeing to different lease terms before or after the entry of an integration order:\n\n(i) Such owner shall receive a minimum one-eighth (1/8) royalty of any gas, oil, or natural gas liquids produced, proportionate to the owner’s interest in the integrated unit.\n\n(ii) Royalty payments shall comply with the terms of section 47-331, Idaho Code.\n\n(iii) The operator of an integrated spacing unit shall pay such owner the highest bonus payment per acre that the operator paid to another owner in the spacing unit prior to the filing of the integration application.\n\n(iv) The operator shall avoid, to the maximum extent possible, any use of surface lands belonging to owners integrated under this subsection. Where such use cannot be reasonably avoided, use of surface lands, and compensation for such use, shall be governed by section 47-334, Idaho Code.\n\n(v) The operator shall comply with the requirements of sections 47-319, 47-332, 47-333, and 47-334, Idaho Code.\n\n(vi) An integration order including the terms specified in this subsection fulfills the department’s obligation to integrate mineral interests upon just and reasonable terms.\n\n(4) An application for an order integrating the tracts or interests in a spacing unit shall substantially contain and be limited to only the following:\n\n(a) The applicant’s name and address;\n\n(b) A description of the spacing unit to be integrated;\n\n(c) A geologic statement concerning the likely presence of hydrocarbons;\n\n(d) A statement that the proposed drill site is leased;\n\n(e) A statement of the proposed operations for the spacing unit, including the name and address of the proposed operator;\n\n(f) A proposed joint operating agreement;\n\n(g) A list of all uncommitted owners in the spacing unit to be integrated under the application, including names and addresses;\n\n(h) An affidavit indicating that at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the mineral interest acres in the spacing unit support the integration application by leasing or participating as a working interest owner;\n\n(i) An affidavit stating the highest bonus payment paid to a leased owner in the spacing unit being integrated prior to filing the integration application; and\n\n(j) A resume of efforts documenting the applicant’s good faith efforts on at least two (2) separate occasions within a period of time no less than sixty (60) days to inform uncommitted owners of the applicant’s intention to develop the mineral resources in the proposed spacing unit and desire to reach an agreement with uncommitted owners in the proposed spacing unit. Provided however, if any owner requests no further contact from the applicant, the applicant will be relieved of further obligation to attempt contact to reach agreement with that owner. At least one (1) contact must be by certified U.S. mail sent to an owner’s last known address. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, the applicant must publish a legal notice of its intention to develop and request that the owner contact the applicant in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the proposed spacing unit is located. The resume of efforts should indicate the applicant has made reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with all uncommitted owners in the proposed spacing unit. Reasonable efforts are met by complying with this subsection.\n\n(5) At the time the integration application is filed with the department, the applicant shall certify that, for uncommitted owners who are unknown or cannot be found, a notice of the application was published in a newspaper in the county where the proposed spacing unit is located. Each published notice shall include notice to the affected uncommitted owner of the opportunity to respond to the application and the deadline by which a response must be filed with the department.\n\n(6) An operator who has not been able to obtain consent from sixty-seven percent (67%) of the mineral interest acres in the spacing unit may nevertheless apply for an integration order under this section if all of the conditions set forth in this subsection have been met. The department shall issue an integration order, which shall affect only the unit area described in the application, if it finds that the operator has met all of the following conditions:\n\n(a) The operator has obtained consent from at least fifty-five percent (55%) of mineral interest acres;\n\n(b) The operator has negotiated diligently and in good faith for a period of at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to his application for an integration order; and\n\n(c) The uncommitted owners in the affected unit shall receive from the operator mineral lease terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the lessee than those set forth in section 47-331(2), Idaho Code.\n\n(7) An application for integration shall be subject to the procedures set forth in section 47-328, Idaho Code.\n\n(8) An integration order shall be in effect for a term of five (5) years and as long thereafter as oil and gas operations are being conducted by the operator, unless extended by the department upon application of the operator. Any application to amend or extend an integration order shall comply with the notice requirements of section 47-328(3)(b), Idaho Code. For purposes of such notice, all parties receiving the base entitlement set forth in subsection (3)(c) of this section shall be considered uncommitted owners.\n\n(9) The entry of an integration order does not inhibit the right of mineral interest owners to pursue claims against the operator for damages to person, property, or water rights.\n\n[(47-320) 47-322, added 1963, ch. 148, sec. 8, p. 433; am. 2016, ch. 48, sec. 5, p. 135; am. 2017, ch. 121, sec. 2, p. 281; am. and redesig. 2017, ch. 271, sec. 13, p. 690; am. 2023, ch. 283, sec. 7, p. 855.]",

The department may approve exclusions from the unit area as reasonably necessary to prevent waste or to protect correlative rights. An order adding to or excluding from a unit area must be upon just and reasonable terms, which shall be determined by the application of the terms set forth in section 47-320(3), Idaho Code.\n\n(a) An order that amends a plan of unit operations and adds an area to a previously established unit shall not become effective until: the amended plan of unit operations has been signed and approved in writing by the owners who will be required to pay at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the costs of the unit operation in the area to be added; the amended plan has been signed and approved in writing by the working interest owners of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the production of the unit operations; and the department has made a finding in the order that the plan for unit operations has been so approved.\n\n(b) An order providing for an exclusion from a unit area may not become effective until: an amended plan of unit operations excluding an area from the unit has been approved in writing by the owners in the original unit area who are required to pay at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the costs of unit operations; the amended plan has been approved in writing by the working interest owners in the original unit area required to pay at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the production of the unit operations; and the department has made a finding in the order that the plan for unit operations has been so approved.\n\n(12) Operations, including the commencement, drilling or operation of a well upon a portion of a unit area, are deemed conducted on each separately owned tract in the unit area by the owner or owners thereof. That portion of a unit’s production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area, when produced, is deemed produced from a well drilled on that tract. Operations conducted under an order of the department providing for a unit operation shall constitute fulfillment of expressed or implied obligations of a lease or contract covering lands within the unit area to the extent that compliance with those obligations is not possible without a further order of the department.\n\n(13) That portion of unit production allocated to a tract and the proceeds of sale for that portion are deemed the property and income of the several persons to whom or to whose credit that portion is allocated or payable under the order providing for unit operation.\n\n(14) A division order or other contract relating to a sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract or combination of tracts remains in force and applies to oil and gas allocated to the tract until terminated in accordance with provisions of the order providing for unit operation or in accordance with the terms of such division order or other contract.\n\n(15) Except to the extent that all affected parties agree, an order providing for unit operation does not result in a transfer of all or part of a person’s title to the oil and gas rights in a tract in the unit area.\n\n(16) Except to the extent that all affected parties agree, all property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired in the conduct of a unit operation hereunder is deemed acquired for the account of the owners within the unit area and is deemed the property of the owners in the proportion that the expenses of the unit operation are charged.\n\n(17) The formation of a unit and the operation of the unit under an order of the department shall not be in violation of any statute of this state relating to trusts, monopolies, contracts or combinations in the restraint of trade.\n\n[(47-321) 47-323, added 1963, ch. 148, sec. 9, p. 433; am. 2015, ch. 66, sec. 1, p. 176; am. 2016, ch. 48, sec. 6, p. 137; am. and redesig. 2017, ch. 271, sec. 14, p. 693; am. 2023, ch. 283, sec. 8, p. 858.]",

(1) For the purposes of paying the expenses of administration of this act and for the privilege of extracting oil and gas in this state, there is hereby levied and imposed on all oil and gas produced, saved and sold or transported from the premises in Idaho where produced a tax of two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the gross income received by the producer of the oil and gas produced. \"Gross income\" shall mean the amount realized by the producer for sale of the oil and gas, whether the sale occurs at the wellhead or after transportation of the product, without deduction for marketing, transportation, manufacturing, and processing costs borne by the producer. Where the parties to the sale are related parties and the sales price is lower than the price for which that oil and gas could otherwise have been sold to a ready, willing, and able buyer and where the taxpayer was legally able to sell the oil and gas to such a buyer, gross income shall be determined by reference to comparable arms-length sales of like kind, quality, and quantity in the same field or area. For purposes of this subsection, \"related parties\" shall be as defined in section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code, as defined, in section 63-3004, Idaho Code. This tax is in addition to all other taxes provided by law. It shall be the duty of the state tax commission to enforce collection of this tax and to make such rules as may be necessary, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. All money so collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the oil and gas conservation fund, which fund is hereby created in the office of the state treasurer of the state of Idaho.\n\n(2) The persons owning an interest, working interest, royalty interest, payments out of production, or any other interest in the oil and gas, or in the proceeds thereof, shall be liable for such tax in proportion to their ownership at the time of production. The tax so assessed and fixed shall be payable monthly, and the sum so due shall be remitted to the state tax commission, on or before the twentieth of the month following the month in which the tax accrued, by the producer on behalf of himself and all other interested persons. The person remitting the tax, as herein provided, is hereby empowered and required to deduct from any amounts due the persons owning an interest in the oil and gas, or in the proceeds thereof, at the time of production a proportionate amount of such tax before making payment to such persons.\n\n(3) The tax imposed by this section shall apply to all lands in the state of Idaho, anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding; provided however, there shall be exempted from the tax hereinabove levied and assessed the following, to wit:\n\n(a) The interest of the United States of America and the interest of the state of Idaho and the political subdivisions thereof in any oil and gas or in the proceeds thereof.\n\n(b) The interest of any Indian or Indian tribe in any oil and gas or the proceeds thereof, produced from lands subject to the supervision of the United States.\n\n(c) Oil and gas used in producing operations or for repressuring or recycling purposes.\n\n(4) To the extent that such sections are not in conflict with the provisions of this act, the deficiency in tax and notice of deficiency as well as the collection and enforcement procedures provided by the Idaho income tax act, sections 63-3038, 63-3039, 63-3040, 63-3042 through 63-3065A, 63-3068, 63-3071 and 63-3075 through 63-3078, Idaho Code, shall apply and be available to the state tax commission for enforcement of the provisions of this act and the assessment and collection of any amounts due. Said sections shall for this purpose be considered a part of this act and wherever liens or any other proceedings are defined as income tax liens or proceedings they shall, when applied in enforcement or collection pursuant to this act, be described as an oil and gas tax lien or proceeding.\n\nThe state tax commission may be made a party defendant in an action at law or in equity by any person aggrieved by the unlawful seizure or sale of his property, or in any suit for refund or to recover an overpayment, but only the state of Idaho shall be responsible for any final judgment secured against the state tax commission, and said judgment or any other amount erroneously or illegally collected shall be paid or satisfied out of the state refund account created by section 63-3067, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) All moneys collected under this chapter shall be distributed by the state tax commission as follows:\n\n(a) An amount of money shall be distributed to the state refund account sufficient to pay current refund claims. All refunds authorized under this chapter by the state tax commission shall be paid through the state refund account, and those moneys are continuously appropriated.\n\n(b) For the balance of the proceeds, forty percent (40%) shall be distributed by the end of the month following each monthly due date by the state tax commission into any oil and gas revenue share account as follows:\n\n(i) Forty-four percent (44%) is hereby appropriated and shall be paid to the current expense fund of the county from which the oil and gas was produced, to be used to mitigate the impacts associated with oil and gas production, development and transportation in that county;\n\n(ii) Twenty-eight percent (28%) is hereby appropriated and shall be paid to the cities within the county from which the oil and gas was produced. Such funds shall be distributed to each city based upon the proportion that the city’s population bears to the total population of all of the cities within the county; and\n\n(iii) Twenty-eight percent (28%) is hereby appropriated and shall be paid to the public school income fund.\n\n(c) The remainder of the moneys deposited into the oil and gas conservation fund, sixty percent (60%) of the proceeds after refunds, may be expended pursuant to legislative appropriation and shall be used for defraying the expenses of the oil and gas conservation commission in carrying out the provisions of this act. At the beginning of each fiscal year, those moneys in the oil and gas conservation fund, after applicable refunds and distribution as noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, that exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the current year’s appropriations for the oil and gas conservation commission shall be transferred to the general fund. The oil and gas conservation commission shall audit all bills for salaries and expenses incurred in the enforcement of this act that may be payable from the oil and gas conservation fund that shall be audited, allowed and paid as to the claims against the state.\n\n[47-330, added 1963, ch. 148, sec. 17, p. 433; am. 2012, ch. 79, sec. 1, p. 228; am. 2013, ch. 187, sec. 7, p. 453; am. 2015, ch. 274, sec. 1, p. 1129; am. 2017, ch. 271, sec. 23, p. 702; am. 2018, ch. 169, sec. 14, p. 363.]",
