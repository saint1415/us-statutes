(1) Location for exploration purposes may be made upon lands belonging to the state of Idaho in which the mineral rights are reserved or belong to the state, including the beds of all navigable rivers in the state of Idaho and all portions of said navigable rivers between the natural or ordinary high water marks, providing that no exploration location may be made on any lands for which a mineral lease application has been made and is pending as provided in section 47-704, Idaho Code; providing further, that no exploration location may be made for salable minerals as that term is used in section 47-701, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) Such locations when made upon surveyed land shall conform to legal subdivisions. When made upon the beds of navigable rivers, they shall not exceed one-half (1/2) river mile. When made on surveyed land, they shall not exceed twenty (20) acres except that when made upon surveyed land designated as a lot, they may equal one-half (1/2) of said lot. Descriptions of locations made on the beds of navigable rivers, the boundaries of which shall have been meandered, shall be described as near as may be with the lotting of the fractional subdivisions bordering upon the navigable rivers, and the description of the location shall be so accurately drawn and tied to the government corners that the ground may be accurately located and so described that the location may be accurately platted upon the books of the state board of land commissioners.\n\n(3) The discoverer of a mineral deposit or a person desiring to prospect for mineral shall immediately post conspicuously on each twenty (20) acre tract or fraction thereof, or each one-half (1/2) river mile that he desires to locate, an exploration certificate of location declaring that he has made such discovery or declaring that he desires to prospect for mineral, together with the date of such discovery or declaration. Said certificate shall be in such form as the board may prescribe. The locator shall be allowed twenty (20) days from such date to file an exact copy of exploration certificate of location with the state board of land commissioners and pay the appropriate fees. Said certificate shall designate the legal subdivisions located and shall be recorded in the office of said board as of the date of filing, and an entry of such location shall be made upon the plat and tract books.\n\n(4) The locator shall be entitled to hold said location for a period of two (2) years from the first of the month following the date of recording and by performing one hundred dollars ($100) worth of work during each year for each location.\n\n(5) Work within the meaning of this chapter shall consist of tunnels, shafts, or other mining excavations or development, including drilling by conventional methods and pits or shafts sunk to determine the value of the gravels. Work shall include roads, trails, buildings, machinery, or other surface improvement. All such work may be done at one (1) place on the location or at as many places as the locator may desire, and in case two (2) or more locations are under the same ownership, then said work may be performed on any one (1) or more locations. Work so performed as annual assessment, where performed for the benefit of a group contiguous and under common ownership, shall be such that it shall be of material benefit to each and every location forming the contiguous group.\n\n(6) Written proof that such work has been done shall be filed with the state board of land commissioners on such forms and in such manner as it shall prescribe. Such procedure shall empower the locator to retain possession of and prospect said location for a period of two (2) years, at the end of which time he shall be required to take a lease upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the state board of land commissioners.

      "text": "47-703A. EXPLORATION ON STATE LANDS — BOND. (1) With the exception of casual exploration as defined in subsection (6)(a) of this section, prior to motorized exploration on state lands, an operator shall first submit to the director of the department of lands, an exploration and reclamation plan and a bond in such form as prescribed by the board. The bond shall be in an amount determined by the board to be the estimated reasonable costs to perform the reclamation activities described in the exploration and reclamation plan in the event of the failure of the operator to complete those activities, plus ten percent (10%) of such costs, and conditioned on the payment of all damages to the land and resources thereon caused by the motorized exploration. An operator shall also comply with the dredge and placer mining act, chapter 13, title 47, Idaho Code, and the surface mining act, chapter 15, title 47, Idaho Code, where applicable. Written approval by the board is required prior to entry for motorized exploration.\n\n(2) Except as provided in this subsection, no bond for exploration reclamation submitted pursuant to this chapter shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for any given acre of affected land. The board may require a bond in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for any given acre of affected land only when the following conditions have been met:\n\n(a) The board has determined that such bond is necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter;\n\n(b) The board has delivered to the operator, in writing, a notice setting forth the reasons it believes such bond is necessary; and\n\n(c) The board has conducted a hearing where the operator is allowed to give testimony to the board concerning the amount of the proposed bond. The hearing shall be held under such rules as promulgated by the board. This requirement for hearing may be waived, in writing, by the operator. Any hearing that is held shall, at the discretion of the director, extend the time up to thirty (30) days in which the board must act on a submitted plan.\n\n(3) Weather permitting, the board shall deliver to the operator within sixty (60) days after the receipt of any exploration and reclamation plan a notice of rejection or notice of approval of said plan, as the case may be; provided, however, that if the board fails to deliver a notice of approval or notice of rejection within said time period, the plan submitted shall be deemed approved under subsection (1) of this section, and the operator may, upon furnishing a bond to the board that meets the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, commence and conduct his motorized exploration on the lands covered by such plan as if a notice of approval of said plan had been received from the board; provided, however, that if weather conditions prevent the board from inspecting the lands to obtain information needed to approve or reject a submitted plan, it may, in writing to the operator, extend the time not to exceed thirty (30) days after weather conditions permit such inspection. Any notice of rejection issued by the director of the department of lands or his properly authorized designated officer may be appealed by the operator to the board.\n\n(4) The operator shall reclaim the surface damaged by the motorized exploration to the approximate previous contour and condition insofar as is reasonably possible.\n\n(5) When all reclamation activities described in the exploration and reclamation plan have been completed, the operator shall notify the board. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice, weather permitting, the board shall notify the operator as to whether or not the reclamation activities have been satisfactorily completed. Upon the determination by the board that the reclamation activities in question have been satisfactorily completed, the board shall release the bond. If weather conditions prevent the board from obtaining information needed to determine if the reclamation activities have been satisfactorily completed, it may, in writing to the operator, extend the time not to exceed thirty (30) days after weather conditions permit such inspection. Any notice issued by the director of the department of lands or his properly authorized designated officer to not release the bond may be appealed by the operator to the board.\n\n(6) The following definitions shall apply to this chapter:\n\n(a) \"Casual exploration\" means entry and/or exploration which does not appreciably disturb or damage the land or resources thereon. Casual exploration includes, but is not limited to, geochemical and/or geophysical exploration techniques, sampling with hand tools, and entry using wheeled vehicles for transportation to conduct such exploration. Exploration using suction dredges having an intake diameter of two (2) inches or less shall be considered casual exploration when operated on endowment lands in a perennial stream. Exploration using suction dredges having an intake diameter of five (5) inches or less shall be considered casual exploration when operated in a navigable river. All suction dredging on state lands must follow the requirements of the stream protection act, chapter 38, title 42, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) \"Motorized exploration\" means exploration which may appreciably disturb or damage the land or resources thereon. Motorized exploration includes, but is not limited to, drilling, trenching, dredging, or other techniques which employ the use of earth moving or other motorized equipment, seismic operations using explosives, and sampling with suction dredges having an intake diameter greater than two (2) inches when operated on endowment land in a perennial stream, and sampling with suction dredges having an intake diameter greater than five (5) inches when operated in a navigable river. When operated in an intermittent stream, suction dredges shall be considered motorized exploration regardless of the intake size.\n\n(c) \"Exploration and reclamation plan\" means, for this section only, a written plan and maps with sufficient detail to accurately describe all of the activities associated with motorized exploration on state lands and the activities associated with reclamation. Reclamation activities may include, but are not limited to, regrading to resemble the original contour, plugging drill holes and revegetation. An estimate of third party reclamation costs, acceptable to the board, shall be included in the plan and will be used to determine the bond amount.\n\n[47-703A, added 1981, ch. 325, sec. 4, p. 679; am. 1990, ch. 317, sec. 1, p. 865; am. 2014, ch. 57, sec. 1, p. 135.]",

(1) The state board of land commissioners may lease in tracts of sizes as the board may deem fair for prospecting, exploration, and mining of mineral deposits, except for leases for oil, gas and other hydrocarbons that may be contained in any portion of the unsold lands of the state or that may be contained in state lands sold with a reservation of mineral deposits or that belong to the state of Idaho by reason of being situate between the high water marks of navigable rivers of the state, for such annual rental, not less than one dollar ($1.00) per acre per annum, and for such royalty upon the product as the board may deem fair and in the interest of the state, except in the case of state oil and gas leases wherein the royalty to the state shall be not less than twelve and one-half percent (12 1/2%), and provided that the minimum royalty shall not be less than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) and not more than market conditions.\n\n(2) All mineral leases, except leases for oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons, and geothermal resources of state school lands and for lands belonging to the state of Idaho, shall be for a term of up to twenty (20) years and shall be continued if any of the following provisions are met:\n\n(a) Precious metals, minerals, mineral concentrates, mineral products, or ores are produced in paying quantities;\n\n(b) The lessee has negotiated and remitted a prepaid royalty no less than five dollars ($5.00) per acre per year;\n\n(c) The lessee in good faith conducts exploration, prospecting, work, or mining operations thereon;\n\n(d) The mineral lease is undergoing a regulatory approval process for exploration, prospecting, or mining; or\n\n(e) The lessee conducts work on land adjacent or near the leased premises as a single mining operation, including construction of infrastructure associated with mining.\n\n(3) Provided, that the leaseholder of any mineral lease except leases for oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons, and geothermal resources heretofore or hereafter issued, upon the expiration of the initial lease and all renewals thereof, shall be given the preferential right to renew such lease or renewal leases under such readjustment of the terms and conditions as the board may determine to be necessary in the interest of the state.\n\n(4) All applications received, whether by mail or by personal delivery over the counter, shall be immediately stamped with the date and hour of filing. Simultaneous filings result when two (2) or more applications are received for the same lands during the same hour of the same day. Simultaneous filings shall be resolved by competitive bidding. This provision does not apply to applications received from an applicant having a preferential right under this section. In the absence of a simultaneous filing, and except for lands and resources which may be designated for competitive bidding, right of priority to a mineral lease shall be determined by the first qualified applicant who shall file a completed, signed application on the form of the department of lands or exact copy thereof between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. during any business day, together with the application fee set by the board.\n\n(5) Applications for mineral leases shall be made under oath in such form as the board may prescribe, and the applicant shall describe the land, specify the particular mineral or minerals, and give such additional information as may be required by the rules and regulations of the board. If the applicant for a lease has previously filed a certificate of location, as provided in section 47-703, Idaho Code, upon any part of the land desired to be leased, such application shall be given a preferential right to the land covered by his location; that no lands upon which a mineral location has been duly made and recorded as provided in section 47-703, Idaho Code, shall be leased for mining purposes during the two (2) year periods to any applicant except the person having made such location; provided, however, that no locations may be made for oil and gas deposits or lands or for geothermal resources.\n\n(6) Any motorized exploration as defined in section 47-703, Idaho Code, on the lands between the ordinary high water marks of any navigable river of the state shall be prohibited except upon written approval by the board and submission of a bond to the department in the form and amount set by the board; and, if applicable, an operator shall also comply with the Idaho dredge and placer mining protection act, chapter 13, title 47, Idaho Code; provided, that in all instances an operator shall comply with the stream protection act and all other applicable laws and rules of the state.\n\n(7) Upon receipt by the state board of land commissioners of an application to lease any lands which may belong to the state of Idaho by reason of being situate between the high water marks of navigable rivers of the state, the board shall cause, at the expense of the applicant, a notice of such application to be published once a week for two (2) issues in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which said lands described in said application are situated. The board or its authorized representative shall hold a public hearing on the application, if requested in writing, no later than thirty (30) days after the last published notice by ten (10) persons whose lawful rights to use the waters applied for may be injured thereby, or by an association presenting a petition with signatures of not less than ten (10) such aggrieved parties; provided that the board may order a public hearing in the first instance. The board shall consider fully all written and oral submissions respecting the application.\n\n(8) Provided, however, that the state board of land commissioners shall send notice of any such application for leasing the bed of navigable rivers to the director of the department of water resources, who, if the director thinks advisable, shall at the expense of the applicant make an investigation. If said investigation shows that the rights of interested parties may be jeopardized by the issuance of the proposed lease, the director shall give notice of such applications to parties affected thereby. If it shall appear to the state board of land commissioners that the leasing of any lands between the high water marks of any navigable river will be injurious to the rights of any person or persons having the right to the use of the waters thereof, for irrigation, power, or any other lawful purpose, the state board of land commissioners shall deny such application.\n\n(9) Mineral leases granted according to this section, including but not limited to leases that have been awarded but not executed, shall comply with the following terms and conditions:\n\n(a) After granting of a lease, no fees or payments shall be charged to lessees except for royalty payments, including prepaid and production, and rent per acre per annum.\n\n(b) Rent per acre per annum may be indexed for inflation, but no more than three percent (3%) per annum. The rental paid shall be deducted from the royalties as they accrue for the life of the lease.\n\n(c) No more than one (1) lease may be issued for the same mineral on the same land.\n\n(d) Only one (1) lessee may hold multiple mineral leases on the same land.\n\n(e) In the event of an exchange or sale involving leased lands, the purchaser shall accept and be assigned to perform the exact terms and conditions set forth in the lease as the lessor.\n\n(f) The leaseholder demonstrates a mineral resource is present on the public lands using industry standard to estimate or project a mineral resource that is likely viable for future mineral development. The board shall recognize its role as a partner on behalf of state lands and provide confidentiality to the leaseholders regarding resource estimates that may be reported. If the leaseholder determines in the future to drop any mineral lease, the board may use this information for public consumption to encourage and support mineral development on those leases.\n\n(g) No less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration date of the mineral lease, lease terms and conditions shall be fairly modified and readjusted if needed. If an agreement cannot be reached, the lessor and lessee shall engage in good faith mediation. The lease shall remain in full force and effect during the mediation.\n\n[(47-704) added 1923, ch. 96, sec. 6, p. 115; am. 1925, ch. 220, sec. 3, p. 404; am. 1937, ch. 124, sec. 2, p. 185; am. 1939, ch. 99, sec. 1, p. 166; am. 1949, ch. 77, sec. 1, p. 135; am. 1951, ch. 43, sec. 1, p. 52; am. 1957, ch. 201, sec. 1, p. 416; am. 1957, ch. 210, sec. 1, p. 439; am. 1967, ch. 225, sec. 1, p. 676; am. 1980, ch. 31, sec. 1, p. 54; am. 1981, ch. 325, sec. 5, p. 679; am. 1986, ch. 81, sec. 3, p. 240; am. 1990, ch. 316, sec. 2, p. 863; am. 1990, ch. 317, sec. 2, p. 866; am. 2020, ch. 341, sec. 2, p. 999; am. 2021, ch. 321, sec. 34, p. 975.]",

If at the trial the violation is established, the court shall enter a decree perpetually enjoining said defendant, his agents, employees, contractors and assigns from thereafter committing said or similar violations.\n\n(b) Proceed by legal action in the name of the state of Idaho to obtain an order requiring the operator to promptly repair the damage and reclaim the state lands in accordance with the requirements of section 47-703A, Idaho Code, and rules adopted pursuant thereto. If thereafter the court finds that the operator is not promptly complying with such order, the court shall order the operator to immediately pay an amount determined by the department to be the anticipated cost of reasonable repair and reclamation in accordance with section 47-703A(4), Idaho Code, and rules adopted pursuant thereto.\n\n(c) Proceed to forfeit the operator’s bond required by section 47-703A(1), 47-704(6) or 47-708, Idaho Code. The board may cause to have issued and served upon the operator alleged to be committing such violation, a formal complaint which includes a statement of the manner in and the extent to which said operator is alleged to be violating the provisions of this act. Such complaint may be served by certified mail, and return receipt signed by the lessee, an officer of a corporate lessee, or the designated agent of the lessee shall constitute service.
