Such leases for public purposes may be entered into by negotiation and shall secure a rental amount based on the fair market value of the state land.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all state endowment trust lands may be leased for a period of up to thirty-five (35) years for residential purposes as determined by the state board of land commissioners including, but not limited to, single family, recreational cottage site and homesite leases.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all state lands may be leased for a period of up to forty (40) years for grazing leases.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all state endowment trust lands may be leased for a period of up to forty-nine (49) years for commercial purposes under such terms and conditions as may be set by the board, provided that, for such leases in excess of twenty (20) years, the board consults with the county commissioners of the county in which the lands are located before leasing the lands, and the use for which the land is leased shall be consistent with the local planning and zoning ordinances insofar as is reasonable and practicable. For each lease in excess of twenty (20) years, the department shall hold a hearing in the county in which the parcel is located. Grazing leases shall be excluded from the hearing requirement.\n\n(6) The term \"commercial purposes\" means fuel cells, low impact hydro, wind, geothermal resources, biomass, cogeneration, sun or landfill gas as the principal source of power with a facility capable of generating not less than twenty-five (25) kilowatts of electricity, industrial enterprises, retail sales outlets, business and professional office buildings, hospitality enterprises, commercial recreational activities, multifamily residential developments and other similar businesses. For purposes of this section, farming leases, grazing leases, conservation leases including lands enrolled in federal conservation programs such as the conservation reserve enhancement program (CREP), noncommercial recreation leases, oil and gas leases, mineral leases, communication site leases, single family, recreational cottage site and homesite leases, and leases for other similar uses, are not considered leases for commercial purposes.

Such applications will be considered by the state land board and be disposed of in the manner provided by law; except that the board may reject conflicting applications for a lease for commercial purposes if the lessee exercises the preference right to renew clause, and provided such right is specified in the lease.\n\n(10) Where conflicts appear upon leases, except for mineral leases which, pursuant to chapter 7, title 47, Idaho Code, contain a preferential right to renew clause, such applications shall be considered as having been filed simultaneously. However, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the state board of land commissioners from accepting and considering applications for new leases at any time.\n\n(11) In case improvements have been made on land while under lease which is expiring, and the former lessee is not the successful bidder, but the land is leased to another, the amount of such improvements shall be paid to the former lessee. The following shall be considered improvements: plowing done within one (1) year, provided no crop has been raised on the plowed land after such plowing, fencing, buildings, cisterns, wells, growing crops and any other asset which shall be considered an improvement by the director.\n\n(12) Commercial leases of the state lands shall not be subject to the conflict auction provisions of section 58-310, Idaho Code. The board may, at its discretion, consider individual applications or call for proposals and sealed bids by public advertisement, and may evaluate said proposals and award the lease to the bidder whose proposal achieves the highest return over the term of the lease and who is capable of meeting such terms and conditions as may be set by the board; in the alternative, the board may call for lease applications by public advertisement and if more than one (1) person files an application to hold an auction in the same manner as provided in section 58-310, Idaho Code. In all cases, the board must obtain a reasonable rental, based upon fair market value of the state land, throughout the duration of the lease. The board may reject any or all proposals and any or all bids, and may reoffer the lease at a later date if the board determines that the proposals or bids do not achieve the highest and best use of the land at market rental.\n\n[58-307, added 1905, p. 131, 15; reen.

The state board of land commissioners may at any time direct the sale of any state lands, in such parcels as they shall deem for the best interests of the state. All sales of state lands shall be advertised in four (4) consecutive issues of some weekly newspaper in the county in which the land is situated, if there be such paper, if not, then in some newspaper published in an adjoining county, and in such other paper or papers as the board may direct. The advertisement shall state the time, place and terms of sale, a description of the land and value of the improvements, if any, thereon, and the minimum price per acre of each parcel as fixed by the board, below which no bid shall be received: provided, that sales of state lands shall only be made to citizens of the United States and to those who shall have declared their intentions to become such. If the required sum be not paid forthwith by the highest bidder any lands upon which such payment shall not be made may be immediately reoffered at public sale as before. If any land be sold on which surface improvements have been made by a lessee, or by a former purchaser whose certificate of purchase has for any reason been canceled, said improvements shall be appraised under the direction of the state board of land commissioners. When lands on which improvements have been made, as above, are sold, the purchaser, if other than the owner or former owner of said improvements, shall pay the appraised value of said improvements to the owner thereof, or to the former purchaser who placed the same thereon, taking a receipt therefor, and shall deposit such receipt with the state board of land commissioners before he shall be entitled to a certificate of purchase or patent of said land: provided, the lessee or former owner is not indebted to the state for delinquent rentals or instalment payments on said land. If he is indebted to the state, the value of the improvements shall be credited on his indebtedness and the surplus, if any, be paid to him. All such receipts shall be filed and preserved in the office of said board: provided, that no school lands shall be sold for less than their appraised value nor for less than ten dollars ($10.00) per acre; provided, further, that in the case of the sale of land leased as grazing land and which is too rough, rocky or steep to be reclassified as farming land, the lessee, if he is not the successful bidder, shall be entitled to continue in possession under the lease for a period of two (2) years from the first day of December next occurring after the date of sale at public auction of said land or until expiration of the lease, whichever period shall be shorter. During such period, all rental earned shall belong to the purchaser subject to the following provisions:\n\n(1) If the land is sold upon instalment contract to the purchaser, the lessee shall continue to make rental payments to the director of the department of lands and the amount of rental earned after the date of sale shall, when received, be applied against and reduce the principal or interest, or both, payable by the purchaser;\n\n(2) If the purchaser pays the purchase price in full, all rentals earned after the date of sale shall be paid directly to the purchaser.

If any purchaser of state land after receiving a certificate of purchase, as provided in this chapter, shall fail to make any of the payments stipulated therein, and the same remains unpaid for thirty (30) days after the time when it should have been paid as specified in such certificate, the director of the department of lands shall, by certified letter addressed to such delinquent purchaser at his last known post-office address, notify such purchaser of such delinquency and of the amount due, and that unless such amount be paid within sixty (60) days after the date of mailing such letter and notice, the board will declare all rights of the purchaser in and to said land forfeited and the certificate and contract relating thereto annulled.\n\nAfter the expiration of said period of sixty (60) days, the state board of land commissioners shall declare such forfeiture, and shall annul said contract and certificate. Such action of the board shall be recorded in the minutes of the proceedings of the board. When such forfeiture shall have been declared and entered in the minutes, as hereinbefore provided, all rights of such purchaser in and to said lands shall be and are extinguished and the state board of land commissioners may sell the land again: provided, that unless other disposition has meanwhile been made of the land, said state board of land commissioners may, upon application of the former purchaser, if such application is made within two (2) years after the certificate has been canceled, reinstate any such canceled certificate upon compliance by the purchaser with such conditions as the board may impose. Such conditions to be imposed by the board shall include the funding of delinquent instalments of principal and interest accrued to the date of reinstatement, by distributing the same in annual payments, to commence with the expiration of the original period covered by the contract of sale, or any extension or extensions thereof, such deferred payments to draw interest from the date of the reinstatement of the certificate; but the board may, in its discretion, impose other conditions, and may, in its discretion, require the payment of such delinquencies in cash at the time of reinstatement. On reinstatement being made the board may, in its discretion, give credit to the purchaser, as for interest paid on his contract, of any amounts which may have been paid by the purchaser as rent of the land during the period of the cancellation of his certificate.

The said sum so deferred shall draw interest the same as if it were originally a part of the purchase price named in the sale certificate from the date of the supplemental certificate herein referred to until paid. The forms, terms and conditions of such supplemental agreement, and the form of the application therefor, shall be as prescribed by the board. Any such supplemental agreement as herein provided, and any agreement reinstating a canceled certificate, as herein provided, shall be deemed a part of the original sale certificate.\n\n[(58-316) 1905, p. 131, sec. 21; reen.

Such disposition may be by negotiated sale or exchange; provided however, that such negotiated sales, transfers or exchanges shall be for adequate and valuable consideration.\n\n(a) In the event of such contemplated sale, transfer or exchange the state board of land commissioners shall cause to be published a notice of such contemplated sale, transfer or exchange, setting out in full the description of the property concerned, both as to what is being offered and what is to be received, and the proposed use of the property by the tax-supported unit which proposes to acquire such property.\n\n(b) Such notice shall be published in a newspaper published in the county in which the property is situate for four (4) consecutive weeks prior to a certain fixed date therein, designating a time and place for public hearing in the matter.\n\n(c) The state board of land commissioners shall determine at the next regularly scheduled meeting subsequent to such hearing as to acceptance or rejection of such proposed sale, transfer or exchange, and if accepted, the tax-supported unit shall thereafter have sixty (60) days in which to accept or reject the proffer, following such decision.\n\n(d) If such negotiations fail, then the property may be subject to public sale as set forth in this section.\n\n(3) If no tax-supported agency or unit of the state of Idaho or the United States acquires the surplus property, the state board of land commissioners may offer at public sale, after notice of publication for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county in which the property is situate, and sell the same to the highest and best bidder upon terms and conditions to be determined by the board and specified in the notice of sale. If the property does not sell at public auction, the board may have the property appraised and enter into negotiations with any party(s) to effect disposition of the property for adequate and valuable consideration. Sale may be by any method that will help dispose of the property including, but not limited to, direct negotiations with interested parties, use of advertising, hiring real estate agents and public auction.\n\n(4) In all cases, the compensation received by the board for the sale of surplus property shall be returned to the agency which declared the property surplus to be placed in such account as may be appropriate. The board may deduct the costs of the sale from any proceeds before transmitting the proceeds back to the agency which declared the property surplus.\n\n[58-332, added 1951, ch. 223, sec. 2, p. 452; am. 1971, ch. 48, sec. 1, p. 104; am. 1986, ch. 113, sec. 1, p. 305; am. 2000, ch. 305, sec. 2, p. 1041.]",
