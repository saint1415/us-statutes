A wage claim dismissed for lack of prosecution may be refiled with the department subject to the limitation periods provided in section 45-614, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) The determinations and revised determinations shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law and contain provisions advising the claimant and employer of their rights to appeal the determination within fourteen (14) days from the date of mailing or the date of electronic transmission in a manner approved by the department.\n\n(7) The timely filing of an appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. The determination or revised determination shall become a final determination unless an appeal is filed by the claimant or the employer in accordance with this chapter and the department’s rules within fourteen (14) days after notice provided pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. Provided, however, if a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, because of delay or error by the United States postal service or because of error on the part of the department, a determination or revised determination was not delivered to the party’s last known address or transmitted electronically in a manner approved by the department within fourteen (14) days of the date of mailing or service indicated on the determination or revised determination, the period for filing a timely appeal to the department or the commission extends to fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of notice. If an appeal is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a determination or revised determination shall become immediately due and payable to the department and may be enforced by the department in accordance with section 45-618, Idaho Code.\n\n(8) The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service of notice of determinations and revised determinations. Notice shall be deemed served if delivered to the person being served, if mailed to the person’s last known address, or if electronically transmitted to the claimant at the claimant’s request and with the department’s approval. Service by electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date notice is electronically transmitted. The date indicated on determinations or revised determinations as the date of service or date of mailing shall be presumed to be the date of service unless otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent evidence.\n\n(9) An appeal from a wage claim determination or revised determination shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or the appellant’s representative and shall contain words that, by fair interpretation, request the appeal process for a specific determination of the department. The appeal may be filed by personal delivery, by mail, by electronic transmission, or by fax to the wage and hour section of the department at the address indicated on the wage claim determination. The date of personal delivery shall be noted on the appeal and shall be deemed the date of filing. If mailed, the appeal shall be deemed to be filed on the date of mailing as determined by the postmark. A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on the date received by the wage and hour section. A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal received by the wage and hour section on a weekend or holiday shall be deemed filed on the next business day.\n\n(10) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, the director shall appoint appeals examiners who have been specifically trained to hear wage claims. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals examiner shall affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination involved, after affording the claimant and the employer reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or may refer a matter back to the compliance or hearing officer for further action. The appeals examiner shall notify the claimant and the employer of his decision by serving notice in the same manner as provided in subsection (8) of this section. The decision shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. The appeals examiner may, upon application for rehearing by the claimant, the employer, or on his own motion, rehear, affirm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided, that such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed wage claim. All testimony at any hearing shall be recorded. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be allowed fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If the claimant or the employer formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a witness whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly issue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable. Unless the claimant or the employer, within fourteen (14) days after service of the decision of the appeals examiner, seeks judicial review pursuant to section 45-619, Idaho Code, or unless an application or motion is made for a rehearing of such decision, the decision of the appeals examiner shall become final and the amount awarded by the decision shall become immediately due and payable to the department. A decision that has become final may be enforced by the department according to section 45-618, Idaho Code.\n\n(11) No person acting on behalf of the director shall participate in any case in which he has a direct or indirect personal interest.\n\n(12)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or necessarily involved in a determination or decision of the appeals examiner that has become final, shall be conclusive for all the purposes of this chapter as between the claimant and the employer who had notice of such determination or decision. Subject to judicial review as set forth in this chapter, any determination or decision shall be conclusive for all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collateral attack irrespective of notice.\n\n(b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a determination or decision rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner, a court, or any other person authorized to make such determinations shall have preclusive effect in any other action or proceeding, except proceedings that are brought:\n\n(i) Pursuant to this chapter;\n\n(ii) To collect wage claims; or\n\n(iii) To challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this chapter or administrative proceedings under this chapter.\n\n[45-617, added 1999, ch. 51, sec. 20, p. 123; am. 2021, ch. 66, sec. 1, p. 204; am. 2025, ch. 29, sec. 1, p. 101.]",

(1) A department determination, if not appealed to an appeals examiner; or a decision of the appeals examiner, if judicial review is not sought; or a court order following judicial review, may be enforced by the department according to section 45-620, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) If at any time the department determines, in its sole discretion, that a wage claim upon which a lien was filed pursuant to section 45-620, Idaho Code, is no longer collectable, the department shall:\n\n(a) Transfer the state lien from the central lien filing system of the secretary of state to the district court in the county of the debtor’s last known address. A lien transferred pursuant to this subsection shall be entered in the judgment docket of the district court and recorded as a transferred lien with the effective date of the lien being the date it was initially filed with the secretary of state.\n\n(b) Notify the claimant in writing, at the claimant’s last known address, that the lien has been transferred and advise the claimant that no further action will be maintained by the department on the wage claim, and that from the date of the transfer, it shall be the claimant’s sole responsibility to maintain and enforce the lien.\n\n(3) A lien transferred pursuant to this section shall be enforceable by the claimant in the same manner and with the same effect as if the lien had been a judgment of the district court.\n\n[45-618, added 1999, ch. 51, sec. 21, p. 125.]",

It may be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same force and effect as a levy and sale pursuant to a writ of execution. Upon the completion of his services pursuant to said warrant, the sheriff or deputy shall receive the same fees and expenses as are provided by law for services related to a writ of execution.
