After a notice of transition has been filed, the effectiveness of the notice of state lien shall lapse on the fifth anniversary of the date of the recording with the county recorder, unless the filing agency files a notice of continuation as required by section 45-1906(4), Idaho Code.\n\n(c) A notice of state lien which is first filed during the transition period shall be fully effective during the transition period only if the filing agency has filed a notice with the secretary of state and recorded a notice with the appropriate county recorder. A notice of state lien which is filed with the secretary of state during the transition period, and which is not recorded with the county recorder, shall be fully effective on and after July 1, 1998, and shall be effective before that date against any party with actual notice after the date of filing.
