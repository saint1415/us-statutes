As used in this act:\n\n(1) \"Beneficiary\" means the person named or otherwise designated in a trust deed as the person for whose benefit a trust deed is given, or his successor in interest, and who shall not be the trustee.\n\n(2) \"Grantor\" means the person conveying real property by a trust deed as security for the performance of an obligation.\n\n(3) \"Trust deed\" means a deed executed in conformity with this act and conveying real property to a trustee in trust to secure the performance of an obligation of the grantor or other person named in the deed to a beneficiary.\n\n(4) \"Trustee\" means a person to whom title to real property is conveyed by trust deed, or his successor in interest for the limited purpose of the power of sale contained in this chapter upon the occurrence of certain contingencies set forth in such trust deed, and the obligation to reconvey the deed of trust pursuant to section 45-1514, Idaho Code. All other incidents of ownership of such real property shall remain with the grantor. For the purpose of section 45-1506(2)(c), Idaho Code, a trustee is not a party requiring notice of sale.\n\n(5) \"Real property\" means any right, title, interest and claim in and to real property owned by the grantor at the date of execution of the deed of trust or acquired thereafter by said grantor or his successors in interest. Provided, nevertheless, real property as so defined which may be transferred in trust under this act shall be limited to: (a) any real property located within an incorporated city or village at the time of the transfer; (b) any real property not exceeding eighty (80) acres, regardless of its location, provided that such real property is not principally used for the agricultural production of crops, livestock, dairy or aquatic goods; or (c) any real property not exceeding forty (40) acres regardless of its use or location.\n\n(6) The trustee shall be entitled to a reasonable charge for duties or services performed pursuant to the trust deed and this chapter, including compensation for reconveyance services notwithstanding any provision of a deed of trust prohibiting payment of a reconveyance fee by the grantor or beneficiary, or any provision of a deed of trust which limits or otherwise restricts the amount of a reconveyance fee to be charged and collected by the trustee. A trustee shall be entitled to refuse to reconvey a deed of trust until the trustee’s reconveyance fees and recording costs for recording the reconveyance instruments are paid in full. The trustee shall not be entitled to a foreclosure fee in the event of judicial foreclosure or work done prior to the recording of a notice of default. If the default is cured prior to the time of the last newspaper publication of the notice of sale, the trustee shall be paid a reasonable fee.\n\n[45-1502, added 1957, ch. 181, sec. 2, p. 345; am. 1967, ch. 118, sec. 2, p. 251; am. 1970, ch. 42, sec. 1, p. 89; am. 1983, ch. 190, sec. 1, p. 515; am. 1995, ch. 326, sec. 2, p. 1095; am. 1996, ch. 248, sec. 1, p. 783; am. 1997, ch. 387, sec. 1, p. 1242; am. 2008, ch. 365, sec. 1, p. 1000; am. 2016, ch. 227, sec. 1, p. 624.]",

(1) Transfers in trust of any estate in real property as defined in section 45-1502(5), Idaho Code, may hereafter be made to secure the performance of an obligation of the grantor or any other person named in the deed to a beneficiary. Where any transfer in trust of any estate in real property is hereafter made to secure the performance of such an obligation, a power of sale is hereby conferred upon the trustee to be exercised after a breach of the obligation for which such transfer is security, and a deed of trust executed in conformity with this act may be foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner hereinafter provided, or, at the option of beneficiary, by foreclosure as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. If any obligation secured by a trust deed is breached, the beneficiary may not institute a judicial action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce an obligation owed by the grantor or his successor in interest unless:\n\n(a) The trust deed has been foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner provided in this chapter and the judicial action is brought pursuant to section 45-1512, Idaho Code; or\n\n(b) The action is one for foreclosure as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or\n\n(c) The beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless as defined in subsection (2) of this section, in which case the beneficiary may bring an action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce the obligation owed by grantor or his successor in interest without first resorting to the security; or\n\n(d) The action is one excluded from the meaning of \"action\" under the provisions of section 6-101(3), Idaho Code.\n\n(2) As used in this section, \"substantially valueless\" means that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed has become valueless through no fault of the beneficiary, or that the beneficiary’s interest in such property has little or no practical value to the beneficiary after taking into account factors such as the nature and extent of the estate in real property which was transferred in trust; the existence of senior liens against the property; the cost to the beneficiary of satisfying or making current payments on senior liens; the time and expense of marketing the property covered by the deed of trust; the existence of liabilities in connection with the property for clean up of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants; and such other factors as the court may deem relevant in determining the practical value to the beneficiary of the beneficiary’s interest in the real property covered by the trust deed.\n\n(3) The beneficiary may bring an action to enforce an obligation owed by grantor or his successor in interest alleging that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless without affecting the priority of the lien of the trust deed and without waiving his right to require the trust deed to be foreclosed by advertisement and sale and the beneficiary may, but shall not be required to, plead an alternative claim for foreclosure of the trust deed as a mortgage in the same action. If the court finds that the property is not substantially valueless, the beneficiary may seek judicial foreclosure of the trust deed, or he may dismiss the action and foreclose the trust deed by advertisement and sale in the manner provided in this chapter. If the court finds that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless and enters a judgment upon the obligation, when that judgment becomes final the beneficiary shall execute a written request to the trustee to reconvey to the grantor or his successor in interest the estate in real property described in the trust deed. If the beneficiary obtains judgment on an obligation secured by a trust deed pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section, the lien of the judgment shall not relate back to the date of the lien of the trust deed.\n\n[45-1503, added 1957, ch. 181, sec. 3, p. 345; am. 1967, ch. 118, sec. 3, p. 251; am. 1989, ch. 340, sec. 1, p. 861; am. 1993, ch. 281, sec. 2, p. 951.]",

The trustee may foreclose a trust deed by advertisement and sale under this act if:\n\n(1) The trust deed, any assignments of the trust deed by the trustee or the beneficiary and any appointment of a successor trustee are recorded in mortgage records in the counties in which the property described in the deed is situated; and\n\n(2) There is a default by the grantor or other person owing an obligation the performance of which is secured by the trust deed or by their successors in interest with respect to any provision in the deed which authorizes sale in the event of default of such provision; and\n\n(3) The trustee or beneficiary shall have (a) filed for record in the office of the recorder in each county wherein the trust property, or some part or parcel, is situated, a notice of default identifying the deed of trust by stating the name or names of the trustor or trustors and giving the book and page where the same is recorded, or a description of the trust property, and containing a statement that a breach of the obligation for which the transfer in trust is security has occurred, and setting forth the nature of such breach and his election to sell or cause to be sold such property to satisfy such obligation; and (b) mailed a copy of such notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to any person requesting such notice of record as provided in section 45-1511, Idaho Code. Service by mail in accordance with this subsection (3) shall be deemed effective at the time of mailing. In addition, the trustee shall mail the notice required in this section to any individual who owns an interest in property which is the subject of this section. Such notice shall be accompanied by and affixed to the following notice in twelve (12) point boldface type, on a separate sheet of paper, no smaller than eight and one-half (8 1/2) inches by eleven (11) inches:\n\n\"NOTICE REQUIRED BY IDAHO LAW\n\nMortgage foreclosure is a legal proceeding where a lender terminates a borrower’s interest in property to satisfy unpaid debt secured by the property. This can mean that when a homeowner gets behind on his or her mortgage payments, the lender forces a sale of the home on which the mortgage loan is based. Some individuals or businesses may say they can \"save\" your home from foreclosure. You should be cautious about such claims. It is important that you understand all the terms of a plan to \"rescue\" you from mortgage foreclosure and how it will affect you. It may result in your losing valuable equity that you may have in your home. If possible, you should consult with an attorney or financial professional to find out what other options you may have. Do not delay seeking advice, because the longer you wait, the fewer options you may have. Under Idaho law, you have five (5) days to rescind or undo certain contracts or agreements that relate to transferring interests in property or money in a foreclosure situation. An attorney or financial professional can tell you more about this option.\".\n\nIf the trust deed, or any assignments of the trust deed, are in the Spanish language, the written notice set forth in this section shall be in the Spanish language on a form to be prepared and made available by the office of the attorney general.\n\n(4) No action, suit or proceeding has been instituted to recover the debt then remaining secured by the trust deed, or any part thereof, or if such action or proceeding has been instituted, the action or proceeding has been dismissed.\n\n[45-1505, added 1957, ch. 181, sec. 5, p. 345; am. 1990, ch. 401, sec. 1, p. 1123; am. 2008, ch. 192, sec. 2, p. 603; am. 2009, ch. 136, sec. 1, p. 417.]",

At the time of each such attempt, a copy of the notice of sale shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the real property unless the copy of the notice of sale previously posted remains conspicuously posted. Provided, however, that if during such an attempt personal service is made upon an adult occupant and a copy of the notice is posted, then no further attempt at personal service and no further posting shall be required.

The trustee may postpone the sale of the property upon request of the beneficiary by publicly announcing at the time and place originally fixed for the sale the postponement to a stated subsequent date and hour. No sale may be postponed to a date more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date from which the sale is postponed. A postponed sale may itself be postponed in the same manner and within the same time limitations as provided in this subsection. For any loan made by a state or federally regulated beneficiary, which loan is secured by a deed of trust encumbering the borrower’s primary residence as determined pursuant to section 45-1506C(1), Idaho Code, the trustee, prior to conducting any trustee’s sale previously postponed pursuant to this section, shall mail notice of such trustee sale at least fourteen (14) days prior to conducting such sale by the same means and to the same persons as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The trustee or beneficiary shall, prior to conducting the trustee’s sale, record an affidavit of mailing confirming that such notice has been mailed as required by this section.
