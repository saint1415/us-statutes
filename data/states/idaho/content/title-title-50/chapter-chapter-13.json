(1) If the interior monuments for a subdivision are to be set on or before a specified date after the recording of the plat of the subdivision, the person subdividing the land described in the plat shall furnish, prior to recording the plat, to the governing body of the city or county which approved the plat, either a bond or cash deposit, at the option of the governing body, in an amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the estimated cost of performing the work for the interior monumentation. The estimated cost of performing such work will be determined by the professional land surveyor signing the plat.\n\n(2) If the person subdividing the land described in subsection (1) of this section pays the professional land surveyor for performing the interior monumentation work and notifies the governing body of such payment, the governing body, within two (2) months after such notice, shall release the bond or return the cash deposit upon a finding that such payment has been made.

In the event the professional land surveyor signing the plat performed his services pursuant to a contract between the person subdividing the land and a business entity possessing a certificate of authorization, as required in this chapter, and the professional land surveyor is unable, refuses or fails to set the interior monuments for a subdivision, a substitute professional land surveyor employed by the same business entity may assume responsible charge for the remainder of the project and set the monuments, as provided in this chapter, and the governing body shall not direct the county surveyor or contract with a professional land surveyor in private practice to set such monuments.\n\n(4) In the event any interior monument cannot be placed at the location shown on the plat, the professional land surveyor shall place a witness corner or reference point and he shall file a record of survey as provided in chapter 19, title 55, Idaho Code, to show the location of any witness corner or reference point in relation to the platted location of the corner. In the event the professional land surveyor signing the plat does not set the interior monuments for a subdivision, the substitute professional land surveyor shall file a record of survey as provided in chapter 19, title 55, Idaho Code, to show which monuments were set by which professional land surveyor.\n\n[50-1332, added 1987, ch. 227, sec. 1, p. 482; am. 1997, ch. 190, sec. 11, p. 525; am. 1998, ch. 220, sec. 5, p. 757; am. 2011, ch. 136, sec. 9, p. 388; am. 2012, ch. 25, sec. 1, p. 82.]",
