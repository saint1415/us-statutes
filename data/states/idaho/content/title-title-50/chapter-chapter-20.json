It is hereby found and declared that there exist in municipalities of the state deteriorated and deteriorating areas (as herein defined) which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of these conditions is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of its revenue because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization and other forms of public protection, services and facilities.\n\nIt is further found and declared that certain of such areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this act, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this act, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that salvageable areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.\n\nIt is further found and declared that the powers conferred by this act are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended as herein provided and the power of eminent domain and police power exercised; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions herein enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n[50-2002, added 1965, ch. 246, sec. 2, p. 600.]",

URBAN RENEWAL AGENCY — AUTHORIZATION — DISSOLUTION.\n\n(1)(a) There is hereby created in each municipality an independent public body corporate and politic to be known as the \"urban renewal agency\" that was created by resolution as provided in section 50-2005, Idaho Code, before July 1, 2011, for the municipality; provided, that such agency shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in section 50-2005, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) An urban renewal agency created after July 1, 2011, shall not transact any business or exercise its powers provided for in this chapter until a majority of qualified electors, voting in a citywide or countywide election, depending on the municipality in which such agency is created, vote to authorize such agency to transact business and exercise its powers provided for in this chapter. If prior to July 1, 2011, the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subsection, then such agency shall transact business and shall exercise its powers hereunder and is not subject to the requirements of this paragraph.\n\n(2) Upon satisfaction of the requirements under subsection (1) of this section, the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact the business and exercise the powers hereunder by a board of commissioners to be established as follows:\n\n(a) Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commissioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided that the original term of office of no more than two (2) commissioners shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.\n\n(b) For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a commissioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall be filled by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.\n\n(c) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may appoint and designate, from among its members, members of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, provided that such representation shall be less than a majority of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after July 1, 2017, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban renewal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended.\n\n(d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may terminate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and designate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency for not more than one (1) calendar year.\n\n(e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may provide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban renewal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply to elected commissioners, and the county election law shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if the person were running for county commissioner. In the event of a vacancy in an elected commissioner position, the replacement shall be appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.\n\n(3) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal agency is located or is doing business.\n\n(4) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.\n\n(5)(a) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.\n\n(b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own counsel and legal staff.\n\n(c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or before March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year, which report shall include the financial data and audit reports required under sections 67-1075 and 67-1076, Idaho Code. The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed with the municipality and the state controller and that the report is available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times on the website of the state controller.\n\n(d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a municipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a municipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the agency.\n\n(6) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.\n\n(7) A local governing body that has created an urban renewal agency may dissolve the urban renewal agency by the enactment of an ordinance as provided in this subsection. Before such local governing body may dissolve an urban renewal agency, it shall adopt a resolution of intent to dissolve the urban renewal agency, which resolution shall be transmitted to the urban renewal agency. Upon the adoption of the resolution of intent to dissolve, the urban renewal agency shall no longer have any authority to initiate any new urban renewal projects or to take on any additional financial obligations other than such obligations as are necessary to wind down its affairs. The local governing body and the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall then participate in a joint meeting to discuss dissolution. If following the joint meeting the local governing body of an authorized municipality makes a finding that there no longer exists a need for the urban renewal agency in the municipality, the local governing body shall provide, by ordinance, for a dissolution of the agency. The ordinance shall be effective upon publication. The ordinance shall be recorded in the real property records of the county in which the agency operated. The local governing body shall transmit a copy of the recorded dissolution ordinance to the urban renewal agency, the county clerk, and the state tax commission within ten (10) business days of the recording date. Upon dissolution of the urban renewal agency, title to all property of the urban renewal agency shall revert to the municipality.\n\n[50-2006, added 1965, ch. 246, sec. 6, p. 600; am. 1976, ch. 256, sec. 1, p. 871; am. 1986, ch. 9, sec. 1, p. 50; am. 1987, ch. 276, sec. 1, p. 568; am. 2002, ch. 143, sec. 1, p. 394; am. 2005, ch. 213, sec. 21, p. 656; am. 2011, ch. 317, sec. 1, p. 911; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 132, p. 477; am. 2016, ch. 349, sec. 1, p. 1014; am. 2019, ch. 288, sec. 24, p. 845; am. 2021, ch. 87, sec. 2, p. 292; am. 2021, ch. 89, sec. 17, p. 310; am. 2022, ch. 111, sec. 28, p. 386; am. 2025, ch. 300, sec. 1, p. 1253.]",

(a) An urban renewal project for an urban renewal area shall not be planned or initiated unless the local governing body has, by resolution, determined such area to be a deteriorated area or a deteriorating area or a combination thereof and designated such area as appropriate for an urban renewal project.\n\n(b) An urban renewal agency may itself prepare or cause to be prepared an urban renewal plan, or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to an urban renewal agency. Prior to its approval of an urban renewal project, the local governing body shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the municipality, if any, for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the municipality as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to the local governing body within sixty (60) days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission, or if no recommendations are received within said sixty (60) days, then without such recommendations, the local governing body may proceed with the hearing on the proposed urban renewal project prescribed by subsection (c) hereof.\n\n(c) The local governing body shall hold a public hearing on an urban renewal project, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the municipality.

(a) An urban renewal agency may sell, lease, or otherwise transfer real property or any interest therein acquired by it for an urban renewal project, and may enter into contracts with respect thereto, in an urban renewal area for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, educational or other uses or for public use, or may retain such property or interest for public use, in accordance with the urban renewal plan, subject to such covenants, conditions and restrictions, including covenants running with the land, as it may deem to be necessary or desirable to assist in preventing the development or spread of future slums or blighted areas or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this act: Provided, that such sale, lease, other transfer, or retention, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after the approval of the urban renewal plan by the local governing body. The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns shall be obligated to devote such real property only to the uses specified in the urban renewal plan, and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the urban renewal agency may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on such real property required by the urban renewal plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan except property disposed of by it to the community or any other public body which property must be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of section 50-2015, Idaho Code, even though such fair value may be less than the cost of acquiring and preparing the property for redevelopment. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, an urban renewal agency shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the urban renewal agency retaining the property; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. The urban renewal agency in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that such purchaser or lessee shall be without power to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the urban renewal agency until he has completed the construction of any or all improvements which he has obligated himself to construct thereon. Real property acquired by an urban renewal agency which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred, shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan. Any contract for such transfer and the urban renewal plan (or such part or parts of such contract or plan as the urban renewal agency may determine) may be recorded in the land records of the county in such manner as to afford actual or constructive notice thereof.\n\n(b) An urban renewal agency may dispose of real property in an urban renewal area to private persons only under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures as it shall prescribe or as hereinafter provided in this subsection. An urban renewal agency may, by public notice by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community (thirty (30) days prior to the execution of any contract to sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property and prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance with respect thereto under the provisions of this section) invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate an urban renewal area, or any part thereof. Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that proposals shall be made by those interested within thirty (30) days after the date of publication of said notice, and that such further information as is available may be obtained at such office as shall be designated in said notice. The urban renewal agency shall consider all such redevelopment of rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out, and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease or other transfer of any real property acquired by the agency in the urban renewal area. The urban renewal agency may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this act. The agency may execute such contract in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) and deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such contract.\n\n(c) An urban renewal agency may temporarily operate and maintain real property acquired by it in an urban renewal area for or in connection with an urban renewal project pending the disposition of the property as authorized in this act, without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) above, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the urban renewal plan.\n\n(d) Any real property acquired pursuant to section 50-2007(d) may be disposed of without regard to other provisions of this section if the local governing body has consented to the disposal.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, and notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, land in an urban renewal project area designated under the urban renewal plan for industrial or commercial uses may be disposed of to any public body or nonprofit corporation for subsequent disposition as promptly as practicable by the public body or corporation for redevelopment in accordance with the urban renewal plan, and only the purchaser from or lessee of the public body or corporation, and their assignees, shall be required to assume the obligation of beginning the building of improvements within a reasonable time. Any disposition of land to a nonprofit corporation under this subsection shall be made at its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan. Any disposition of land to a public body under this subsection shall be made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of section 50-2015, Idaho Code.\n\n(f) Property previously acquired or acquired by an agency for rehabilitation and resale shall be offered for disposition within three (3) years after completion of rehabilitation, or an annual report shall be published by the agency in a newspaper of general circulation published in the community listing any rehabilitated property held by the agency in excess of such three (3) year period, stating the reasons such property remains unsold and indicating plans for its disposition.\n\n[50-2011, added 1965, ch. 246, sec. 11, p. 600; am. 1985, ch. 183, sec. 1, p. 468; am. 1987, ch. 259, sec. 2, p. 538.]",

Bonds issued under the provisions of this act are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempted from all taxes.\n\n(c) Bonds issued under this section shall be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the urban renewal agency and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, be payable upon demand or mature at such time, or times, bear interest at a rate or rates, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form either with or without coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of repayment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium), be secured in such manner, and have such other characteristics, as may be provided by such resolution or ordinance, or trust indenture or mortgage issued pursuant thereto.\n\n(d) Such bonds may be sold at not less than par at public or private sales held after notice published prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in such other medium of publication as the agency may determine or may be exchanged for other bonds on the basis of par: Provided, that such bonds may be sold to the federal government at private sale at not less than par, and, in the event less than all of the authorized principal amount on such bonds is sold to the federal government, the balance may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the agency of not to exceed the interest cost to the agency of the portion of the bonds sold to the federal government.\n\n(e) In case any of the officials of the urban renewal agency whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this act shall cease to be such officials before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officials had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this act shall be fully negotiable.\n\n(f) In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond issued under this act or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the agency in connection with an urban renewal project, as herein defined, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this act.\n\n[50-2012, added 1965, ch. 246, sec. 12, p. 600; am. 1970, ch. 133, sec. 17, p. 309; am. 1972, ch. 156, sec. 2, p. 344.]",

No plan amendment shall be interpreted to or shall cause an extension of the limitations established for the existing revenue allocation area as set forth in section 50-2904, Idaho Code. Subject to the limitations in this section and section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, an urban renewal plan that includes a revenue allocation area may be extended only one (1) time to extend the boundary of the revenue allocation so long as the total area to be added is not greater than ten percent (10%) of the existing revenue allocation area and the area to be added is contiguous to the existing revenue allocation area but such contiguity cannot be established solely by a shoestring or strip of land which comprises a railroad or public right-of-way.\n\n[50-2033, added 2011, ch. 317, sec. 5, p. 918; am. 2016, ch. 349, sec. 2, p. 1016.]",
