No municipality may give or lend any money or property in aid of a public corporation chartered under the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that a municipality may accept grants from the United States government or any agency thereof and apply grants in connection with industrial development facilities. The municipality that creates a public corporation shall annually review any financial statements of the public corporation and at all times shall have access to the books and records of the public corporation. No public corporation may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and the county or city within whose planning jurisdiction the proposed industrial development facility lies. No revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to this chapter unless the issuer makes a finding that in its opinion the interest paid on the bonds will be exempt from income taxation by the federal government. Revenue bonds issued by a corporation under this chapter shall not be considered to constitute a debt of the state, of the municipality or of any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision or agency of this state or to pledge any or all of the faith and credit of any of these entities. The revenue bonds shall be payable solely from both the revenues derived as a result of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds, including, without limitation, amounts received under the terms of any financing document or by reason of any additional security furnished by the user of the industrial development facility in connection with the financing thereof, any money and other property received from private sources. Each revenue bond shall contain on its face statements to the effect that:\n\n(a) Neither the state, the municipality or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision or agency of the state is obligated to pay the principal or the interest thereon;\n\n(b) No tax funds or governmental revenue may be used to pay the principal or interest thereon; and\n\n(c) Neither any or all of the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state, the municipality or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision or agency thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the revenue bond.\n\nA public corporation may incur only those financial obligations which will be paid from revenues received pursuant to financing documents, from fees or charges paid by users or prospective users of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds or from the proceeds of revenue bonds. A public corporation established under the terms of this chapter constitutes an authority and an instrumentality of the municipality which creates it (within the meaning of those terms in the regulations of the United States treasury and the rulings of the Internal Revenue Services prescribed pursuant to section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended) and may act on behalf of the municipality under whose auspices it is created for the specific public purposes authorized by this chapter. The public corporation is not a municipal corporation within the meaning of the state constitution and the laws of the state or a political subdivision within the meaning of the state constitution and the laws of the state, including without limitation article VIII, section 4, of the Idaho constitution. A municipality shall not delegate to a public corporation any of the municipality’s attributes of sovereignty, including, without limitation, the power to tax, the power of eminent domain and the police power.\n\n[50-2706, added 1982, ch. 119, sec. 1, p. 329.]",

Issuance of revenue bonds for facilities pursuant to this chapter shall not preclude the issuance of additional revenue bonds in connection with the same facility. Any subsequent bond issue shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issue of revenue bonds.\n\n(f) As security for the payment of the principal of and interest on any revenue bonds, issued, and any agreements made in connection therewith, to mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber any or all of its industrial development facilities or any part or parts thereof, whether then owned or thereafter acquired, and to assign any mortgage and repledge any security conveyed to the public corporation, to secure any loan made by the public corporation and to pledge the revenues and receipts therefrom;\n\n(g) To sue and be sued, complain and defend in its corporate name;\n\n(h) To make contracts and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying out of its business;\n\n(i) To have a corporate seal and to use the same by causing it, or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner produced;\n\n(j) Subject to the limitations of section 50-2706, Idaho Code, to borrow money, accept grants from, or contract with any local, state or federal governmental agency or with any financial, public or private corporation;\n\n(k) To make and alter bylaws not inconsistent with this chapter for the administration and regulation of the affairs of the corporation;\n\n(l) To collect fees or charges from users or prospective users of industrial development facilities to recover actual or anticipated administrative costs;\n\n(m) To expend surplus fees or charges collected from users or prospective users of industrial development facilities for construction of public facilities including, but not limited to, sidewalks, landscaping, water and sewer systems, roads, extension of utility services and roads, but such expenditures shall be limited to projects which are within the limits and purposes of this chapter; and to conduct or contract for studies to determine features needed by local governments to foster economic development;\n\n(n) To execute financing documents incidental to the powers enumerated in this section.\n\n(2) No public corporation created under this chapter may operate any industrial development facility as a business other than as lessor, seller or lender. The purchase and holding of mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests and contracting for any servicing thereof is not considered the operation of an industrial development facility.\n\n(3) No public corporation may exercise any of the powers authorized in this section or issue any revenue bonds with respect to any industrial development facility unless the industrial development facility is located wholly within the boundaries of the municipality under whose auspices the public corporation is created. In cases involving proposed energy or solid waste disposal facilities which may be located partially or wholly outside the boundaries of the creating municipality, no public corporation may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and planning and zoning approval by the county or city within whose planning jurisdiction the proposed industrial development facility lies.\n\n[50-2708, added 1982, ch. 119, sec. 1, p. 330; am. 1986, ch. 29, sec. 1, p. 82.]",

If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any revenue bonds or coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the revenue bonds, such signature shall for all purposes have the same effect as if he had remained in office until delivery.

A public corporation may sell revenue bonds at a public or private sale for such price and bearing interest at such fixed or variable rates as may be determined by the board of directors and with the consent of the user.
