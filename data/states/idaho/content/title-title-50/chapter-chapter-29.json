It is hereby found and declared that there exists in municipalities a need to raise revenue to finance the economic growth and development of urban renewal areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas. The purpose of this act is to provide for the allocation of a portion of the property taxes levied against taxable property located in a revenue allocation area for a limited period of time to assist in the financing of urban renewal plans, to encourage private development in urban renewal areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas, to prevent or arrest the decay of urban areas due to the inability of existing financing methods to promote needed public improvements, to encourage taxing districts to cooperate in the allocation of future tax revenues arising in urban areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas in order to facilitate the long-term growth of their common tax base, and to encourage private investment within urban areas and competitively disadvantaged border community areas. The foregoing purposes are hereby declared to be valid public purposes for municipalities.\n\n[50-2902, added 1988, ch. 210, sec. 2, p. 393; am. 1990, ch. 430, sec. 3, p. 1190; am. 1994, ch. 381, sec. 1, p. 1223.]",

The following terms used in this chapter shall have the following meanings, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n(1) \"Act\" or \"this act\" means this revenue allocation act.\n\n(2) \"Agency\" or \"urban renewal agency\" means a public body created pursuant to section 50-2006, Idaho Code.\n\n(3) \"Authorized municipality\" or \"municipality\" means any county or incorporated city that has established an urban renewal agency or by ordinance has identified and created a competitively disadvantaged border community.\n\n(4) Except as provided in section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, \"base assessment roll\" means the equalized assessment rolls, for all classes of taxable property, on January 1 of the year in which the local governing body of an authorized municipality passes an ordinance adopting or modifying an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision, except that the base assessment roll shall be adjusted as follows: the equalized assessment valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area as shown upon the base assessment roll shall be reduced by the amount by which the equalized assessed valuation as shown on the base assessment roll exceeds the current equalized assessed valuation of any taxable property located in the revenue allocation area and by the equalized assessed valuation of taxable property in such revenue allocation area that becomes exempt from taxation subsequent to the date of the base assessment roll. The equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area as shown on the base assessment roll shall be increased by the equalized assessed valuation, as of the date of the base assessment roll, of taxable property in such revenue allocation area that becomes taxable after the date of the base assessment roll. Any increase in valuation due to property owned, leased, or used in the operation of a business entity that makes capital investments in one (1) or more data centers, as defined in section 63-3622VV(2)(f), Idaho Code, after July 1, 2020, in amounts of at least two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) in the aggregate within the first five (5) years after commencement of construction, that creates and maintains at least thirty (30) new jobs at the data center within two (2) calendar years after the commencement of operations, and that is located in a revenue allocation area for which no bonds have been issued pursuant to section 50-2909, Idaho Code, as of March 16, 2023, shall be added to the base assessment roll in the current tax year. An urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision adopted or modified prior to July 1, 2016, is not subject to section 50-2903A, Idaho Code. For plans adopted or modified prior to July 1, 2016, and for subsequent modifications of those urban renewal plans, the value of the base assessment roll of property within the revenue allocation area shall be determined as if the modification had not occurred.\n\n(5) \"Budget\" means an annual estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the agency. An agency shall, by September 1 of each calendar year, adopt and publish, as described in section 50-1002, Idaho Code, a budget for the next fiscal year. An agency may amend its adopted budget using the same procedures as used for adoption of the budget. For the fiscal year that immediately predates the termination date for an urban renewal plan involving a revenue allocation area or will include the termination date, the agency shall adopt and publish a budget specifically for the projected revenues and expenses of the plan and make a determination as to whether the revenue allocation area can be terminated before the January 1 of the termination year pursuant to the terms of section 50-2909(4), Idaho Code. In the event that the agency determines that current tax year revenues are sufficient to cover all estimated expenses for the current year and all future years, by September 1 the agency shall adopt a resolution advising and notifying the local governing body, the county auditor, and the state tax commission and recommending the adoption of an ordinance for termination of the revenue allocation area by December 31 of the current year and declaring a surplus to be distributed as described in section 50-2909, Idaho Code, should a surplus be determined to exist. The agency shall cause the ordinance to be filed with the office of the county recorder and the Idaho state tax commission as provided in section 63-215, Idaho Code. Upon notification of revenues sufficient to cover expenses as provided herein, the increment value of that revenue allocation area shall be included in the net taxable value of the appropriate taxing districts when calculating the subsequent property tax levies pursuant to section 63-803, Idaho Code. The increment value shall also be included in subsequent notification of taxable value for each taxing district pursuant to section 63-1312, Idaho Code, and subsequent certification of actual and adjusted market values for each school district pursuant to section 63-315, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) \"Clerk\" means the clerk of the municipality.\n\n(7) \"Competitively disadvantaged border community area\" means a parcel of land consisting of at least forty (40) acres that is situated within the jurisdiction of a county or an incorporated city and within twenty-five (25) miles of a state or international border, which the governing body of such county or incorporated city has determined by ordinance is disadvantaged in its ability to attract business, private investment, or commercial development as a result of a competitive advantage in the adjacent state or nation resulting from inequities or disparities in comparative sales taxes, income taxes, property taxes, population or unique geographic features.\n\n(8) \"Deteriorated area\" means:\n\n(a) Any area, including a slum area, in which there is a predominance of buildings or improvements, whether residential or nonresidential, which by reason of dilapidation, deterioration, age or obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation, or open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, or the existence of conditions that endanger life or property by fire and other causes, or any combination of such factors, is conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, or crime, and is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or welfare.\n\n(b) Any area which by reason of the presence of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street layout, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness, insanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special assessment delinquency exceeding the fair value of the land, defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of conditions that endanger life or property by fire and other causes, or any combination of such factors, results in economic underdevelopment of the area, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic or social liability and is a menace to the public health, safety, morals or welfare in its present condition and use.\n\n(c) Any area which is predominately open and which because of obsolete platting, diversity of ownership, deterioration of structures or improvements, or otherwise, results in economic underdevelopment of the area or substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of a municipality.

EFFECT OF ORDINANCE TO MODIFY URBAN RENEWAL PLAN — EXCEPTION.\n\n(1)(a) On and after July 1, 2016, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, when an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision is modified through an ordinance of the authorized municipality, the base value for the year immediately following the year in which the modification occurred shall include the current year’s equalized assessed value of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area. The urban renewal agency shall be required annually to attest to having or not having modified any of its plans. If no modification has occurred, the urban renewal agency shall attest that fact on an affidavit provided by the state tax commission before the first Monday in June of each year. Modification shall not be deemed to have occurred when:\n\n(i) There is a plan amendment to make technical or ministerial changes to a plan that does not involve an increase in the use of revenues allocated to the agency pursuant to section 50-2908, Idaho Code; or\n\n(ii) There is a plan amendment to accommodate an increase in the revenue allocation area boundary as permitted in section 50-2033, Idaho Code; or\n\n(iii) There is a plan amendment to accommodate a de-annexation in the revenue allocation area boundary; or\n\n(iv) There is a plan amendment to support growth or development of a commercial, manufacturing, or industrial project in an existing revenue allocation area, subject to the provisions of section 50-2905A, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Notice of any plan modification shall state the nature of the modification and shall be provided to the state tax commission, the county clerk and the county assessor by the first Monday in June of the years following the modification.\n\n(c) Once a modification is deemed to have occurred, the base assessment value shall be reset pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(2) When the urban renewal agency certifies to the county clerk and state tax commission that there is outstanding indebtedness, the base value for the year immediately following the year in which the modification occurred shall be computed and adjusted irrespective of the modification to the plan, but in compliance with all other requirements for adjustment as provided in section 50-2903(4), Idaho Code. To be allowed this exception no later than the first Monday in June each year, beginning the year immediately following the year in which the modification occurred, the urban renewal agency must certify:\n\n(a) That the indebtedness could not be repaid by the agency prior to the termination of the revenue allocation area without the allocation of property tax revenues as provided in section 50-2908, Idaho Code; and\n\n(b) The estimated total budget to be used for paying indebtedness during each year until termination of the revenue allocation area, the amount of nonproperty tax revenue to be used by the agency to pay indebtedness each year, and the estimated amount of revenue to be allocated to the agency for the modified revenue allocation area pursuant to section 50-2908, Idaho Code, to be used for paying indebtedness. For purposes of this section \"indebtedness\" shall mean any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, interim certificates, certificates of indebtedness, debentures or other obligations, together with all expenses necessary to comply with all covenants related to the indebtedness.\n\n(3) To the extent the amount of revenue allocated to the modified revenue allocation area pursuant to section 50-2908, Idaho Code, exceeds the amount necessary to pay indebtedness certified in subsection (2)(b) of this section, the excess shall be distributed by the county clerk to each taxing district or unit in the same manner as property taxes, except that each taxing district or unit shall be notified of the amount of any distribution of excess urban renewal allocations included in any distribution. For purposes of the limitation provided by section 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received by any taxing district or unit pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as property tax revenue.\n\n(4) Within thirty (30) days from the time the state tax commission receives information that an urban renewal plan for a revenue allocation area has been modified, the state tax commission shall notify the urban renewal agency and the county clerk of such receipt and the determination regarding any limits on the maximum amount of property tax revenue that will be allocated to the urban renewal agency from the current year’s property taxes.\n\n[50-2903A, added 2016, ch. 349, sec. 4, p. 1021; am. 2025, ch. 300, sec. 3, p. 1260.]",

An authorized municipality is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt, at any time, a revenue allocation financing provision, as described in this chapter, as part of an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance. A revenue allocation financing provision may be adopted either at the time of the original adoption of an urban renewal plan or the creation by ordinance of a competitively disadvantaged border community area or thereafter as a modification of an urban renewal plan or the ordinance creating the competitively disadvantaged border community area. Urban renewal plans existing prior to the effective date of this section may be modified to include a revenue allocation financing provision. Except as provided in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, no revenue allocation provision of an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance, including all amendments thereto, shall have a duration exceeding twenty (20) years from the date the ordinance is approved by the municipality; and provided further, no additions to the land area of an existing revenue allocation area shall be interpreted to or shall cause an extension of the date of the twenty (20) year limit that was originally established for the revenue allocation area. Notwithstanding these limitations, the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision may be extended if:\n\n(1) The maturity date of any bonds issued to provide funds for a specific project in the revenue allocation area and payable from the revenue allocation financing provision exceeds the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision, provided such bond maturity is not greater than twenty (20) years; or\n\n(2) The urban renewal agency determines that it is necessary to refinance outstanding bonds payable from the revenue allocation financing provision to a maturity exceeding the twenty (20) year duration of the revenue allocation financing provision in order to avoid a default on the bonds; or\n\n(3) The local governing body has adopted an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or an amendment to an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance prior to July 1, 2000, in which is defined the duration of the plan beyond a period of twenty (20) years, in which case the revenue allocation provision shall have a duration as described in such urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or may be extended as set forth in subsection (2) of this section; or\n\n(4) The local governing body has adopted an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or an amendment to an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance after July 1, 2000, and prior to July 1, 2011, in which is defined the duration of the plan beyond a period of twenty (20) years in which case the revenue allocation provision shall have a duration as described in such urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance. The duration of the revenue allocation financing provision set forth in this subsection may be extended if the maturity date of any bonds issued to provide funds for a specific project in the revenue allocation area and payable from the revenue allocation financing provision exceeds the duration of the revenue allocation financing provision, provided such bond maturity is not greater than thirty (30) years or may be extended as set forth in subsection (2) of this section; or\n\n(5) There is a plan amendment of an existing revenue allocation area to support growth or development of a manufacturing project where the revenue allocation area includes only parcels that are owned or controlled by the project owner and its affiliates, in which case the revenue allocation area financing provision may be extended for up to twenty (20) years during which the agency will continue to receive revenue allocation proceeds under section 50-2908, Idaho Code, until termination pursuant to the new termination date as approved in the plan amendment. For the purposes of this subsection \"controlled by\" means that the project owner or its affiliates have entered into a binding contract leasing a parcel that will extend for the duration of the proposed extension of the revenue allocation area financing provision.\n\n(6) During the extension set forth in subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, any revenue allocation area revenues exceeding the amount necessary to repay the bonds during the period exceeding the maximum year maturity of the revenue allocation financing provision shall be returned to the taxing districts in the revenue allocation area on a pro rata basis.\n\n[50-2904, added 1988, ch. 210, sec. 4, p. 396; am. 1994, ch. 381, sec. 3, p. 1226; am. 2000, ch. 275, sec. 2, p. 896; am. 2002, ch. 143, sec. 3, p. 400; am. 2009, ch. 218, sec. 1, p. 680; am. 2011, ch. 317, sec. 7, p. 922; am. 2025, ch. 300, sec. 4, p. 1261.]",

(1) To adopt a new urban renewal plan or create a competitively disadvantaged border community area containing a revenue allocation financing provision, the local governing body of an authorized municipality must enact an ordinance in accordance with chapter 9, title 50, Idaho Code, and section 50-2008, Idaho Code. To modify an existing urban renewal plan, to add or change a revenue allocation, an authorized municipality must enact an ordinance in accordance with chapter 9, title 50, Idaho Code, and conduct a public hearing as provided in section 50-2008(c), Idaho Code. No urban renewal project, plan, competitively disadvantaged border community area or modification thereto, or revenue allocation financial provision shall be held ineffective for failure to comply with the requirements of this section if compliance with the section is substantial and in good faith and administrative authority of both the local governing body and urban renewal agency does not extend beyond the municipal boundary of the authorized municipality. Urban renewal plans and revenue allocation financing provisions may be held ineffective if an urban renewal area or revenue allocation area extends outside the municipal boundary of an authorized municipality and a transfer of powers ordinance has not been adopted by the cooperating county.\n\n(2) A revenue allocation financing provision adopted in accordance with this chapter shall be effective retroactively to January 1 of the year in which the local governing body of the authorized municipality enacts such ordinance.\n\n(3)(a) Prior to taking action on an ordinance to adopt a revenue allocation financing provision, the local governing body of an authorized municipality shall prepare a notice stating:\n\n(i) That an urban renewal plan or modification thereto or a competitively disadvantaged border community area has been proposed and is being considered for adoption, and that such plan or modification thereto or proposal to create a competitively disadvantaged border community area contains a revenue allocation financing provision that will cause property taxes resulting from any increases in equalized assessed valuation in excess of the equalized assessed valuation as shown on the base assessment roll to be allocated to the agency for urban renewal and competitively disadvantaged border community area purposes;\n\n(ii) That an agreement on the administration of a revenue allocation financing provision extending beyond the municipal boundary of the authorized municipality has been negotiated with the cooperating county having extraterritorial power and that the agreement has been formalized by a transfer of power ordinance adopted by that county; and\n\n(iii) That a public hearing on such plan or modification will be held by the local governing body pursuant to section 50-2008(c), Idaho Code.\n\n(b) The notice shall also state the time, date, and place of the hearing. At least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date set for final reading of the ordinance, the local governing body shall publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation and transmit the notice, together with a copy of the plan and recommendation of the urban renewal agency or the municipality which by ordinance created the competitively disadvantaged border community area, to the governing body of each taxing district which levies taxes upon any taxable property in the revenue allocation area and which would be affected by the revenue allocation financing provision of the urban renewal plan proposed to be approved by the local governing body.\n\n(4) No fire protection district or ambulance service district shall be subject to the financing provisions of an urban renewal revenue allocation area, or any modification thereof, created or modified after July 1, 2025, unless the local governing body of the authorized municipality proposing to create or modify such financing provision requests such district to consent to be subject to the financing provision and the district receiving such request consents. To request such a district to consent, the local governing body of an authorized municipality shall send a request to the district at the same time it sends notice to taxing districts of its intent to create or modify an urban renewal plan that includes a revenue allocation financing provision pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. If the governing board of the district receiving a request to consent agrees with the request, it shall adopt a resolution providing that such district shall be subject to the financing provisions of the proposed urban renewal area plan or proposed urban renewal area plan modification that was identified in the request, and shall thereafter be subject to such financing provision. The consenting district shall, within ten (10) business days, file a copy of the resolution with the local governing body of the authorized municipality. Upon receipt of the district’s resolution consenting to be subject to the financing provision, the governing body of the municipality shall transmit a copy of such resolution to the county clerk and the state tax commission within ten (10) business days.\n\n(5)(a) Any fire protection district or ambulance service district may withdraw from being subject to an urban renewal revenue allocation financing provision under an urban renewal plan established by local governing body ordinance prior to July 1, 2025, if the urban renewal plan establishing the revenue allocation financing provision does not have any outstanding bonds, contractual obligations, or other indebtedness being funded by such revenue allocation financing provision greater than the amount of the revenue allocation proceeds that was attributable to the fire protection district or ambulance service district as of December 31 of the immediate prior tax year.\n\n(b) Any fire protection district or ambulance service district that seeks to withdraw shall:\n\n(i) By May 1 of the withdrawal year request an accounting from the county showing the amount of revenue allocation proceeds that was attributable to the fire protection district or ambulance service district as of December 31 of the immediate prior tax year. A copy of the accounting shall be simultaneously transmitted by the county to the requesting district and the agency within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request from the district; and\n\n(ii) By June 1 of the withdrawal year adopt a resolution expressing an intent to withdraw and transmit the same to the urban renewal agency that governs the urban renewal plan and revenue allocation financing provision that the district seeks to withdraw from.\n\n(c) The agency shall schedule a special meeting within ten (10) business days of receipt of the fire protection district’s or ambulance service district’s resolution approving the withdrawal and the accounting from the county to accept the request to withdraw by agency resolution, or to deny the request to withdraw in writing due to the existence of outstanding bonds, contractual obligations, or other indebtedness being funded by the district’s revenue allocation proceeds, and setting forth specific information about the indebtedness.\n\n(d) If the withdrawal is accepted, the urban renewal agency shall transmit a copy of the district resolution and the agency resolution to the county clerk, the county recorder, and the state tax commission no later than the fourth Monday of July. If the resolutions are received by the state tax commission and the county by the fourth Monday of July, then the levy rate for the next fiscal year will be calculated pursuant to section 50-2908(1)(g), Idaho Code, and any budget increases as set forth in sections 63-802 and 63-301A, Idaho Code. If the resolutions are transmitted to the county clerk, the county recorder, and the state tax commission after the fourth Monday of July, then the effect of the withdrawal will be the following tax year.\n\n[50-2906, added 1988, ch. 210, sec. 6, p. 397; am. 1994, ch. 381, sec. 4, p. 1227; am. 2000, ch. 162, sec. 1, p. 410; am. 2000, ch. 275, sec. 3, p. 897; am. 2025, ch. 300, sec. 5, p. 1263.]",

(1) For purposes of calculating the rate at which taxes shall be levied by or for each taxing district in which a revenue allocation area is located, the county commissioners shall, with respect to the taxable property located in such revenue allocation area, use the equalized assessed value of such taxable property as shown on the base assessment roll rather than on the current equalized assessed valuation of such taxable property, except the current equalized assessed valuation shall be used for calculating the tax rate for:\n\n(a) Levies for refunds and credits pursuant to section 63-1305, Idaho Code, and any judgment pursuant to section 33-802(1), Idaho Code, certified after December 31, 2007;\n\n(b) Levies permitted pursuant to section 63-802(3), Idaho Code, certified after December 31, 2007;\n\n(c) Levies for voter-approved general obligation bonds of any taxing district and plant facility reserve fund levies passed after December 31, 2007;\n\n(d) Levies for payment of obligations that have been judicially confirmed pursuant to chapter 13, title 7, Idaho Code, and that meet the criteria of sections 63-1315 and 63-1316, Idaho Code;\n\n(e) Levies set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection, first certified prior to December 31, 2007, when the property affected by said levies is included within the boundaries of a revenue allocation area by a change in the boundaries of either the revenue allocation area or any taxing district after December 31, 2007;\n\n(f) School levies for supplemental maintenance and operation pursuant to section 33-802(3) and (4), Idaho Code, approved after December 31, 2007, and for emergency funds pursuant to section 33-805, Idaho Code, approved after July 1, 2015; and\n\n(g) Levies of fire protection districts pursuant to chapter 14, title 31, Idaho Code, and ambulance services districts pursuant to chapter 39, title 31, Idaho Code, that are exempt from being subject to a revenue allocation financing provision pursuant to section 50-2906(4), Idaho Code, or that withdraw from being subject to a revenue allocation financing provision pursuant to section 50-2906(5), Idaho Code.\n\n(2) With respect to each such taxing district, the tax rate calculated under subsection (1) of this section shall be applied to the current equalized assessed valuation of all taxable property in the taxing district, including the taxable property in the revenue allocation area.

For purposes of this section, \"urban renewal agency\" shall have the same meaning as provided in chapters 20 and 29, title 50, Idaho Code.\n\n(1) (a) There is hereby established a central registry with the state tax commission. The registry shall serve as the unified location for the reporting of and access to administrative and financial information of urban renewal plans in this state. To establish a complete list of all urban renewal plans of urban renewal agencies operating in Idaho, on the effective date of this act and so that the registry established will be comprehensive, every urban renewal agency shall register with the state registry. For calendar year 2017, the submission of information required by subsection (2) of this section shall occur prior to March 1, 2017, and shall be in the form and format required by the state tax commission.

Upon receipt of such notification, the board of county commissioners shall place a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county indicating that the entity is noncompliant with the legal reporting requirements of this section. The county commissioners shall assess to the entity the cost of the public notice. Such costs may be deducted from any distributions of tax increment financing of the urban renewal agency. For any noncomplying urban renewal agency, the state tax commission shall notify the board of county commissioners and city council of the compliance status of such entity by September 1 of each year until the entity is in compliance.\n\n(c) An urban renewal agency that fails to comply with this section shall have any property tax revenue that exceeds the amount received in the immediate prior tax year distributed to the taxing districts located in or overlapping any revenue allocation area within that urban renewal district.

Such fee shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). Such fees and costs may be deducted from any distributions of the tax increment financing. Any fee collected shall be deposited into the county’s current expense fund.\n\n(4) The provisions of this section shall have no impact or effect upon reporting requirements for local governing entities relating to the state tax commission.

      "text": "50-2914. TERMINATION OF AN URBAN RENEWAL PLAN AND REVENUE ALLOCATION FINANCING PROVISION. (1) An urban renewal agency may terminate an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision on or before the termination date in accordance with the provisions of sections 50-2903(5) and 50-2909(4), Idaho Code. The urban renewal agency shall consider its ability to receive revenue in the year following the termination date when determining the timing of termination and the termination date.\n\n(2) The local governing body of the municipality may initiate termination of an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision before the termination date as follows:\n\n(a) The local governing body may adopt a resolution that directs the urban renewal agency to provide a termination plan for the termination of a specified urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision to the local governing body within sixty (60) days of the agency’s receipt of the local governing body’s resolution, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the local governing body. Upon the adoption of the resolution, the urban renewal agency governing the urban renewal plan identified in the resolution shall no longer have the authority to enter into any financial obligations secured by the funding from any urban renewal financing provision of any urban renewal plan specified in the resolution, other than such obligations as are necessary to facilitate the termination of the urban renewal plan.\n\n(b) The termination plan submitted by the urban renewal agency shall include a detailed summary of all agency obligations under such urban renewal plan and anticipated future obligations to implement the plan through the duration of the plan, including information on the use of revenues collected to fund specific projects and any capital improvement project plans. The termination plan shall also include a proposed termination timeline.\n\n(c) The local governing body may then enact an ordinance terminating the urban renewal plan and any revenue allocation financing provisions included in such plan. The ordinance shall be recorded in the real property records of the county in which the agency operated. The local governing body shall transmit a copy of the recorded termination ordinance to the county clerk, any affected taxing districts, and the state tax commission within ten (10) business days of the recording date.\n\n[50-2914, added 2025, ch. 300, sec. 8, p. 1267.]",
