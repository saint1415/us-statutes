All or part of any issue may be refunded and all or part of several issues may be refunded into a single issue of refunding bonds. There may be included with the refunding bonds, as part of a single issue, or in combination in one (1) or more series, bonds for any other purpose or purposes for which bonds are authorized to be issued under the revenue bond act. Refunding bonds shall be issued and secured in such manner as may be provided in the proceedings authorizing their issuance and as otherwise provided in the revenue bond act, and such changes may be made in the security and revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds so refunded, as provided by the governing body in the proceedings authorizing such bonds. No election on the issuance of refunding bonds shall be required, but if by an increase in the amount of bonds or by changes in the security or pledged revenues, the requirements of the constitution for an election shall become applicable, or if refunding bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes, then such bonds with changes in security or revenues, or such bonds in excess of the amount of bonds refunded, as the case may be, must have been approved at an election as otherwise provided in the revenue bond act and the constitution. Refunding bonds may be exchanged for not less than a like principal amount of bonds authorized to be refunded, may be sold, or may be exchanged in part and sold in part. If sold, the proceeds of the sale, not required for the payment of expenses, and in any event, in an amount sufficient to assure the retirement of the bonds refundable, when such bonds become available for retirement, if not applied to a simultaneous payment and cancellation of the bonds refunded shall be escrowed with a bank or trust company and may be invested in United States government obligations or in obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America in such manner as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings;\n\n(j) To issue its revenue bonds for airport facilities and air navigation facilities to be held by the political subdivision of the state or regional airport authority as defined by law payable solely from fees, charges, rents, payments, grants or any other revenues derived from the airport or any of its facilities, structures, systems of projects, or from any land, facilities, buildings, projects or other property financed by such bonds; and to issue special facility bonds for airport facilities and air navigation facilities to be financed for, or to be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of to private persons, associations or corporations, to pledge to the payment of such bonds the fees, charges, rents, payments, grants, or any other revenues from the financed facilities and to secure such bonds by a deed of trust, mortgage or other lien on the financed property or by other security or credit enhancement; and neither airport revenue bonds nor special facility bonds shall be secured by the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the political subdivision of the state or regional airport authority as defined by law.\n\n[50-1030, added 1967, ch. 429, sec. 190, p. 1249; am. 1971, ch. 112, sec. 1, p. 383; am. 1977, ch. 50, sec. 2, p. 92; am. 1987, ch. 206, sec. 1, p. 433; am. 2011, ch. 129, sec. 2, p. 359.]",
