(1) The legislature finds that the development of architectural themes for cities is a legitimate method to further the public health, safety and welfare of cities. The purpose of the provisions of this section is to authorize cities to create local business improvement districts for the purpose of constructing and financing the cost and expense of improvements to the exterior portions of business buildings to bring business buildings within the district into conformity with the architectural theme adopted by the city. The improvement of business buildings in conformity with the architectural theme adopted by the city is hereby declared a public purpose.\n\n(2) Municipalities are hereby authorized to create local business improvement districts for the purpose of constructing and financing the cost and expense of improvements to the exterior portions of business buildings in order to bring business buildings within such districts into conformity with an architectural theme adopted by the city.\n\n(3) The term \"business building\" includes any building devoted primarily to business purposes, including professional and governmental purposes.\n\n(4) It is the intent of the provisions of this section that local business improvement districts be administered in all respects as are local improvement districts, except as provided herein.\n\n(5) Local business improvement districts shall be initiated by presentment to the council of a petition containing the following:\n\n(a) A description of the particular lots and parcels to be included in the proposed district;\n\n(b) A description of the improvements to be constructed and financed by the district;\n\n(c) The estimated cost of the improvements;\n\n(d) The percentage of the cost to be assessed against each lot and parcel within the district; and\n\n(e) The signature of the owner of record of each lot or parcel to be included within the district, consenting to inclusion of the lot or parcel within the district.\n\n(6) The total project amount assessed against each parcel within the district shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of the market value for assessment purposes of the parcel.\n\n(7) Lots and parcels need not be contiguous in order to be included within a district. No lot or parcel may be included within a district without the written consent of the owner thereof; provided, that, after the district has been created, consent to inclusion in the district may not subsequently be withdrawn prior to payment of all costs of the improvements.\n\n(8) Upon receipt of the petition, the council shall adopt a resolution of intention, substantially in the form provided in section 50-1707, Idaho Code, stating the council’s intention to create the district, to make the improvements, and to levy assessments to pay the cost thereof. The resolution shall contain a statement as to the percentage of the costs to be assessed against each particular lot or parcel within the proposed district.\n\n(9) Notice shall be given and a hearing conducted in the manner provided in sections 50-1708 and 50-1709, Idaho Code. If, after such hearing, the council determines to create the district, it shall proceed as provided in this chapter for the creation of the district, the construction of the improvements, the preparation of, hearing upon, and confirmation of the assessment roll, the collection of assessments and the issuance of bonds or warrants. Each assessment shall be a lien upon the property against which it is assessed, as provided in section 50-1721, Idaho Code.\n\n[50-1703A, added 1987, ch. 26, sec. 1, p. 35.]",

(1) After said hearing, the council shall pass an ordinance confirming the assessment roll as corrected by the council in relation to the benefits accruing thereon as a result of the improvements being made. The ordinance shall be the final determination of the regularity, validity and correctness of the assessment roll, of each assessment contained therein, and of the amount thereof levied on each lot or parcel of land, which ordinance shall contain a finding that each lot or parcel of land is benefited to the amount of assessment levied thereon subject to appeal as provided herein. Upon passage of the ordinance, the clerk shall certify and file the confirmed assessment roll with the treasurer of the municipality and the assessments therein shall be due and payable to the treasurer within thirty (30) days from the date of the adoption of the ordinance. The confirmed assessment roll and the assessments made by the confirmed assessment roll shall be a lien upon the property assessed from and after the date the following notice is recorded. Immediately upon passage of the confirming ordinance, the clerk shall file with the county recorder a notice which shall contain the date of the confirming ordinance and a description of the area or boundaries of the district. If any assessment is not paid in full within said thirty (30) day period, such assessment shall become delinquent and shall be collected in the same manner and with the same penalties and interest added thereto as hereinafter provided for delinquent assessments. The council may, in the alternative, determine to make assessments unpaid at the end of said thirty (30) day period payable in installments and to issue and sell registered warrants or installment bonds payable from such unpaid installments as herein provided. If the council chooses to do so, it shall provide in said ordinance that any property owner who has not paid his assessment in full within said thirty (30) day period will be conclusively presumed to have chosen to pay the same in installments, and the ordinance shall then establish the number of years said installments shall run, the dates of payment of the same, and the rate of interest that the unpaid assessments shall bear, which rate shall not be less than the rate of interest borne by the warrants or bonds payable therefrom, said interest running from the date of the passage of the assessment ordinance, irrespective of the date of its official publication, and being payable at the same time and place as the installment payments of assessments. Said installments shall be due and payable in not to exceed thirty (30) years to the treasurer or other proper officer as provided by the council. The ordinance shall establish the due date of the first installment payment and that the local or special assessments may be carried on the rolls of the municipality and collected as hereinafter provided. If any installment is not paid within twenty (20) days from the date it is due, the same shall become delinquent and the treasurer shall add a penalty of two percent (2%) thereto. In addition to any other method of collection provided in this code, the council may certify delinquent installments to the tax collector, and when so certified they shall be extended on the tax rolls and collected as are property taxes, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 10, title 63, Idaho Code. In the event that any property owner should choose to pay his assessment in full after such time as it has been conclusively presumed that he will pay in installments, such payment in full shall include the full amount of the unpaid assessment plus penalties and all interest payable on the same plus additional interest thereon at the rate provided in the bonds from the date of the last installment due to one (1) year after the next interest date of said bonds.\n\n(2) Any errors in description, ownership of property, or amounts in any assessment ordinance adopted pursuant to this section may be corrected by the passage of an amendatory ordinance, which need set forth only the corrected descriptions or amounts. The passage of such amendatory ordinance shall serve only to postpone the thirty (30) day period for payment in full of the assessments actually affected by such amendatory ordinance, and the due dates of installments of such affected assessments shall be the same as the due dates of installments not affected. Notice of any assessments so affected shall be given in the same manner as hereinafter provided for the giving of notice of assessments.\n\n[50-1715, added 1976, ch. 160, sec. 2, p. 579; am. 1983, ch. 41, sec. 1, p. 98.; am. 2020, ch. 273, sec. 2, p. 806.]",
