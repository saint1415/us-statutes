Whenever the city council proposes to convey, exchange or offer for sale any real property, it shall first declare the value or minimum price, if any, it intends to receive as a result of such conveyance or exchange. The city council may contract for or provide that the property be appraised under such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the city council. The declaration, either in the form of a minimum dollar value, or an explanation of an intended exchange or conveyance for other than monetary consideration shall be made on the record at a public meeting of the council. The city council may also declare that the subject property will be offered for sale without establishing a minimum price.\n\nFollowing a declaration of intent to sell or exchange real property, the clerk of the city shall publish a summary of the action taken by the city council in the official newspaper of the city and provide notice of a public hearing before the city council. Notice of the public hearing concerning the proposed exchange or conveyance shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing.\n\n[50-1402, added 1967, ch. 429, sec. 245, p. 1249; am. 2001, ch. 331, sec. 2, p. 1162.]",

After a public hearing has been conducted, the city council may proceed to exchange, convey or offer for sale the real property in question, subject to the restrictions of section 50-1401, Idaho Code. The city council shall be governed by the following provisions:\n\n(1) When the property is offered for sale, the property shall be sold at a public auction to the highest bidder and no bids shall be accepted for less than the minimum declared value previously recorded on the record at a public meeting of the council, provided however, if no bids are received, the city council shall have the authority to sell such property as it deems in the best interest of the city.\n\n(2) When it is determined by the city council to be in the city’s best interest that the property be offered for exchange, the council may do all things necessary to exchange any property owned by the city for real property of equal value pursuant to terms which shall be a matter of public record.\n\n(3) When property is purchased, donated or otherwise conveyed to a city and the city has previously used federal funding to acquire the property, with funds specifically designated for the purpose of assisting low- to moderate-income families with decent, safe, affordable housing opportunities, the property may be sold, donated or otherwise conveyed directly to a low- to moderate-income family, so long as the sale or conveyance is consistent with the applicable federal regulations under which the property was obtained initially. In such instances, the city council shall pass an ordinance stating:\n\n(a) That the property was acquired, in whole, with federal funds;\n\n(b) That the property is to be sold or otherwise conveyed to a low- to moderate-income family;\n\n(c) That the sale or conveyance is consistent with all applicable federal, state or local statutes, laws, regulations and policies; and\n\n(d) That the property may be offered for sale, donation or otherwise conveyed immediately upon the passing of the ordinance.\n\n(4) When it is determined by the city council to be in the city’s best interest that a transfer or conveyance be made, the city council may, by ordinance duly enacted, authorize the transfer or conveyance of any real property owned by such city to any tax supported governmental unit, with or without consideration.\n\n(5) When it is determined by the city council to be in the city’s best interest, the city may transfer property to a trustee for security purposes, or for purposes of accommodating a transaction, or for funding of construction of capital facilities on city owned property.\n\n[50-1403, added 2001, ch. 331, sec. 4, p. 1162.]",
