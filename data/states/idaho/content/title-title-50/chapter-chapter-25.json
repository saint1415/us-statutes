In the event the extension or conversion costs are less than the estimated extension or conversion costs, each owner within the improvement district shall receive the benefit, prorated in such form and at such times as the governing body may determine. The bill of the public utility corporation shall be paid within thirty (30) days by the governing body from the improvement district funds or such other source as is properly designated by the governing body. In determining the actual cost of constructing the facility the public utility shall use its standard accounting procedures, such as the uniform system of accounts as defined by the state or federal regulatory commission and as is in use at the time of the extension or conversion by the public utility involved. All rules and regulations of the utility pertaining to refund provisions for line extensions will also be applicable to an improvement district.\n\n[50-2518, as added by 1971, ch. 212, sec. 1, p. 923; am. 1991, ch. 301, sec. 10, p. 796.]",
