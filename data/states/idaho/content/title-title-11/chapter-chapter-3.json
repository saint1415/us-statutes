Any excess in the proceeds over the judgment and accruing costs must be returned to the judgment debtor unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of the court. When there is more property of the judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs within the view of the sheriff, he must levy only on such part of the property as the judgment debtor may indicate, if the property indicated be amply sufficient to satisfy the judgment and costs.\n\nThe provisions of sections 11-703, 11-706, 11-707, 11-709 and 11-710, Idaho Code, shall apply to a levy upon personal property.\n\n[(11-301) C.C.P. 1881, sec. 441; R.S., R.C., & C.L., sec. 4481; C.S., sec. 6921; I.C.A., sec. 8-301; am. 1991, ch. 165, sec. 12, p. 405; am. 2017, ch. 303, sec. 7, p. 802.]",
