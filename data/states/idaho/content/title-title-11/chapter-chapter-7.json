Such office may be located either within or outside the state of Idaho. The Idaho department of finance shall post the list of such designated offices on its web page for access by the public.\n\n(4) If a financial institution operating more than one (1) office where deposits are received has designated a particular office for the attachment, execution, or garnishment, then service of such papers made on the office so designated shall be valid and effective as to moneys to the judgment debtor’s credit held in the possession or control of any of the financial institution’s branches or offices located within or outside the state of Idaho.\n\n(5) If service of the attachment, execution or garnishment papers is not made on the designated office of the financial institution, but instead is made on another office of the financial institution located in the state of Idaho, then service of such papers shall be valid and effective as to moneys to the judgment debtor’s credit in that particular office and as to other personal property belonging to the judgment debtor held in the possession or control of that particular office, but shall only become valid and effective as to moneys to the judgment debtor’s credit held in the possession or control of any of the financial institution’s other offices upon receipt of the attachment, execution or garnishment papers by the designated office. Such financial institution may, but is under no obligation to, transmit the original or a copy of the papers from the particular office served to the designated office.\n\n(6) Service on any financial institution is effective as against the moneys and other personal property to the judgment debtor’s credit which are in the possession or control of the financial institution named in the garnishment, but not any affiliate, parent or subsidiary not named. If the garnishment fails to sufficiently distinguish the financial institution from any affiliate, parent or subsidiary thereof, such that it is not clear which entity is intended to be the garnishee, the garnishment may be returned unsatisfied.\n\n(7) The provisions of this section and sections 11-706, 11-707, 11-709 and 11-710, Idaho Code, shall apply to any levy by execution pursuant to chapter 5, title 8, Idaho Code.\n\n[11-703, added 2017, ch. 303, sec. 9, p. 804; am. 2021, ch. 186, sec. 1, p. 509.]",

The financial institution conducting the garnishment review shall have no obligation to inquire into the source of funds or examine any deposit item made by any means other than direct or electronic deposit, even if such review would disclose that the funds so deposited may be exempt from garnishment as described in section 11-713(1), (2) or (3), Idaho Code.\n\n(4) If a notice of right to garnish federal benefits from the United States government or from a state child support enforcement agency is attached to or included in the garnishment as provided in 31 CFR 212, the financial institution shall not conduct a garnishment account review under this section and shall proceed on the garnishment.\n\n(5) A financial institution conducting a garnishment review as required by this section is immune from civil liability to the garnishor, debtor or account owner from any act or omission with respect to the garnishment review, including without limitation any incorrect determination made after applying good faith methods for determining whether funds in an account are exempt. If a court determines that a financial institution erred in its identification of funds in an account as exempt or nonexempt, the sole remedy in exemption proceedings shall be issuance of an order of the court that the financial institution must adjust its actions with respect to a writ of execution as soon as possible.
