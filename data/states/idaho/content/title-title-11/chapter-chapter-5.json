When an execution against property of the judgment debtor or of any of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he do not reside in this state, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment roll is filed, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return is made, is entitled to an order from the judge of the court requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer upon oath concerning his property, before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, at a time and place specified in the order; but no judgment debtor must be required to attend before a judge or referee out of the county in which he resides.\n\n[(11-501) C.C.P. 1881, sec. 460; R.S., R.C., & C.L., sec. 4504; C.S., sec. 6941; I.C.A., sec. 8-501.]",

After the issuing of an execution against property, and upon proof by affidavit of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court or of a judge thereof, that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, to answer upon oath concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided upon the return of an execution. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may upon affidavit of the judgment creditor, his agent or attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the debtor absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the debtor and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, with sufficient surety, that he will attend from time to time before the judge or referee, as may be directed during the pendency of proceedings and until the final termination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of his property not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking he may be committed to prison.\n\n[(11-502) C.C.P. 1881, sec. 461; R.S., R.C., & C.L., sec. 4505; C.S., sec. 6942; I.C.A., sec. 8-502.]",
