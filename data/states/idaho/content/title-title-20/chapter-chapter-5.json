      "text": "20-501. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) It is the policy of the state of Idaho that the juvenile corrections system will be based on the following principles: accountability, community protection, and competency development. Where a juvenile has been found to be within the purview of the juvenile corrections act, the court shall impose a sentence that will protect the community, hold the juvenile offender accountable for his actions, and assist the juvenile offender in developing skills to become a contributing member of a diverse community. It is the further policy of the state of Idaho that the parents or other legal guardians of the juvenile offender participate in the accomplishment of these goals through participation in counseling and treatment designed to develop positive parenting skills and an understanding of the family’s role in the juvenile offender’s behavior. It is the further intent of the legislature that the parents of the juvenile offender be held accountable, where appropriate, through monetary reimbursement for supervision and confinement of the juvenile offender and restitution to victims of the juvenile offender’s delinquent acts. In enacting this legislation, the legislature finds that the juvenile corrections system should encompass the following aspects: diversion, day treatment, community programs, observation and assessment programs, probation services, secure facilities, aftercare, and assistance to counties for juvenile offenders not committed to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections.\n\n(2) The following is a brief description of what the legislature intends to become the components of Idaho’s juvenile corrections system:\n\n(a) Diversion. An alternative to formal prosecution of a juvenile offense. Diversions seek to hold a juvenile accountable for his actions through various interventions while redirecting youth away from formal processing in the juvenile justice system.\n\n(b) Probation. Probation officers have twenty-four (24) hour on-call responsibility for juvenile offenders and monitor their activities on a continual basis. Probation officers are responsible for assisting juvenile offenders and their families in accessing counseling or treatment resources, close supervision of juvenile offenders’ activities, supervision of restitution, and coordination of other services provided to juvenile offenders. Juvenile offenders ordered into the custody of the department of juvenile corrections would be monitored by a county probation officer.\n\n(c) Day treatment. Day treatment programs are time-limited nonresidential treatment and educational programs. Included in these programs may be trackers who provide intensive supervision of juvenile offenders through daily contact and by counseling juvenile offenders regarding employment, education, courts, family, and life skills. Nonresidential alcohol and drug programs provide outpatient assessment and counseling for juvenile offenders with substance abuse problems.\n\n(d) Community programs. It is intended that community programs will exist throughout the state to provide residential supervision and treatment options to juvenile offenders in close proximity to their families and their community. It is intended that these programs will strengthen the juvenile offender’s relationship with family, engender a commitment to school and employment, promote the development of competency and life skills, and help juvenile offenders generalize appropriate behavior into their environment.\n\n(e) Observation and assessment. Regional observation and assessment centers are provided, either directly or on a contract basis, to conduct observation and assessment of the juvenile offender in a short-term residential experience. It is intended that these programs would maintain standardized home and daily routines with intensive daily programming.\n\n(f) Secure facilities. Secure facilities provide secure confinement, discipline, education and treatment of the most seriously delinquent juvenile offenders. Programs at the secure facilities are designed to help juvenile offenders recognize accountability for delinquent behavior by confronting and eliminating delinquent norms, criminal thinking, and antisocial behavior and by making restitution to victims through community service or other restitution programs.\n\n(3) It is the further intent of the legislature that the primary purpose of this act is to provide a continuum of programs that emphasize the juvenile offender’s accountability for his actions while assisting him in the development of skills necessary to function effectively and positively in the community in a manner consistent with public safety. These services and programs will individualize treatment and control of the juvenile offender for the benefit of the juvenile offender and the protection of society. It is legislative intent that the department of juvenile corrections be operated within the framework of the following principles to accomplish this mission:\n\n(a) Provide humane, disciplined confinement to a juvenile offender who presents a danger to the community.\n\n(b) Strengthen opportunities for the juvenile offender’s development of competency and life skills by expanding the juvenile offender’s access to applicable programs and community resources.\n\n(c) Hold juvenile offenders accountable for their delinquent behavior through such means as victim restitution, community service programs and the sharing of correctional costs.\n\n(d) Invoke the participation of the juvenile offender’s parent or legal guardian in assisting the juvenile offender to recognize and accept responsibility for his delinquent or other antisocial behavior and hold the parent accountable, where appropriate, through the payment of detention costs and restitution to victims and through attendance at programs for the development of positive parenting skills designed to promote a functional relationship between the juvenile offender and his family.\n\n(e) Develop efficient and effective juvenile correctional programs within the framework of professional correctional standards, legislative intent and available resources.\n\n(f) Provide for a diversity of innovative and effective programs through research on delinquent behavior and the continuous evaluation of correctional programs. Innovative and effective programs should be evidence-based, as demonstrated through empirical research.\n\n(g) Assist counties in developing meaningful programs for juvenile offenders who have come into the juvenile corrections system but who have not been committed to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections.\n\n(h) Provide programs to increase public awareness of the mission of the juvenile corrections system and to encourage public participation in developing an effective juvenile corrections system designed to aid in reducing juvenile crime in this state.\n\n(i) Develop and maintain a statewide juvenile offender information system.\n\n[(20-501), added 1963, ch. 319, sec. 1, p. 876; am. 1984, ch. 81, sec. 2, p. 149; am. 1989, ch. 155, sec. 1, p. 372; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 44, sec. 2, p. 68; am. 2012, ch. 19, sec. 1, p. 39; am. 2012, ch. 257, sec. 5, p. 710; am. 2021, ch. 18, sec. 1, p. 41.]",

Service of the notice shall be made in the manner prescribed for service of a summons under section 20-512, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) The hearing upon the motion to waive jurisdiction shall be held in the same manner as an evidentiary hearing upon the original petition and shall be made part of the record.\n\n(6) If as a result of the hearing on the motion to waive jurisdiction the court shall determine that jurisdiction should not be waived, the petition shall be processed in the customary manner as a juvenile corrections act proceeding. However, in the event the court determines, as a result of the hearing, that juvenile corrections act jurisdiction should be waived and the juvenile should be prosecuted under the criminal laws of the state of Idaho, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it bases such decision together with a decree waiving juvenile corrections act jurisdiction and binding the juvenile over to the authorities for prosecution under the criminal laws of the state of Idaho.\n\n(7) No motion to waive juvenile corrections act jurisdiction shall be recognized, considered, or heard by the court in the same case once the court has entered an order or decree in that case that said juvenile has come within the purview of the juvenile corrections act, and all subsequent proceedings after the decree finding the juvenile within the purview of the act must be under and pursuant to the act and not as a criminal proceeding.\n\n(8) In considering whether or not to waive juvenile court jurisdiction over the juvenile, the juvenile court shall consider the following factors:\n\n(a) The seriousness of the offense and whether the protection of the community requires isolation of the juvenile beyond that afforded by juvenile facilities;\n\n(b) Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner;\n\n(c) Whether the alleged offense was against persons or property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons;\n\n(d) The maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of his home, environment, emotional attitude, and pattern of living;\n\n(e) The juvenile’s record and previous history of contacts with the juvenile corrections system;\n\n(f) The likelihood that the juvenile will develop competency and life skills to become a contributing member of the community by use of facilities and resources available to the court;\n\n(g) The amount of weight to be given to each of the factors listed in subsection (8) of this section is discretionary with the court, and a determination that the juvenile is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law may be based on any one (1) or a combination of the factors set forth within this section, which shall be recited in the order of waiver.\n\n(9) If the court does not waive jurisdiction and order a juvenile or adult held for criminal proceedings, the court in a county other than the juvenile’s or adult’s home county, after entering a decree that the juvenile or adult is within the purview of this chapter, may certify the case for sentencing to the court of the county in which the juvenile offender or adult resides upon being notified that the receiving court is willing to accept transfer. In the event of a transfer, which should be made unless the court finds it contrary to the interest of the juvenile offender or adult, the jurisdiction of the receiving court shall attach to the same extent as if the court had original jurisdiction.\n\n(10) Upon conviction of a juvenile offender held for adult criminal proceedings under this section, the sentencing judge may, if a finding is made that adult sentencing measures would be inappropriate:\n\n(a) Sentence the convicted person in accordance with the juvenile sentencing options set forth in this chapter; or\n\n(b) Sentence the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction but suspend the sentence and retain jurisdiction pursuant to section 19-2601A, Idaho Code, and commit the defendant to the dual custody of the department of juvenile corrections and the state board of correction.\n\n[(20-508, added 1977, ch. 165, sec. 2, p. 427; am. 1981, ch. 162, sec. 1, p. 284; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 44, sec. 9, p. 77; am. 1995, ch. 47, sec. 1, p. 111; am. 1995, ch. 277, sec. 4, p. 930; am. 1997, ch. 82, sec. 1, p. 192; am. 1999, ch. 390, sec. 1, p. 1086; am. 2000, ch. 246, sec. 2, p. 688; am. 2007, ch. 308, sec. 2, p. 865; am. 2010, ch. 235, sec. 9, p. 549; am. 2012, ch. 19, sec. 8, p. 45; am. 2015, ch. 113, sec. 6, p. 288.]",

Said individual or agency shall be responsible for providing the evidence to support the allegations made in the petition, provided this in no way shall relieve peace officers from enforcement of the law as set forth in section 31-2227, Idaho Code. The court may make a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the interests of the public or of the juvenile require that further action be taken. Such inquiry may be made through the county probation officer or such other agent or investigation officer designated by the court. Thereupon, the court may make such informal adjustment as is practicable, or dismiss the petition, or set the matter for hearing. If an informal adjustment is made, it shall provide for full or partial restitution in the manner and form prescribed by the court when the offense involves loss or damage of property of another.

When it appears to the court that the juvenile or his parents or guardian desire counsel but are financially unable to pay for such legal services, the court shall appoint counsel to represent the juvenile and his parents or guardian; provided that in the event the court shall find that there is a conflict of interest between the interests of the juvenile and his parents or guardian, then the court shall appoint separate counsel for the juvenile, whether or not he or his parents or guardian are able to afford counsel, unless there is an intelligent waiver of the right of counsel by the juvenile, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, and the court further determines that the best interest of the juvenile does not require the appointment of counsel. Counsel appointed under this section shall initially receive reasonable compensation from the county and the county shall have the right to be reimbursed for the cost thereof by the parents or guardian as hereafter provided in this section.\n\n(5) Any waiver of the right to counsel by a juvenile under this act shall be made in writing, on the record and upon a finding by the court that:\n\n(a) The juvenile has been informed of the right to counsel and the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation; and\n\n(b) The waiver is intelligently made after consideration of the totality of the circumstances including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) The age, maturity, intelligence, education, competency and comprehension of the juvenile;\n\n(ii) The presence of the juvenile’s parents or guardian;\n\n(iii) The seriousness of the offense;\n\n(iv) The collateral consequences of adjudication of the offense; and\n\n(v) Whether the interests of the juvenile and his parents or guardian conflict.\n\n(6) A juvenile shall not be permitted to waive the assistance to counsel in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) If the juvenile is under the age of fourteen (14) years;\n\n(b) In sentencing proceedings in which it has been recommended that the juvenile be committed to the legal custody of the department of juvenile corrections;\n\n(c) In proceedings in which the juvenile is being adjudicated for commission of a crime of a sexual nature;\n\n(d) In proceedings in which the juvenile is being adjudicated for commission of a felony;\n\n(e) In hearings upon a motion to waive jurisdiction under the juvenile corrections act pursuant to section 20-508, Idaho Code;\n\n(f) In hearings upon a motion to examine the juvenile to determine if he is competent to proceed pursuant to section 20-519A, Idaho Code; or\n\n(g) In recommitment proceedings.\n\n(7) Upon the entry of an order finding the juvenile is within the purview of this act, the parents, spouse or other person liable for the support of the juvenile, or the estates of such persons, and the estate of such juvenile, may be required by the court to reimburse the county for all or a portion of the cost of those legal services rendered to the juvenile by counsel appointed pursuant to this section that are related to the finding that the juvenile is within the purview of this act, unless the court finds such persons or estate to be indigent as described in section 19-6011, Idaho Code, and the requirement would impose a manifest hardship on those persons responsible for the juvenile or the estates. The current inability of those persons or entities to pay the reimbursement shall not, in and of itself, restrict the court from ordering reimbursement.\n\n(8) The prosecuting attorney of each county may, on behalf of the county, recover payment or reimbursement, as the case may be, from each person or estate who is liable for the payment or reimbursement of the cost of court appointed counsel for the juvenile, as provided in subsection (7) of this section. In the event such payment or reimbursement is not made upon demand by the prosecuting attorney, suit may be brought against such persons by the prosecuting attorney within five (5) years after the date on which such counsel was appointed by the court.\n\n[(20-514) 1976, ch. 246, sec. 2, p. 846; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 44, sec. 15, p. 82; am. 2013, ch. 222, sec. 2, p. 522; am. 2023, ch. 220, sec. 36, p. 682.]",

(1) A peace officer may take a juvenile into custody, or a private citizen may detain a juvenile until the juvenile can be delivered forthwith into the custody of a peace officer, without order of the court:\n\n(a) When he has reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an act that would be a misdemeanor or felony if committed by an adult; or\n\n(b) When in the presence of a peace officer or private citizen the juvenile has violated any local, state or federal law or municipal ordinance; or\n\n(c) When there are reasonable grounds to believe the juvenile has committed a status offense. Status offenses are truancy, running away from or being beyond the control of parents, guardian, or legal custodian, alcohol age violations under section 18-1502(e), Idaho Code, and curfew violations. Status offenders shall not be placed in any jail facility, including juvenile detention centers, but instead may be placed in juvenile shelter care facilities, except in the case of runaways, when there is a specific detention request from a foreign jurisdiction to hold the juvenile pending transportation arrangements, and a peace officer may, in his discretion, notify the parent, guardian or legal custodian. In the event of an alcohol age infraction under section 18-1502(e), Idaho Code, the status offense under this section shall be in addition to the infraction.\n\n(2) A peace officer may take a juvenile into custody upon a written order or warrant signed by a judge. The judge may issue the order or warrant after finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile comes within the purview of this chapter. Such taking into custody shall not be deemed an arrest. Jurisdiction of the court shall attach from the time the juvenile is taken into custody. When an officer takes a juvenile into custody, he shall notify the parent, guardian or custodian of the juvenile as soon as possible. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, or unless it appears to the officer taking the juvenile into custody that it is contrary to the welfare of society or the juvenile, such juvenile shall be released to the custody of his parent or other responsible adult upon written promise, signed by such person, to bring the juvenile to the court at a stated time. Such written promise shall be submitted to the court as soon as possible. If such person fails to produce the juvenile as agreed, or upon notice from the court, a summons for such person may be issued by the court and a warrant may be issued for apprehension of the juvenile.\n\n(3) A juvenile taken into custody may be fingerprinted and photographed. Any fingerprints and photographs taken shall be forwarded as provided in subsection (8) of this section. If the court finds good cause, it may order any fingerprints and photographs expunged.\n\n(4) When a juvenile is not released, he shall be taken forthwith to the court or place of detention specified by the court. The juvenile shall, not later than twenty-four (24) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, be brought before the court for a detention hearing to determine where the juvenile will be placed until the next hearing. Status offenders shall not be placed in any jail facility, including juvenile detention centers, but instead may be placed in juvenile shelter care facilities.\n\nPlacements may include but are not limited to the following:\n\n(a) Parents of the juvenile;\n\n(b) Relatives of the juvenile;\n\n(c) Foster care;\n\n(d) Group care;\n\n(e) A juvenile detention center, except in the case of a status offender; or\n\n(f) Diversion programs.\n\n(5) The person in charge of a detention center shall give immediate notice to the court that the juvenile is in his custody.\n\n(6) No juvenile shall be held in detention longer than twenty-four (24) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, unless a petition has been filed and the court has signed the detention order.\n\n(7) As soon as a juvenile is detained by court order, his parents, guardian or legal custodian shall be informed by notice in writing on forms prescribed by the court that they may have a prompt hearing regarding release or detention.\n\n(8) A juvenile taken into detention for an offense shall be fingerprinted and photographed. Fingerprints and photographs taken of juveniles shall be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency and filed with the bureau of criminal identification of the Idaho state police, which shall create a juvenile offender fingerprint file and enter the fingerprint data into the automated fingerprint identification system. If the court finds good cause, it may order the fingerprints and photographs of the juvenile offender expunged.\n\n(9) Peace officers’ records of juveniles shall be kept separate from records of adults and shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code.\n\n[(20-516) 16-1811, 1963, ch. 319, sec. 11, p. 876; am. 1977, ch. 156, sec. 2, p. 400; am. 1982, ch. 126, sec. 1, p. 362; am. 1984, ch. 81, sec. 8, p. 152; am. 1990, ch. 213, sec. 11, p. 497; am. and redesig. 1995, ch. 44, sec. 17, p. 83; am. 1995, ch. 49, sec. 1, p. 115; am. 1995, ch. 277, sec. 5, p. 932; am. 1996, ch. 259, sec. 1, p. 854; am. 1996, ch. 379, sec. 2, p. 1285; am. 2000, ch. 469, sec. 54, p. 1505; am. 2012, ch. 19, sec. 13, p. 51; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 25, p. 405; am. 2016, ch. 344, sec. 3, p. 988; am. 2021, ch. 19, sec. 1, p. 46.]",

The juvenile pretrial supervision fee shall be paid to the clerk of the district court who shall deposit such fee into the county juvenile probation fund, which is hereby created, in each county or, at the option of the board of county commissioners, deposited in the county justice fund to be used for county juvenile probation services.

The request shall state the facts in support of the request for a competency examination. If, based upon the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the court determines that there is good cause to believe that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, then the court shall stay all proceedings and appoint at least one (1) examiner who shall be a qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within two (2) business days, at least one (1) examiner who shall be a qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, to examine and report upon the mental condition of the juvenile.

The court may, upon a finding of good cause, vacate or continue the ninety (90) day restoration review hearing set forth in section 20-519C, Idaho Code.\n\n(8) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the juvenile.\n\n(9) If the examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the juvenile to participate, the report shall so state and shall include, if possible, an opinion as to whether such unwillingness of the juvenile was the result of age, mental disease, defect or disability and whether the examiner recommends that a second examiner be appointed to examine the juvenile.\n\n[20-519A, added 2011, ch. 178, sec. 1, p. 505.]",

In considering whether the juvenile is competent to proceed, the court shall consider the following:\n\n(a) A description of the nature, content, extent and results of the examination and any test that was conducted;\n\n(b) The juvenile’s capacity to understand the charges or allegations against the juvenile;\n\n(c) The juvenile’s capacity to understand the range and nature of possible penalties that may be imposed in the proceedings;\n\n(d) The juvenile’s capacity to understand the adversarial nature of the legal process;\n\n(e) The juvenile’s capacity to disclose to counsel facts pertinent to the proceedings at issue;\n\n(f) Whether the juvenile is able to display appropriate courtroom behavior;\n\n(g) Whether the juvenile is able to receive accurate impressions of the facts about which he or she is examined, is able to appreciate the meaning of an oath to tell the truth and has an understanding of the potential consequences of not telling the truth;\n\n(h) The examiner’s opinion as to the competency of the juvenile as defined in subsection (2) of section 20-519A, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) The weight to be given to each of the factors listed in subsection (1) of this section is discretionary with the court and a determination that the juvenile is or is not competent to proceed may be based on any one (1) or a combination of such factors, which shall be recited in the court’s order regarding competency.\n\n(3) If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the juvenile contests the findings of the report of the examiner or evaluation committee, the court may make the determination on the basis of such report. If a party contests the findings of such report, they shall have the right to cross-examine the qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who prepared and submitted the report and to offer evidence upon this issue. A finding of incompetency shall be based upon a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(4) If the court finds the juvenile is competent to proceed, the proceedings shall continue without delay.\n\n(5) If the court initially finds that the juvenile is incompetent and there is not a substantial probability that the juvenile will be restored to competency within six (6) months, the court may stay or dismiss the matter. In determining whether to stay or dismiss the matter, the court shall consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the seriousness of the alleged offense, resources available to the juvenile and any issues of public safety. Prior to a stay or dismissal of the matter, the court may convene a screening team consisting of representatives from the department of health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, and/or other agencies or persons designated by the court to develop a treatment plan for the juvenile. In developing such treatment plan, the recommendations contained in the competency examination shall be considered to ensure necessary services for the juvenile are put into place. Parents and guardians of the juvenile, if available, shall be included in the screening team and consulted with regard to the plan of treatment. If appropriate, the court may hold a hearing to determine whether proceedings under chapter 24, title 16, or chapter 3 or 4, title 66, Idaho Code, should be instituted. If such proceedings are initiated, the juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over said proceedings.\n\n(6) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, but may be restored to competency within six (6) months, the court shall order a plan of treatment to be developed by the department of health and welfare for the juvenile to undergo efforts at restoration to competency. The court may:\n\n(a) Convene a restoration treatment team to make recommendations on a plan of treatment;\n\n(b) Order any agencies that have treated or had custody of the juvenile to release any pertinent information or records to the department of health and welfare to be used in the development and implementation of the juvenile’s restoration plan;\n\n(c) Order the department of health and welfare, county probation, school officials and the department of juvenile corrections to release all pertinent information regarding the juvenile to the court, the department of health and welfare and any restoration treatment team to be used in the development and implementation of the juvenile’s restoration plan;\n\n(d) Require the parents or guardians of the juvenile, and where appropriate require the juvenile, to allow information pertinent to the restoration treatment plan be released to the department of health and welfare, the court and any restoration treatment team.\n\n(7) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed, but may be restored to competency, the court may order a juvenile to participate in the competency restoration program as developed by the department of health and welfare. The purpose of the treatment or training is the restoration of the juvenile’s competency to proceed. In determining the type and location of the competency restoration program and in designating a restoration provider, the department of health and welfare shall identify the least restrictive alternative that is consistent with public safety and consider whether inpatient treatment, residential care or secure confinement is necessary for program participation.\n\n(a) An inpatient or residential or secure detention facility is only appropriate if all available less restrictive alternatives in community settings which would offer an opportunity for improvement of the juvenile’s condition are inappropriate. If the department of health and welfare’s plan of restoration requires the juvenile be placed in an inpatient, residential or secure detention facility, the court shall hold a hearing on whether to order such placement unless the hearing is waived by the juvenile and the juvenile’s parents or guardians. Juveniles charged with only a status offense or multiple status offenses shall not be held in a secure confinement or detention facility for restoration purposes.\n\n(b) The department of health and welfare is responsible for determining the competency restoration program and services. All costs associated with restoration services shall be the responsibility of the parents of the juvenile according to their ability to pay pursuant to section 39-3140, Idaho Code. The financial obligation of the parents shall be determined after consideration of all available payment and funding sources including title XIX of the social security act, as amended, all available third party sources including funding available to the juvenile from other programs, grants or agencies and parent resources according to any order for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services shall not be conditioned upon transfer of custody of parental rights.\n\n(8) If a juvenile is determined to be incompetent to proceed but may be restored to competency, the court shall retain jurisdiction of the juvenile for up to six (6) months. A restoration order issued pursuant to this section is valid for six (6) months from the date of the initial finding of incompetency or until one (1) of the following, whichever occurs first:\n\n(a) The restoration program submits a report that the juvenile has become competent to proceed or that there is no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is valid;\n\n(b) The charges are dismissed; or\n\n(c) The juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age.\n\n(9) The court may extend the restoration order beyond six (6) months upon a showing of good cause. If the juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age, the matter shall be dismissed. If the court concludes that there is no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is valid, then the provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply.\n\n[20-519B, added 2011, ch. 178, sec. 2, p. 507; am. 2025, ch. 110, sec. 19, p. 588.]",

      "text": "20-520. SENTENCING. (1) Upon the entry of an order finding the juvenile offender is within the purview of the act, the court shall then hold a sentencing hearing in the manner prescribed by the Idaho juvenile rules to determine the sentence that will promote accountability, competency development and community protection. Prior to the entry of an order disposing of the case, other than an order of discharge or dismissal, the court may request and, if requested, shall receive a report containing the results of an inquiry into the home environment, past history, competency development, prevention or out-of-home placement services provided, and the social, physical and mental condition of the juvenile offender. The report shall be compiled using tools that screen for human trafficking, risks and needs of the juvenile offender, and any trauma suffered by the juvenile offender and shall include any additional screening deemed appropriate. The court shall not consider or review the report prior to the entry of an order of adjudication. Upon presentation and consideration of the report by the court, the court may proceed to sentence the juvenile offender as follows:\n\n(a) Place the juvenile offender on an informal adjustment of the petition for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date of the order.\n\n(i) Informal adjustments may be ordered for any case filed under this chapter, upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem just and appropriate under the circumstances, and not be limited by the nature of the charge. Informal adjustments may include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Reprimand of the juvenile offender;\n\n2. Supervision with the probation department;\n\n3. Community service work; and\n\n4. Restitution to the victim.\n\n(ii) The court shall dismiss the case if:\n\n1. An informal adjustment has been granted and the juvenile offender has satisfied the terms or conditions of the informal adjustment;\n\n2. The court is convinced by the showing made that there is no longer cause for continuing the period of informal adjustment; and\n\n3. It is compatible with the public interest.\n\n(iii) If the court, after hearing and notice, finds that a juvenile has violated the informal adjustment, the court may impose any sentence available to the court pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(b) Place the juvenile offender on formal probation for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date of the order, except the court may place a juvenile offender on formal probation for a period not to exceed the juvenile offender’s twenty-first birthday if the court finds that the juvenile offender has committed a crime of a sexual nature. If a juvenile offender is committed to the Idaho department of juvenile corrections pursuant to paragraph (t) of this subsection, the court may place the juvenile offender on probation from the date of sentencing up to three (3) years past the date of release from custody or the juvenile offender’s twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs first; provided the court shall conduct a review hearing within thirty (30) days following release of the juvenile offender from the department of juvenile corrections in order to determine the conditions and term of such probation;\n\n(c) Sentence the juvenile offender to detention pursuant to this act for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days for each act, omission, or status that is prohibited by the federal, state, local, or municipal law or ordinance by reason of minority only. The sentence shall not be executed unless the act, omission, or status is in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(x) or the court finds that the juvenile offender has violated the court’s decree imposing the sentence as provided in this subsection. If the court, after notice and hearing, finds that a juvenile offender has violated the court’s decree imposing the sentence under circumstances that bring the violation under the valid court order exception of the federal juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1974, as amended, the court may commit the juvenile offender to detention for the period of detention previously imposed at sentencing;\n\n(d) Commit the juvenile offender to a period of detention, pursuant to this act, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days for each unlawful or criminal act the juvenile offender is found to have committed or if the unlawful or criminal act would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult;\n\n(e) If the juvenile offender has committed an unlawful or criminal act that would be a felony if committed by an adult, the court may commit the juvenile offender to detention for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days for each unlawful or criminal act;\n\n(f) Whenever a court commits a juvenile offender to a period of detention, the juvenile detention center shall notify the school district where the detention center is located. No juvenile offender who is found to come within the purview of the act for the commission of a status offense shall be sentenced to detention in a jail facility;\n\n(g) Commit the juvenile offender to detention and suspend the sentence on specific probationary conditions;\n\n(h) The court may suspend or restrict the juvenile offender’s driving privileges for such periods of time as the court deems necessary, and the court may take possession of the juvenile offender’s driver’s license. The juvenile offender may request restricted driving privileges during a period of suspension, which the court may allow if the juvenile offender shows by a preponderance of evidence that driving privileges are necessary for his employment or for family health needs;\n\n(i) The court may order that the juvenile offender be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon, psychiatrist, or psychologist or that he receive other special care or that he submit to an alcohol or drug evaluation, if needed, and for such purposes may place the juvenile offender in a hospital or other suitable facility;\n\n(j) The court may order that the county probation office authorize a comprehensive substance abuse assessment of the juvenile offender. After receiving the comprehensive substance abuse assessment, and upon a finding by the court that treatment will provide a cost-effective means of achieving the sentencing goals of accountability, competency development and community protection, the court may order that the juvenile offender receive immediate treatment for substance abuse in keeping with a plan of treatment approved by the court. The initial cost of the assessment and treatment shall be borne by the department of juvenile corrections with funds allocated to the county probation office. The director of the department of juvenile corrections may promulgate rules consistent with this paragraph to establish a schedule of fees to be charged to parents by the county probation office for such services based upon the cost of the services and the ability of parents to pay;\n\n(k) In support of an order under the provisions of this section, the court may make an additional order setting forth reasonable conditions to be complied with by the parents, the juvenile offender, his legal guardian or custodian, or any other person who has been made a party to the proceedings, including, but not limited to, restrictions on visitation by the parents or one (1) parent, restrictions on the juvenile offender’s associates, occupation and other activities, and requirements to be observed by the parents, guardian or custodian;\n\n(l) The court may make any other reasonable order that is in the best interest of the juvenile offender or is required for the protection of the public, except that no person under the age of eighteen (18) years may be committed to jail, prison or a secure facility that does not meet the standards set forth in section 20-518, Idaho Code, unless jurisdiction over the individual is in the process of being waived or has been waived pursuant to section 20-508 or 20-509, Idaho Code. The court may combine several of the above-listed modes of disposition where they are compatible;\n\n(m) An order under the provisions of this section for probation or placement of a juvenile offender with an individual or an agency may provide a schedule for review of the case by the court;\n\n(n) Order the proceeding expanded or altered to include consideration of the cause pursuant to chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code;\n\n(o) Order the case and all documents and records connected therewith transferred to the magistrate division of the district court for the county where the juvenile offender and/or parents reside if different than the county where the juvenile offender was charged and found to have committed the unlawful or criminal act, for the entry of a dispositional order;\n\n(p) Order such other terms, conditions, care or treatment as appear to the court will best serve the interests of the juvenile offender and the community;\n\n(q) The court shall assess a twenty-dollar ($20.00) detention/probation training academy fee against the juvenile offender for every petition filed where there has been an adjudication that the juvenile offender is within the purview of this chapter. All moneys raised pursuant to this paragraph shall be transmitted by the court for deposit in the juvenile corrections fund, which is created in section 20-542, Idaho Code;\n\n(r) Additionally, the court shall assess a fee of sixty cents (60¢) per hour of community service against the juvenile offender for every petition filed where there has been an adjudication that the juvenile offender is within the purview of this chapter and the court is ordering community service. Such fee is to be remitted by the court to the state insurance fund for purposes of providing worker’s compensation insurance for persons performing community service pursuant to this chapter. However, if a county is self-insured and provides worker’s compensation insurance for persons performing community service pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, then remittance to the state insurance fund is not required;\n\n(s) Additionally, the court may assess a monthly probation supervision fee that shall be an amount not more than the maximum monthly misdemeanor probation supervision fee set forth in section 31-3201D, Idaho Code, per month, or such lesser sum as determined by the administrative judge of the judicial district, against the juvenile offender placed on probation. The amount of the monthly probation supervision fee shall be paid to the clerk of the district court who shall deposit such fee into the county juvenile probation fund, which is hereby created, in each county or, at the option of the board of county commissioners, deposited in the county justice fund to be used for county juvenile probation services. Moneys from this fee may be accumulated from year to year and shall be expended exclusively for county juvenile probation services and related purposes;\n\n(t) Commit the juvenile offender to the legal custody of the department of juvenile corrections for an indeterminate period of time, not to exceed the juvenile offender’s nineteenth birthday, unless the custody review board determines that extended time in custody is necessary to address competency development, accountability, and community protection; provided however, that no juvenile offender shall remain in the custody of the department beyond the juvenile offender’s twenty-first birthday. The department shall adopt rules implementing the custody review board and operations and procedures of such board. Juvenile offenders convicted as adults and placed in the dual custody of the department of juvenile corrections and the state board of correction under section 19-2601A, Idaho Code, are under the retained jurisdiction of the court and are not within the purview of the custody review board;\n\n(u) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a court may not commit a juvenile offender under the age of ten (10) years to a period of detention or to the custody of the department of juvenile corrections for placement in secure confinement.\n\n(2) When an order is entered pursuant to this section, the juvenile offender shall be transported to the facility or program so designated by the court or the department, as applicable, by the sheriff of the county where the juvenile offender resides or is committed, or by an appointed agent. When committing a juvenile offender to the department, or another entity, the court shall at once forward to the department or entity a certified copy of the order of commitment.\n\n(3) Unless the court determines that an order of restitution would be inappropriate or undesirable, it shall order the juvenile offender or his parents or both to pay restitution to or make whole any victim who suffers an economic loss as a result of the juvenile offender’s conduct in accordance with the standards and requirements of sections 19-5304 and 19-5305, Idaho Code. The amount of restitution that may be ordered by the court shall not be subject to the limitations of section 6-210, Idaho Code. Court-ordered restitution shall be paid prior to any other court-ordered payments unless the court specifically orders otherwise. The clerk of the district court, with the approval of the administrative district judge, may use the procedures set forth in section 19-4708, Idaho Code, for the collection of the restitution.\n\n(4) The court may order the juvenile offender’s parents or custodian to pay the charges imposed by community programs ordered by the court for the juvenile offender, or the juvenile offender’s parents or custodian.\n\n(5) Any parent, legal guardian or custodian violating any order of the court entered against the person under the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to contempt proceedings under the provisions of chapter 6, title 7, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) The clerk of the district court, with the approval of the administrative district judge, may use the procedures set forth in section 19-4708, Idaho Code, for the collection of other debts owed to the court by the juvenile offender.\n\n[20-520, added 1996, ch. 301, sec. 2, p. 989; am. 1996, ch. 301, sec. 3, p. 992; am. 1996, ch. 359, sec. 2, p. 1209; am. 1997, ch. 76, sec. 1, p. 158; am. 1997, ch. 262, sec. 1, p. 747; am. 1999, ch. 155, sec. 1, p. 431; am. 2000, ch. 329, sec. 1, p. 1106; am. 2000, ch. 466, sec. 1, p. 1444; am. 2001, ch. 15, sec. 1, p. 17; am. 2002, ch. 73, sec. 1, p. 160; am. 2002, ch. 97, sec. 1, p. 265; am. 2002, ch. 309, sec. 1, p. 880; am. 2007, ch. 308, sec. 1, p. 862; am. 2008, ch. 41, sec. 1, p. 96; am. 2009, ch. 102, sec. 3, p. 313; am. 2009, ch. 154, sec. 2, p. 449; am. 2012, ch. 19, sec. 16, p. 54; am. 2012, ch. 257, sec. 6, p. 712; am. 2015, ch. 87, sec. 1, p. 213; am. 2015, ch. 113, sec. 8, p. 291; am. 2019, ch. 219, sec. 2, p. 663; am. 2021, ch. 19, sec. 2, p. 48; am. 2022, ch. 20, sec. 2, p. 42; am. 2024, ch. 249, sec. 1, p. 881.]",

Whenever a juvenile offender is found to come under the purview of this chapter, the court shall have jurisdiction and authority to have the juvenile offender and the juvenile offender’s parent(s), legal guardian or custodian sign a probationary contract with the court containing terms and conditions that the juvenile offender and the juvenile offender’s parent(s), legal guardian or custodian must adhere to as a condition of the juvenile offender’s probation. The probationary contract may provide that upon a violation or breach of the terms and conditions of the probationary contract, the juvenile offender’s parent(s), legal guardian or custodian shall be liable to the court for a specific monetary sum not in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for the breach of contract. All such moneys shall be payable to the court and shall be in addition to any other fines, penalties or other sanctions provided by law.
