      "text": "20-301. COMPACTS WITH OTHER STATES AUTHORIZED. The governor of this state is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the state of Idaho with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nThe compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\n(1) \"Adult\" means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute or operation of law.\n\n(2) \"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the interstate commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling the interstate commission’s actions or conduct.\n\n(3) \"Compact administrator\" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact who is responsible for the administration and management of the state’s supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the interstate commission and policies adopted by the state council under this compact.\n\n(4) \"Compacting state\" means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\n(5) \"Commissioner\" means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to article III of this compact.\n\n(6) \"Interstate commission\" means the interstate commission for adult offender supervision established by this compact.\n\n(7) \"Member\" means the commissioner of a compacting state or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the commissioner.\n\n(8) \"Noncompacting state\" means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\n(9) \"Offender\" means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies.\n\n(10) \"Person\" means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private.\n\n(11) \"Rules\" means acts of the interstate commission, duly promulgated pursuant to article VIII of this compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the interstate commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states.\n\n(12) \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia and any other territorial possessions of the United States.\n\n(13) \"State council\" means the resident members of the state council for interstate adult offender supervision created by each state under article IV of this compact.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nTHE COMPACT COMMISSION\n\n(1) The compacting states hereby create the \"Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.\" The interstate commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.\n\n(3) The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same, nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\n(4) The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\n(1) Any state, as defined in article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\n(2) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five (35) of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in interstate commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\n(3) Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the interstate commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\n(1) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (\"withdrawing state\") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n(2) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof.\n\n(3) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n(4) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state’s reenactment of the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.\n\n(5) If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (\"defaulting state\") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\n(a) Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;\n\n(b) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;\n\n(c) Suspension and termination of membership in the compact.

Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council.\n\n(6) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.\n\n(7) Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the state council of such termination.\n\n(8) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(9) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(10) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.\n\n(11) The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(12) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n(1) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\n(2) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\n(1) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\n(2) All compacting states’ laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\n(3) All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\n(4) All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n(5) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\n(6) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\n[20-301, added 2000, ch. 413, sec. 2, p. 1307.]",
