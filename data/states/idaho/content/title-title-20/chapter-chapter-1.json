An inmate shall be placed on furlough only when there has been made:\n\n(1) an administrative verification of the reason for which the inmate requests furlough;\n\n(2) arrangements for supervision, maintenance and care while on furlough;\n\n(3) verification that travel arrangements directly to and from the place of destination, with all expenses paid by the inmate or his family; provided however, that in the case of an indigent inmate, said expenses may be satisfied from the inmate welfare fund;\n\n(4) a determination of the leave duration, provided, however, that such leave may not exceed seventy-two (72) hours except in the case of a medical furlough for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of a serious illness or injury;\n\n(5) provision for signing a waiver of extradition;\n\n(6) a determination and establishment in writing of any and all other conditions, terms and incidents requisite to such furlough;\n\n(7) there are no detainers against said inmate; and\n\n(8) said inmate has been classified to minimum custody for a minimum of six (6) months immediately prior to the granting of said furlough and has been recognized for meritorious performance by the board of correction or its delegated authority while so classified to minimum custody, except in the case of a medical furlough for diagnosis or treatment of a serious illness or injury.
