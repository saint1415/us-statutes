The board and the commission shall attempt to inform themselves as to such inmate as a personality and may seek from the sentencing judge, prosecuting attorney, defense counsel and law enforcement authorities such information of which they may be possessed relative to the convicted person and the crime for which he was committed. An electronic recording or transcript of the comments and arguments required to be recorded by section 19-2515, Idaho Code, shall be submitted to the board, made available to the commission, and shall be considered by the commission in making a parole or commutation decision with respect to the prisoner.\n\n(2) The board of correction shall use a validated risk assessment to determine, for each prisoner, the risk of reoffense and suitability for release. For purposes of this subsection, \"validated risk assessment\" means an actuarial tool that has been validated in Idaho to determine the likelihood of the prisoner engaging in future criminal behavior. The board shall select a research-based risk assessment and shall validate the accuracy of the risk assessment at least every five (5) years in consultation with the commission. Assessments shall be performed by department staff who are trained and certified in the use of the risk assessment. The commission shall promulgate rules in compliance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, to ensure that risk assessment is used in determining parole, the benefit of holding a prisoner in prison to complete programming versus releasing the prisoner on parole to complete programming in the community and in setting conditions for parole supervision.\n\n[20-224, added 1947, ch. 53, sec. 24, p. 59; am. 1980, ch. 297, sec. 7, p. 771; am. 1984, ch. 230, sec. 2, p. 551; am. 2014, ch. 150, sec. 13, p. 426.]",

(1) When a person is committed to the custody of the state board of correction, the board may, upon conditions which it may impose, direct that the person be permitted to continue in his regular employment, work project, or educational program, if that is compatible with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, or may authorize the person to secure employment for himself.\n\n(2) If the board directs that the prisoner be permitted to continue in his regular employment or education, the board shall arrange for a continuation of the employment or education so far as possible without interruption. If the prisoner does not have regular employment, and the board has authorized the prisoner to secure employment for himself, the prisoner may do so, and the board may assist him in doing so. A prisoner who secures employment with a private employer shall receive the same salary range offered to other similarly situated employees based on experience, education, and other qualifications. An employed prisoner shall have available to him all the benefits offered to other similarly situated employees, such as health care benefits, paid leave, flexible spending accounts, and life insurance. If an employed prisoner elects to participate in an optional benefit, he shall have the same financial responsibility as his coworkers to pay for insurance premiums and copayments for services received. Employed prisoners who elect private health insurance shall list the board as a secondary payer.\n\n(3) Whenever the prisoner is not employed and between the hours or periods of employment, work project, or schooling, he shall be domiciled in a jail, facility, or residence as directed by the board of correction.\n\n(4) The earnings of the prisoner shall be retained by the prisoner under such terms and conditions as the board may impose.
