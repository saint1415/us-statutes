But no maintenance or other assessments shall accrue against such land until such time as the land is actually sold. The term \"construction work\" as herein used shall include the erection of pump houses and electrical and other pumps or appliances for raising water to the lands, as well as dams, headgates, ditches, laterals, drainage canals and other irrigation works. These initial costs shall be assessed against purchasers of the land on such terms of payment as may be agreed upon between the state board of land commissioners and the directors of the irrigation district, and such terms shall be stated in the advertisement of such sale.
