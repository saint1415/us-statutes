Any person or persons owning land within any irrigation district and forming a part thereof may file with the board of directors of such irrigation district a petition in writing requesting the exclusion of the land or lands owned by them and described in the petition from the irrigation district. As many parties owning separate tracts or parcels of lands in any irrigation district or who are united in interest to which the same state of facts apply, may unite in the same petition. The petition shall be signed by all of the petitioners, but need not be acknowledged. A filing fee in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) for each parcel of land described in the petition shall accompany the filing of each petition, plus an exclusion fee in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each lot containing less than one (1) acre which is in a subdivision as defined in section 50-1301, Idaho Code, or an exclusion fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each parcel containing less than one (1) acre that is not in a subdivision, or an exclusion fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each acre and additional portion thereof in all other parcels of property, for which the district shall provide a suitable receipt evidencing payment. Any petition not accompanied by the required filing fee and exclusion fee shall be returned to the petitioner. The filing fee and the exclusion fee are borne by the petitioner and are not potentially apportionable costs as provided in sections 43-1105, 43-1106 and 43-1107, Idaho Code.\n\nA person or persons purchasing land under a written contract shall be deemed to be the owners of that land for purposes of this section.\n\n[43-1101, added 1905, p. 220, sec. 1; am.

(a) The grounds and reasons for exclusion of lands from an irrigation district are listed as follows:\n\n1. The lands are too high to be watered without pumping by the owners of the lands from water owned or controlled by the irrigation district;\n\n2. The owners of the lands have installed a good and sufficient water system independent of the water system of such irrigation district for the irrigation of the lands because the district does not own a sufficient water right to furnish an adequate water supply for those lands;\n\n3. The lands in their present condition are not agricultural lands and the irrigation district has not:\n\n(i) Adopted a resolution to construct a distribution system for the lands pursuant to section 43-333, Idaho Code; or\n\n(ii) Called an election on the question of constructing a distribution system for the lands under the provisions of section 43-329, Idaho Code; or\n\n(iii) Independently or in cooperation with a city or county established a local improvement district to construct a distribution system for the lands; or\n\n(iv) Constructed a distribution system for the lands; or\n\n4. Prior to acquisition of the land by the petitioning owner, and without his knowledge or consent, the ditch or other transmission facility extending from the delivery point of the district to the lands has been rendered permanently incapable of carrying water to the lands, but this ground for exclusion shall only apply to parcels less than five (5) acres in size.\n\n(b) If the lands sought to be excluded from an irrigation district under this section or under sections 43-1110 through 43-1117, Idaho Code, are benefited by surface drainage facilities of the irrigation district pursuant to sections 43-306 to 43-312, Idaho Code, but otherwise would qualify for exclusion, the lands shall be excluded for purposes of irrigation but shall remain a part of the district for purposes of drainage and shall continue to be assessable for drainage, but shall not be assessed for irrigation water.\n\n[(43-1102) I.C. sec. 43-1101A, as added by 1972, ch. 325, sec. 2, p. 804; am. 1978, ch. 312, sec. 2, p. 803; am. and redesignated, 1990, ch. 181, sec. 2, p. 388; am. 1993, ch. 262, sec. 1, p. 895.]",

A description of the land of each petitioner for which exclusion is requested;\n\n2. The reasons why it is claimed the tract or tracts should be excluded and that, except for residential lands for which exclusion is requested under subsection (a)3 or (a)4 of section 43-1102, Idaho Code, the lands sought to be excluded are not benefited by the water rights, or by the irrigation in, or drainage by the district, or by ground water subject to recapture and use by the district and the exclusion will be for the best interests (1) of the owner of the land proposed to be excluded and (2) of the other lands in the district.\n\n3. The petition shall be accompanied by such evidence of ownership of the land as is satisfactory to the board of directors of the district and, except for lands for which exclusion is requested under subsection (a)3 or (a)4 of section 43-1102, Idaho Code, by a deposit for costs in the amount established by the directors of the district as provided in section 43-1105, Idaho Code. The board of directors of the district shall return to the petitioner any petition not accompanied by both such proof of ownership and the filing and exclusion fees set by section 43-1101, Idaho Code, and no further action shall be required of the board with respect to such petition.\n\nA petition for exclusion filed with an irrigation district constitutes representations to the district by the petitioner or petitioners that the facts stated in the petition are true and correct and that no mortgagee or other person holds a lien of record in the county where the land for which exclusion is requested is located, for which the lienholder’s consent to the exclusion is required or that, if such consent is required, the consent has been granted by the lienholder.

The board of directors of the irrigation district may conduct its own investigation of the facts alleged in the petition and, by resolution duly adopted, which may address the allegations of several petitions, accept the facts as alleged and determine that no hearing is required prior to granting the petition or petitions for exclusion. If the allegations are not thus accepted such petition must be heard by the board of directors of such irrigation district within one hundred fifty (150) days of filing of the petition. If no hearing is held within one hundred fifty (150) days, the land described in the petition is excluded from the district.

Petitioners are, however, required to pay any outstanding assessments levied the calendar year and prior in which the petition is filed and said lien shall attach until said assessments are paid.\n\n[43-1104, added 1905, p. 220, sec. 3; am.
