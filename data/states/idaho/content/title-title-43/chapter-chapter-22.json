They shall be in coupon form but may be made registrable as to principal if so provided in the resolution authorizing their issuance. Such bonds shall be in denominations of one hundred dollars ($100) or a multiple thereof, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, payable annually or semiannually as the board shall elect, shall mature serially or otherwise at any time or times, shall be payable at such place or places within or without the state, may be made redeemable prior to maturity in such manner and at such premiums, shall be executed in such manner, and shall be sold in such manner and at such price or prices as may be determined by resolution of the board.\n\nBonds may be issued hereunder at one (1) time or from time to time. If more than one (1) issue or series of bonds is delivered hereunder the bonds of the respective issues or series shall have such priorities of payment as may be provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds.\n\nAny resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder shall provide for the creation of a sinking fund into which shall be paid from the revenues and assessments pledged to such payment in the authorizing resolution sums fully sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds and to create such reserve for contingencies as may be required by the resolution. Any resolution so authorizing bonds may contain such covenants with the future holders of the bonds as to the disposition of such revenues and assessments, the issuance of future bonds and the creation of future liens and encumbrances against the revenues and assessments and other pertinent matters deemed necessary or proper by the board to assure the merchantability of the bonds, provided such covenants and agreements are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\n\nAny resolution, or any contract with another irrigation district, may adopt the provisions of section 43-413, Idaho Code, with respect to the providing of a safety fund with respect to any assessments levied for the repayment of the bonds or the payment of any contract obligation.\n\nIt may be provided in any such resolution that any holder of the bonds or of any of the coupons thereto attached may by appropriate legal action compel performance of all duties required of the board and the officials of the district by the provisions of title 43, Idaho Code, and the provisions of the resolution authorizing the bonds. If any bond issued hereunder is permitted to go into default, as to principal or interest, any court of competent jurisdiction may, pursuant to the application of the holder of any bond, or if applicable the trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, appoint a receiver to collect and distribute the revenues and assessments pledged to the repayment of the bonds pursuant to the provisions and requirements of the resolution and of this act and as the court may direct.\n\nThe board of any district which shall have issued any bonds under the provisions of this chapter may authorize the issuance of bonds hereunder for the purpose of refunding all or any part of such outstanding bonds.

All such interim notes and the interest thereon may be secured by a pledge of the proceeds of the revenues and assessments provided in subsection (D) of section 43-2201, Idaho Code, and shall be payable solely from such revenues and assessments and from the proceeds to be derived from the sale of any bonds for permanent financing authorized to be issued pursuant to this chapter. Contemporaneously with the issue of the bonds as provided by this chapter, all interim notes, even though they may not have then matured, shall be paid, both principal and interest and applicable premium, if any, to date of payment, from the funds derived from the sale of bonds authorized hereunder for the permanent financing, and such interim notes shall thereupon be surrendered and canceled.\n\nThe resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds or interim notes hereunder shall, and any resolution authorizing the execution of any contract hereunder may, be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation in the district. For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such publication any person in interest may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to contest the regularity, formality or legality of the proceedings authorizing the bonds, the interim notes, the execution of such contract or the legality of such resolution and its provisions or of the contract or of the bonds or interim notes to be issued pursuant thereto and the provisions securing the bonds or interim notes. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period no one shall have any right of action to contest the validity of the contract or of the bonds or interim notes or of such proceedings or of such resolution or the validity of the pledges and covenants made in such proceedings and resolution and the contract and the bonds and interim notes and the provisions for their payment shall be conclusively presumed to be legal and no court shall thereafter have authority to inquire into such matters.\n\n[43-2202, as added by 1974, ch. 1, sec. 1, p. 3.]",

The description of precincts may be made by reference to any order or orders of the board of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the district or any part thereof is situated, or by reference to any previous order, or resolution of the board or by detailed description of such precincts. Precincts established by the boards of the various counties may be consolidated for special elections held hereunder. In the event any such election shall be called to be held concurrently with any other election or shall be consolidated therewith, the resolution calling the election hereunder need not designate precincts or polling places or the names of officers of election, but shall contain reference to the act or order calling such other election and fixing the precincts and polling places and appointing election officers therefrom.
