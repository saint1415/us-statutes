If the medium itself does not preclude alteration or deletion, the custodial state officer must insure that a document can be restored from a backup medium which may or may not be digital.\n\n(4) If a document is received as a data stream, it must be retained in a system which is secure against unauthorized or undetected alteration or deletion of data, and which provides for periodic backup of data for off-site storage. The system must permit the document to be readily and intelligibly reproduced on paper.\n\n(5) If a document is received in paper form or as an image of a paper document, and if the receiving state officer retains it in another form or medium as permitted in subsection (3) of this section, then the original of the document may be disposed of or returned to the sender, provided that such disposition or return is done pursuant to statute or an administrative rule promulgated under section 67-5751, Idaho Code.\n\n(6) A document retained by a state officer in any form or medium permitted under this section shall be deemed to be an original public record for all purposes. A reproduction or copy of such a document, certified by the state officer, shall be deemed to be a transcript or certified copy of the original, and shall be admissible before any court or administrative hearing.\n\n[9-328, added 1992, ch. 165, sec. 2, p. 529; am. 1997, ch. 74, sec. 1, p. 154.]",
