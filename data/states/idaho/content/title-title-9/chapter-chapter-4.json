Medical charts or records of hospitals licensed in this state may be proved as to foundation, identity and authenticity by use of a legible and durable copy, certified upon verification by an employee of the hospital charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof and empowered by said hospital to make such verified certifications. Said copy may be used in any proceeding in lieu of the original which, however, the hospital shall hold available during the pendency of the cause or proceeding for inspection and comparison by the court, tribunal or hearing officer and by the parties and their attorneys of record. A hospital wishing to avail itself of this section shall at any time prior to the time for proof of said charts and records, place on file with the clerk of the court or with the other body or agency conducting the proceeding a certified copy of a resolution of the governing board of such hospital, authorizing and identifying such employee.\n\n2. When a subpoena duces tecum is served upon any employee of such a hospital, and requires the production of any such medical charts or records at trial, deposition or any other proceeding, it is sufficient compliance therewith if a hospital employee charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof promptly notifies the party causing service of the subpoena, or his attorney of record, together with all other parties to the proceeding in which the subpoena was issued and of which parties he has reasonable notice, or their attorneys of record, of the hospital’s election to proceed under the provisions hereof and of the estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing such charts or records. Following such notification, the hospital employee charged with custodian responsibility for the original charts or records specified in the subpoena shall hold the same available at the hospital, and upon payment to the hospital of said estimated reproduction expenses shall promptly deliver, by mail or otherwise, a true, legible and durable copy of all medical charts or records specified in such subpoena, certified upon his verification, to the clerk of the court before which said proceeding is pending, or to the officer, body or tribunal before which said proceeding is pending if it be not before a court of this state. Such copies shall be delivered after being separately inclosed and sealed in an inner envelope or wrapper, with the title and number of the action, cause or proceeding, the name of such hospital, the name of the hospital employee making such certification and verification and the date of the subpoena clearly inscribed thereon, and the sealed envelope or wrapper shall then be inclosed and sealed in an outer envelope or wrapper, and delivered as aforesaid.\n\nIf the hospital has none of the charts or records specified in the subpoena, or only part thereof, an employee having custodial responsibility for original hospital charts or records shall so state in an affidavit and following notice and payment of expenses as hereinabove provided shall hold available such original charts or records as are in the hospital’s custody and specified in the subpoena and shall deliver copies thereof certified upon his verification together with said affidavit, in the manner hereinabove provided.\n\n3. The personal attendance of the hospital employee having custodial responsibility for the original charts or records specified in the subpoena is required if the subpoena contains a clause providing substantially as follows: \"The personal attendance of a hospital employee having custodial responsibility for the original charts or records specified herein is required by this subpoena. The procedure outlined in section 9-420, Idaho Code, shall not be sufficient compliance herewith.\" If the subpoena duces tecum requires the attendance of a hospital employee in the above manner, said requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the personal attendance of any hospital employee whose name has been lodged with the court or other body as provided in subsection 1 of this section. If personal attendance of a witness is required in the manner herein provided, the hospital may nevertheless elect to substitute true, legible and durable copies of the charts or records specified in the subpoena duces tecum by the giving of a notice of such election in the manner hereinabove set forth, in which case payment to the hospital of the actual and reasonable expenses of duplication of such charts or records by any party to the proceeding in which the subpoena was issued, or such party’s attorney of record, shall be a condition precedent to the personal attendance of any person pursuant to said subpoena, unless otherwise ordered by the court or other body before which said proceeding is pending.\n\n4. Any patient whose medical records or charts are thus copied and delivered, any person acting on his behalf, the hospital having custody of such records, or any physician, nurse or other person responsible for entries on such charts or records shall have standing to apply to the court or other body before which the cause or proceeding is pending for a protective order denying, restricting or otherwise limiting access and use of such copies or original charts and records. Such patients, persons, hospitals, physicians or nurses who are not parties to the cause or proceeding and who wish to apply for a protective order may petition to intervene in the cause or proceeding and simultaneously apply for such a protective order.\n\n[I.C., sec. 9-420, as added by 1971, ch. 47, sec. 2, p. 100.]",
