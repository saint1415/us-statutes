      "text": "74-102. PUBLIC RECORDS — RIGHT TO EXAMINE. (1) Every person has a right to examine and take a copy of any public record of this state and there is a presumption that all public records in Idaho are open at all reasonable times for inspection except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.\n\n(2) The right to copy public records shall include the right to make photographs or photographic or other copies while the records are in the possession of the custodian of the records using equipment provided by the public agency or using equipment designated by the custodian.\n\n(3) Additionally, the custodian of any public record shall give the person, on demand, a certified copy of it if the record is of a nature permitting such copying or shall furnish reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy such record.\n\n(4) A public agency may require that a request for public records be submitted to it in a writing that specifically describes the subject matter and records sought, including a specific date range for when the records sought were created. The requesting party shall be as specific as possible when requesting records. A request shall describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable the public body to locate such records with reasonable effort. A request shall also provide the requester’s name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and a written declaration by the requesting party attesting or affirming under oath whether such requester is a resident. A request for public records and delivery of the public records may be made by electronic mail.\n\n(5) The custodian shall make no inquiry of any person who requests a public record, except:\n\n(a) To verify the identity of the requester in accordance with section 74-113, Idaho Code; or\n\n(b) To ensure that the requested record or information will not be used for purposes of a mailing or telephone list prohibited by section 74-120, Idaho Code, or as otherwise provided by law; or\n\n(c) As required for purposes of protecting personal information from disclosure under chapter 2, title 49, Idaho Code, and federal law.\n\n(6) The custodian shall not review, examine or scrutinize any copy, photograph or memoranda in the possession of any such person and shall extend to the person all reasonable comfort and facility for the full exercise of the right granted under this act.\n\n(7) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the custodian from maintaining such vigilance as is required to prevent alteration of any public record while it is being examined.\n\n(8) Examination of public records under the authority of this section must be conducted during regular office or working hours unless the custodian shall authorize examination of records in other than regular office or working hours. In this event, the persons designated to represent the custodian during such examination shall be entitled to reasonable compensation to be paid to them by the public agency having custody of such records, out of funds provided in advance by the person examining such records, at other than regular office or working hours.\n\n(9) The public agency may provide the requester information to help the requester narrow the scope of the request or to help the requester make the request more specific when the response to the request is likely to be voluminous or require payment as provided in subsection (10) of this section.\n\n(10)(a) Except for fees that are authorized or prescribed under other provisions of Idaho law, no fee shall be charged for the first two (2) hours of labor in responding to a request submitted by a resident for public records, or for copying the first one hundred (100) pages of paper records that are requested by a resident.\n\n(b) A public agency or public official may establish fees to recover the actual labor and copying costs associated with locating and copying documents if:\n\n(i) The request is for more than one hundred (100) pages of paper records; or\n\n(ii) The request includes records from which nonpublic information must be deleted; or\n\n(iii) The actual labor associated with responding to requests for public records in compliance with the provisions of this chapter exceeds two (2) person hours.\n\n(c) A public agency or public official may establish separate copying fee schedules for requests submitted by residents and requests submitted by persons who are not residents. The fee for residents may not exceed the actual cost to the agency of copying the record if another fee is not otherwise provided by law.\n\n(d)(i) For providing a duplicate of a computer tape, computer disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing public record information, a public agency or public official may charge a fee, uniform to all residents, that does not exceed the sum of the following:\n\n1. The agency’s direct cost of copying the information in that form;\n\n2. The standard cost, if any, for selling the same information in the form of a publication;\n\n3. The agency’s cost of conversion, or the cost of conversion charged by a third party, if the existing electronic record is converted to another electronic form.\n\n(ii) A public agency or public official may charge additional fees, uniform to all persons who are not residents, for requests involving duplication of a computer tape, computer disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing public record information.\n\n(e) Fees for requests made by residents shall not exceed reasonable labor costs necessarily incurred in responding to a public records request, and if charged, shall reflect the personnel and quantity of time that are reasonably necessary to process a request. Fees for requests made by residents for labor costs shall be charged at the per hour pay rate of the lowest paid administrative staff employee or public official of the public agency who is necessary and qualified to process the request. If a request from a resident requires redactions to be made by an attorney who is employed by the public agency, the rate charged shall be no more than the per hour rate of the lowest paid attorney within the public agency who is necessary and qualified to process the public records request. If a request from a resident is submitted to a public agency that does not have an attorney on staff, and requires redactions by an attorney, the rate shall be no more than the usual and customary rate of the attorney who is retained by the public agency for that purpose.\n\n(f) The public agency shall not charge any cost or fee for copies or labor when the requester is a resident and demonstrates that the requester’s examination and/or copying of public records:\n\n(i) Is likely to contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of the operations or activities of the government;\n\n(ii) Is not primarily in the individual interest of the requester including, but not limited to, the requester’s interest in litigation in which the requester is or may become a party; and\n\n(iii) Will not occur if fees are charged because the requester has insufficient financial resources to pay such fees.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a public agency or public official may charge fees for labor and copying costs associated with locating and copying documents requested by a person who is not a resident or an employee of a resident. The fee rates and schedule for requests made by persons who are not residents or employees of residents shall be at the discretion of the public agency or public official as long as such fees do not exceed actual costs of the public agency or public official.\n\n(h) Statements of fees by a public agency shall be itemized to show the per page costs for copies, and hourly rates of employees and attorneys involved in responding to the request, and the actual time spent on the public records request. No lump sum costs shall be assigned to any public records request. If a separate fee schedule is adopted for requests from persons who are not residents or employees of residents, the separate fees for such nonresidents shall be separately identified.\n\n(11) A requester may not file multiple requests for public records solely to avoid payment of fees. When a public agency reasonably believes that one (1) or more requesters is segregating a request into a series of requests to avoid payment of fees authorized pursuant to this section, the public agency may aggregate such requests and charge the appropriate fees. The public agency may consider the time period in which the requests have been made in its determination to aggregate the related requests. A public agency shall not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one (1) requester.\n\n(12) The custodian may require advance payment of fees authorized by this section. Any money received by the public agency shall be credited to the account for which the expense being reimbursed was or will be charged, and such funds may be expended by the agency as part of its appropriation from that fund. Any portion of an advance payment in excess of the actual costs of labor and copying incurred by the agency in responding to the request shall be returned to the requester.\n\n(13) A public agency shall not prevent the examination or copying of a public record by contracting with a nongovernmental body to perform any of its duties or functions.\n\n(14) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from disclosing statistical information that is descriptive of an identifiable person or persons, unless prohibited by law.\n\n(15) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from providing a copy of a public record in electronic form if the record is available in electronic form and if the person specifically requests an electronic copy.\n\n(16) A public agency or elected official shall designate a custodian or custodians for all public records, which includes any public official having custody of, control of, or authorized access to public records and also includes all delegates of such officials, employees or representatives.\n\n[74-102, added 2015, ch. 140, sec. 5, p. 345; am. 2018, ch. 143, sec. 2, p. 291; am. 2020, ch. 338, sec. 2, p. 983; am. 2022, ch. 306, sec. 2, p. 973; am. 2025, ch. 298, sec. 2, p. 1247.]",

(1) All requests to examine public records shall be made to the designated custodian of such records as defined in section 74-101(3), Idaho Code. A public agency, a public official, or an employee of a public agency shall have no obligation and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation to respond to a public records request that fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection. A public records request must clearly indicate that it is a public records request.\n\n(2) A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a resident’s request to examine or copy public records within three (3) working days of the date of the receipt of the request for examination or copying. A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a request from a person who is not a resident and not employed by a resident to examine or copy public records within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the receipt of the request for examination or copying. If it is determined by employees of the public agency that a longer period of time is needed to locate or retrieve the public records, the public agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy the records and shall provide the public records no later than ten (10) working days following the person’s request, if such person is a resident, and no later than thirty-five (35) days following a request from a nonresident. Additionally, if it is determined that the existing electronic record requested will first have to be converted to another electronic format by the agency or by a third party and that such conversion cannot be completed within the time allotted for the response, the agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy the records. The agency shall provide the converted public record at a time mutually agreed upon between the agency and the requester, with due consideration given to any limitations that may exist due to the process of conversion or due to the use of a third party to make the conversion.\n\n(3) If the public agency or custodian fails to respond within the time allotted for the response, the request shall be deemed to be denied.\n\n(4) If the public agency denies the person’s request for examination or copying the public records or denies in part and grants in part the person’s request for examination and copying of the public records, the person legally responsible for administering the public agency or that person’s designee shall notify the person in writing of the denial or partial denial of the request for the public record.\n\n(5) The notice of denial or partial denial shall state that the attorney for the public agency has reviewed the request or shall state that the public agency has had an opportunity to consult with an attorney regarding the request for examination or copying of a record and has chosen not to do so. The notice of denial or partial denial also shall indicate the statutory authority for the denial and indicate clearly the person’s right to appeal the denial or partial denial and the time periods for doing so.\n\n[74-103, added 2015, ch. 140, sec. 5, p. 348; am. 2022, ch. 306, sec. 3, p. 976; am. 2024, ch. 107, sec. 1, p. 477; am. 2025, ch. 298, sec. 3, p. 1250.]",

(1) Notwithstanding any statute or rule of court to the contrary, nothing in this chapter nor chapter 10, title 59, Idaho Code, shall be construed to require disclosure of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes by a law enforcement agency, but such exemption from disclosure applies only to the extent that the production of such records would:\n\n(a) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n\n(b) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n\n(c) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(d) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement agency in the course of a criminal investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;\n\n(e) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;\n\n(f) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel; or\n\n(g) Disclose the identity of a reporting party maintained by any law enforcement entity or the department of health and welfare relating to the investigation of child abuse, neglect or abandonment unless the reporting party consents in writing to the disclosure or the disclosure of the reporting party’s identity is required in any administrative or judicial proceeding.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any person involved in a motor vehicle collision which is investigated by a law enforcement agency, that person’s authorized legal representative and the insurer shall have a right to a complete, unaltered copy of the impact report, or its successors, and the final report prepared by the agency.\n\n(3) An inactive investigatory record shall be disclosed unless the disclosure would violate the provisions of subsection (1)(a) through (g) of this section.

The court shall decide the case after examining the record in camera, papers filed by the parties, and such oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow.\n\nIf the court finds that the public official’s decision to refuse disclosure is not justified, he shall order the public official to make the record public. If the judge determines that the public official was justified in refusing to make the record public, he shall return the item to the public official without disclosing its content with an order supporting the decision refusing disclosure. Any person who fails to obey the order of the court shall be cited to show cause why he is not in contempt of court.
