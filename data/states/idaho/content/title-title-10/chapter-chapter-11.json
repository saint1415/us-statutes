The lien resulting from recording of a judgment other than for support of a child or for restitution owed to a crime victim where the order of restitution has been recorded as a judgment pursuant to section 19-5305, Idaho Code, continues ten (10) years from the date of the judgment, unless the judgment be previously satisfied, or unless the enforcement of the judgment be stayed upon an appeal as provided by law.
