It is hereby recognized by the legislature of the state of Idaho that, as the population and economy of areas of this state grow, the total needs for mobility of commerce and people cannot be met solely with highway and road systems; that motor vehicle congestion and air quality problems result which may adversely affect health and safety; that there are a variety of persons who are elderly, who have disabilities, who live in rural areas or who otherwise require public transportation services for their general welfare; and that prosperous commerce and industry depend upon effective regional systems of transportation. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state to maintain a state commitment to improve public transportation; to increase the use of transportation alternatives to single occupancy motor vehicles; to promote cooperative agreements among governmental entities in providing public transportation services; and to attain greater efficiency in the use of public transportation funds in a manner consistent with the needs, health, safety and general welfare of the people of Idaho.\n\n[40-2102, added 1994, ch. 327, sec. 1, p. 1053.]",
