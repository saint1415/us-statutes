The highway district board shall fix and determine the amount per acre charged against the lands within the special tax district, not exceeding, in respect to any single highway, the maximum amount per acre specified for the highway in the original resolution. The amount per acre need not be the precise proportionate cost of the highway, but may be the approximate proportion, avoiding inconvenient fractions or fractional parts of a dollar, and shall be the same uniform amount per acre throughout any single special tax district.

A notice stating generally the nature and date of the order and designating the township and sections within the special tax district shall be published for at least two (2) separate times in a newspaper published in the county.

At the expiration of the thirty (30) days, all proceedings relating to the special tax district where copies of petitions for review have been duly filed shall be consolidated by order of the district court into a single proceeding, and notice shall be given and procedure followed as the district court shall prescribe. The district court shall have jurisdiction as a court of equity, and without a jury, try and determine the proceeding. On the review, the only question to be tried and determined shall be whether, in creating a special tax district and in fixing the amounts so charged against the land, the district board has observed the requirements specified in sections 40-810 and 40-811, Idaho Code. The district court shall, if it determines that the board has materially departed from the requirements, make a final order in the proceeding directing any necessary change or modification in the order of the highway district board, and that board shall make the changes and modifications in their order, and the changed or modified order shall be submitted to the district court and finally made as directed and approved by the court.
