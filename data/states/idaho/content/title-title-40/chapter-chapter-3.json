The board shall:\n\n(1) Determine which highways in the state, or sections of highways, shall be designated and accepted for the purpose of this title as a part of the state highway system.\n\n(a) In determining which highways or section of highways shall be a part of the state highway system, the board shall consider the relative importance of each highway to cities, existing business, industry and enterprises and to the development of cities, natural resources, industry and agriculture and be guided by statistics on existing and projected traffic volumes. The board shall also consider the safety and convenience of highway users, the common welfare of the people of the state, and of the cities within the state and the financial capacity of the state of Idaho to acquire rights-of-way and to construct, reconstruct and maintain state highways. In making a determination, the board must, before it can abandon, relocate, or replace by a new highway, any highway serving or traversing any city, or the area in which the city is located, specifically find and determine that the benefits to the state of Idaho are greater than the economic loss and damage to the city affected. No highway serving or traversing any city shall be abandoned, relocated or replaced by a new highway serving the area in which a city is located without the board first holding a public hearing in that city. The abandonment shall proceed as set forth in section 40-203B, Idaho Code.\n\n(2) The board shall cause to be prepared and publicly displayed in a conspicuous place in their offices a complete map of the state highway system in which each section shall be identified by location, length and a control number. The map shall be of a suitable size and scale and contain data and information as deemed appropriate by the board. Periodically, and not less than once each year, the board shall revise and correct the map to record the changes in the designated state highway system resulting from additions, abandonments and relocations. Hand maps of the state highway system shall be issued periodically for public distribution.\n\n(3) Abandon the maintenance of any highway and remove it from the state highway system, when that action is determined by the unanimous consent of the board to be in the public interest.\n\n(4) Locate, design, construct, reconstruct, alter, extend, repair and maintain state highways, and plan, design and develop statewide transportation systems when determined by the board to be in the public interest.\n\n(5) Establish standards for the location, design, construction, reconstruction, alteration, extension, repair and maintenance of state highways, provided that standards of state highways through local highway jurisdictions shall be coordinated with the standards in use for the systems of the respective local highway jurisdictions. The board shall make agreements with local highway jurisdictions having within their limits state highway sections in the category described in section 40-502, Idaho Code, and provide for an equitable division of the maintenance of those sections.

The traffic on through highways shall have the right-of-way over the traffic on any other highway intersecting with it, provided, that at the intersection of two (2) through highways the board shall determine which traffic shall have the right-of-way.\n\n(12) Furnish, erect and maintain standard signs on side highways directing drivers of vehicles approaching a designated through highway to come to a full stop before entering or crossing the through highway.\n\n(13) Provide a right-of-way for and supervise the construction of side paths or sidewalks along regularly designated state highways outside the boundaries of incorporated cities and the expenditures for the construction of them may be made from the highway funds of the county or highway districts.\n\n(14) Upon certification and requisition of an appropriate board, commission, governing body, or official head of any state institution and on the approval of the governor, showing the same to be necessary, construct, alter, repair, and maintain the roadways in, through, and about the grounds of state institutions. The construction, alteration, repair and maintenance shall be accomplished and paid for from the state highway account in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7, title 40, Idaho Code.

The legislature shall have authority to approve a total GARVEE bond amount on an annual basis. However, the Idaho transportation board is directed to allocate bond revenue only among the projects listed in subsection (1)(b) of this section. In making its funding allocation for projects, the board shall take into consideration: the cost of the project and whether or not that project could be financed without bonding; whether the project is necessary to facilitate the traffic flow on vital transportation corridors; and whether the project is necessary to improve safety for the traveling public. On and after July 1, 2008, the board shall use due care in selecting projects for bonding and shall balance and coordinate the use of bonding with the use of highway construction moneys.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)(b) of this section wherein eligible projects are listed for selection and designation by the board, if any of the designated projects are deemed to be ineligible by the board, the board shall have the authority to replace those projects with other projects listed in subsection (1)(b) of this section.\n\n(2) Prior to issuance by the Idaho housing and finance association of any bonds or notes to finance highway transportation projects, the board shall certify to the association that sufficient federal transportation funds are available to make any payments required for such bonds or notes.\n\n(3) The board shall limit annual, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses as follows:\n\n(a) In the 2006 legislative session for the fiscal year 2007 budget, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses on federally-funded highway project financing shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of annual federal-aid highway apportionments.\n\n(b) In the 2007 legislative session for the fiscal year 2008 budget, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses on federally-funded highway project financing shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of annual federal-aid highway apportionments.\n\n(c) In the 2008 legislative session for the fiscal year 2009 budget, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses on federally-funded highway project financing shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of annual federal-aid highway apportionments.\n\n(d) In the 2009 legislative session for the fiscal year 2010 budget, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses on federally-funded highway project financing shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of annual federal-aid highway apportionments.\n\n(e) In the 2010 legislative session for the fiscal year 2011 budget, total cumulative debt service and other bond-related expenses on federally-funded highway project financing shall be no more than thirty percent (30%) of annual federal-aid highway apportionments.\n\n(f) Beginning with the 2011 legislative session for the fiscal year 2012 budget, or for any year thereafter, the thirty percent (30%) limit may be exceeded, but only by affirmative action of both the house of representatives and the senate, and with the approval of the governor.\n\n(4) In the event the board selects and designates to be funded with bond proceeds any of the transportation projects listed in subsection (1) of this section, and prior to entering into agreements with the Idaho housing and finance association as provided herein, the Idaho transportation department, as part of its annual budget request prepared pursuant to section 67-3502, Idaho Code, shall include a request for bonding authority as a separate item of its budget request. This request for bonding authority shall include a list of planned highway transportation projects to be financed with such bond financing during the next succeeding fiscal year.\n\n(5) By June 30 of each year, the board shall submit a report to the legislature concerning projects currently under construction using the bond financing as authorized by the provisions of this section, and shall include a list of planned highway transportation projects to be financed with such bond financing during the next succeeding fiscal year.\n\n[40-315, added 2005, ch. 378, sec. 3, p. 1218; am. 2007, ch. 363, sec. 13, p. 1095; am. 2017, ch. 322, sec. 7, p. 842.]",
