The legislature finds and declares that the prompt and equitable relocation and reestablishment of persons, families, businesses, farmers, and nonprofit organizations displaced as a result of any state or local governmental program or project is a necessary purpose, is a cost of those programs and projects and is a public purpose. In order to insure that individuals do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole the legislature declares that relocation payments and relocation advisory assistance shall be provided to all persons so displaced in accordance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and rules promulgated by the board. The legislature finds and declares that rent supplement or purchase assistance payments to tenants and relocation payments to owner-occupants, businesses, and farmers in accordance with the provisions of this chapter are a public purpose and are necessary to enable all displaced persons to obtain decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings. The legislature further declares the provisions of this chapter may be applicable to all programs.\n\n[40-2001, added 1985, ch. 253, sec. 2, p. 689; am. 2000, ch. 192, sec. 1, p. 473.]",

(1) As a part of the cost of any public program or project, any agency using any funds for public purposes shall compensate a displaced person for his actual and reasonable expense in moving himself, family, business or farm operation, including moving personal property, and for any actual direct losses of tangible personal property as the result of moving or discontinuing a business or farm operation, but not to exceed an amount equal to the reasonable expenses that would have been required to relocate the property, as determined by the agency, and for actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm. However, the compensation authorized by this section for actual and reasonable moving expenses, actual direct losses of tangible personal property, and expenses in searching for a replacement farm or business shall be limited to relocating a displaced person, family, business or farm operation within a reasonable distance from the location previously occupied and from which the displaced person has been required to move.\n\n(2) Any displaced person who moves from a dwelling who elects to accept the payments authorized by this subsection in lieu of the payments authorized by subsection (1) of this section shall receive a moving expense allowance, determined according to regulations and schedules established by the agency, not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300), and in addition a dislocation allowance of two hundred dollars ($200).\n\n(3) Any displaced person who moves or discontinues his business or farm operation who elects to accept the payment authorized by this subsection in lieu of the payment authorized by subsection (1) of this section, shall receive a fixed relocation payment in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business or farm operation, except that the payment shall not be less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000). In the case of a business, no payment shall be made under this subsection unless the agency is satisfied that the business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of patronage, and is not a part of a commercial enterprise having at least one (1) other establishment not being acquired which is engaged in the same or similar business. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, to be eligible for the payment authorized by this subsection the business or farm operation must make its financial statements, accounting records, and state income tax returns available to the agency for audit for confidential use in determining the payment or payments authorized by this subsection. Such financial statements, accounting records and state income tax returns shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code.\n\n(4) If any agency determines that property, contiguous with property acquired, owned or occupied by an individual, family, business or farm operation, has been damaged as the result of a public program or project, it shall offer the individual, family, business or farm operation the same compensation as it might offer to a displaced person under subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section and under sections 40-2005 and 40-2007, Idaho Code.\n\n[40-2004, added 1985, ch. 253, sec. 2, p. 690; am. 1990, ch. 213, sec. 51, p. 521; am. 2000, ch. 192, sec. 3, p. 474; am. 2015, ch. 141, sec. 104, p. 453.]",

(1) In addition to the payments authorized by section 40-2004, Idaho Code, an agency shall make a payment to the owner of a dwelling, provided the dwelling has been owned and occupied by the owner for at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the first written offer for the acquisition of the property. The payment shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and shall be the amount, which, when added to the acquisition payment, equals the reasonable cost required for a comparable dwelling determined in accordance with standards established by the agency to be suitable to accommodate the displaced owner. The payment shall be made only to a displaced owner who purchases and occupies a dwelling that meets standards established by the agency, not later than the end of a one (1) year period beginning on the date on which he received final payment of all costs of the acquired dwelling, or on the date on which he moves from the acquired dwelling, whichever is the later date. Payment under this subsection will include an amount which will compensate the displaced person for any increased interest costs which the person is required to pay for financing the acquisition of any comparable replacement dwelling. This amount will be paid only if the dwelling acquired by the agency was encumbered by a mortgage which was a valid lien on the dwelling for not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the first written offer for the acquisition of the dwelling. The amount shall be equal to the excess in the aggregate interest and other debt service costs of that amount of the principal of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling which is equal to the unpaid balance of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, over the remainder term of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, reduced to discounted current value. The discounted rate shall be the prevailing interest rate paid on savings deposits by commercial banks in the general area in which the replacement dwelling is located. This amount shall also include reasonable expenses incurred by the displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but shall not include prepaid expenses.\n\n(2) In addition to the payments authorized by section 40-2004, Idaho Code, any agency shall make a payment to any individual or family displaced from any dwelling not eligible to receive a payment under subsection (1) of this section, which dwelling was actually and lawfully occupied by the individual or family for at least ninety (90) days prior to the first written offer for the acquisition of the property. The payment, not to exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000), shall be the additional amount which is necessary to enable the individual or family to lease or rent for a period not to exceed four (4) years, or to make a down payment, including reasonable expenses incurred by the displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of a dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate the individual or family in areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities, except that if the amount exceeds two thousand dollars ($2,000) the person must equally match any payment in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000), in making the down payment.\n\n[40-2005, added 1985, ch. 253, sec. 2, p. 691; am. 2000, ch. 192, sec. 4, p. 475.]",
