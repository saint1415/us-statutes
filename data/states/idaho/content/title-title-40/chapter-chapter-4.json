The proceeds of the bonds may be used or pledged for the payment or security of the principal of or interest on bonds and for the establishment of any or all reserves for payment or security, or for other corporate purposes as the board may authorize in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in a trust agreement securing them. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate, shall mature at a time not exceeding thirty (30) years from their date, as may be determined by the board and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the board, at a price and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board prior to the issuance of the bonds.
