Except as provided in chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, an applicant for a license to operate as a commodity dealer shall, before a license will be issued, file with the department a bond in favor of the commodity indemnity fund with a corporate surety approved by the department with the condition that the applicant will pay the purchase price of any agricultural commodity to the seller. The aggregate annual liability of the surety shall in no event exceed the sum of the bond.\n\nAt the discretion of the director, any person required to submit a bond to the department in accordance with this chapter, may give to the department a certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit payable to the commodity indemnity fund in lieu of the bond required herein. The principal amount of the certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be the same as that required for a surety bond pursuant to this chapter. Accrued interest upon the certificate of deposit shall be payable to the purchaser of the certificate. The certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled or discharged by the director. The provisions of this chapter that apply to a bond required pursuant to this chapter apply to each certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit given in lieu of such bond. The certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain on file with the department until it is released, canceled, or discharged by the director, or until the director is notified ninety (90) days in advance, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, that the certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is renewed, canceled or amended. Failure to notify the director may result in the suspension or revocation of the commodity dealer’s license. Under the provisions of this chapter, an irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit shall not be accepted unless it is issued by a national bank or federal thrift institution in Idaho or by a state-chartered bank or thrift institution authorized to conduct business in Idaho and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation. A certificate of deposit shall be submitted with an audited or reviewed financial statement prepared in accordance with the rules of the department by an independent Idaho certified public accountant or Idaho licensed public accountant.\n\nThe amount of bond to be furnished for each commodity dealer shall be fixed at whichever of the following amounts is greater:\n\n(1) The combined total indebtedness paid and owed to producers for agricultural commodity and seed crop for the previous license year; or\n\n(2) The indebtedness owed and estimated to be owed to producers for agricultural commodity and seed crop for the current license year.\n\nSubsequent to determining whichever of the preceding amounts is greater, and based on that amount, the amount of bond shall be calculated as follows:\n\nGross Dollars:Amount of Bond:$0 – $450,000$20,000 bond or 6% of the grossdollars, whichever is less$450,001 – $1,000,000$40,000 bond$1,000,001 – $8,000,000$100,000 bondOver $8,000,000$500,000 bond\n\nGross Dollars:\n\nAmount of Bond:\n\n$0 – $450,000\n\n$20,000 bond or 6% of the gross\n\ndollars, whichever is less\n\n$450,001 – $1,000,000\n\n$40,000 bond\n\n$1,000,001 – $8,000,000\n\n$100,000 bond\n\nOver $8,000,000\n\n$500,000 bond\n\nIn any case, the amount of the bond shall not be more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). A surety shall notify the commodity dealer and the department by certified mail at least ninety (90) days prior to the cancellation of a bond issued under the provisions of this chapter. The liability of the surety shall cover purchases made by the commodity dealer during the time the bond is in force. A commodity dealer’s bond filed with this department shall be continuous until canceled by the surety upon ninety (90) days’ notice. The director reserves the right to waive the ninety (90) day cancellation period.\n\nIf a commodity dealer is licensed pursuant to chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, that same commodity dealer may obtain a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit as a surety under chapter 5, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code. If a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written covering chapter 5, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code, the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit shall be made out in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and the seed indemnity fund. In the event a commodity dealer fails as defined in section 69-202(8), Idaho Code, and a single bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit is written in favor of the commodity indemnity fund and seed indemnity fund, the proceeds of the bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit will be allocated based on the dollar amount of the verified claims approved pursuant to chapter 2, title 69, Idaho Code, and chapter 51, title 22, Idaho Code.\n\n[69-506, added 1982, ch. 94, sec. 2, p. 180; am. 1983, ch. 116, sec. 4, p. 253; am. 1985, ch. 139, sec. 1, p. 382; am. 1988, ch. 350, sec. 4, p. 1049; am. 1990, ch. 184, sec. 3, p. 410; am. 1992, ch. 44, sec. 2, p. 146; am. 2002, ch. 258, sec. 3, p. 752; am. 2003, ch. 149, sec. 1, p. 427.]",
