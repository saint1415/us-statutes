If the applicant proposes to engage in business under the provisions of this chapter at more than one (1) location, through authorized representatives or otherwise, then the amount of the security device will be increased by five thousand dollars ($5,000) per location, up to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

In the case of a bond, the aggregate liability of the surety in no event shall exceed the principal sum of the bond. Claimants against the licensee or its authorized representatives may themselves bring suit directly on the security device or the director may bring suit on behalf of such claimants, either in one (1) action or in successive actions.

The securities or cash, or both, shall be deposited as aforesaid and held to secure the same obligations as would the security device, but the depositor shall be entitled to receive all interest and dividends thereon, shall have the right, with the approval of the director, to substitute other securities for those deposited, and shall be required to do so on written order of the director made for good cause shown.\n\n(3) The security device shall remain in effect until cancellation, which may occur only after thirty (30) days’ written notice to the director. Cancellation shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued during said period.\n\n(4) The security device or deposit in lieu thereof shall remain in place for a period of two (2) years from the date the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the director shall permit the security device or deposit in lieu thereof to be reduced or eliminated prior to the expiration of the two (2) year post-cessation period to the extent that the amount of the licensee’s payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director shall also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or such other form of security device acceptable to the director for the security device, or deposit in lieu thereof, in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state.\n\n(5) Two (2) years following the cessation of money transmission operations in this state, a former licensee has the option to transfer any funds held to pay outstanding payment instruments to the state tax commission, who shall administer said funds in accordance with chapter 5, title 14, Idaho Code.\n\n[26-2908, added 1994, ch. 410, sec. 1, p. 1287.]",

(1) For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, discovering unsafe and unsound practices, or securing information lawfully required under this chapter, the director may at any time, either personally or by designee, investigate or examine the business and wherever located, the books, accounts, records, papers, documents, files and other information used in the business of every applicant, licensee or its authorized representatives, and of every person who is engaged in the business of providing money transmission services, whether the person acts or claims to act under or without the authority of this chapter. For these purposes, the director or designated representative shall have free access to the offices and places of business, books, accounts, papers, documents, other information, records, files, safes and vaults of all such persons. The director or the director’s designee may require the attendance of and examine under oath all persons whose testimony may be required about the business or the subject matter of any investigation, examination or hearing and may require such person to produce books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and any other information the director or designated person declares is relevant to the inquiry. The director may require the production of original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and other information; may require that such original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files and other information be copied; or may make copies himself or herself or by designee of such original books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files or other information. The director or designated person may issue a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum requiring attendance or compelling production of the books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files or other information. Should the director conclude that an on-site examination of a licensee is necessary, the licensee, subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, shall pay all the actual costs of such examination. If the director determines, based on the licensee’s financial statements and past history of operations in the state, that an on-site examination is unnecessary, the on-site examination may be conducted in conjunction with examinations to be performed by representatives of agencies of another state or states. The director, in lieu of an on-site examination, may accept the examination report of an agency of another state, or a report prepared by an independent accounting firm, and reports so accepted are considered for all purposes as an official report of the director.\n\n(2) In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, any court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the director, may issue to that person an order requiring him to appear before the director or his designee to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence relating to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.
