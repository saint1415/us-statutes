The director may then liquidate the collection agency’s business, return any moneys owed to the collection agency’s creditor clients, return the collection agency’s accounts to its creditor clients, return or assign any judgments to the agency’s creditor clients, and take any other actions which are reasonably necessary to cause the collection agency to liquidate its assets and to comply with subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(4) If a collection agency refuses to permit the director to take possession of its business records, bank accounts, creditor client trust accounts, other property belonging to its creditor clients or third parties and its assets, as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, the director may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of the collection agency’s principal place of business for the appointment of a receiver or conservator as set forth in section 26-2245(1), Idaho Code. Such receiver or conservator may be the director.\n\n(5) The expenses of the receiver or conservator and attorney’s fees, and all expenses necessarily incurred in liquidation of the collection agency, shall be paid out of the funds in the control of the director or conservator, to the extent those funds exceed any sums due and owing to the collection agency’s creditor clients or other proper parties. To the extent funds in the control of the receiver are not sufficient to pay all sums due and owing to the collection agency’s creditor clients or other proper parties and to pay the costs of a receiver or conservator and of liquidation of the collection agency, the collection agency and its owners, shareholders, or interest holders shall be responsible for the balance of any reasonably necessary costs and fees of liquidation.\n\n[26-2246, added 2008, ch. 347, sec. 28, p. 956.]",
