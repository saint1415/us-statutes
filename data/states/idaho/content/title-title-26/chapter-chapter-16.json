The director may accept copies of applications for such transactions made to other state or federal bank supervisory agencies. Without the prior approval of the director pursuant to this chapter, any merger transaction between a bank chartered in this state and any out-of-state bank is unlawful.\n\n(5) A bank, the home state of which is Idaho, shall apply to and receive the approval of the director prior to any merger transaction which, if approved, would result in a bank chartered by or located in another state becoming a branch or branches of the bank whose home state is Idaho.\n\n[26-1604, added 1995, ch. 99, sec. 9, p. 306; am. 1997, ch. 225, sec. 4, p. 663; am. 2015, ch. 204, sec. 24, p. 631.]",

The director may limit the authority of any bank operating in Idaho to accept or retain deposits originating in Idaho if the bank is operating in an unsafe or unsound manner.\n\n[26-1605, added 1995, ch. 99, sec. 9, p. 307; am. 2015, ch. 204, sec. 25, p. 632.]",
