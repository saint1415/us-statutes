The legislature recognizes that continuing care communities have become an important and necessary alternative for the long-term residential, social and health maintenance needs for many of the state’s elderly citizens.\n\nThe legislature finds and declares that tragic consequences can result to citizens of the state when a provider of services under a continuing care agreement becomes insolvent or unable to provide responsible care. The legislature recognizes the need for full disclosure with respect to the terms of agreements between prospective residents and the provider and the operations of such providers. Accordingly, the legislature has determined that these providers should be regulated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter apply equally to for-profit and not-for-profit provider organizations. The provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements to be imposed upon any person, association or organization offering or providing continuing care as set forth in this chapter.\n\n[26-3702, added 2005, ch. 265, sec. 15, p. 816.]",
