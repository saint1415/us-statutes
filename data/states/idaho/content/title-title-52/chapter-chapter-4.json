The party enjoined shall have recourse against said bond for all damages suffered, including damages to his property, person, or character and including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by him in making defense to said action. No bond shall be required of the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general, and no action shall be maintained against the public official for his official action when brought in good faith.\n\n[52-402, added 1976, ch. 82, sec. 4, p. 275.]",
