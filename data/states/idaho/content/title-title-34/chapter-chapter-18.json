The legislature of the state of Idaho finds that there have been incidents of fraudulent and misleading practices in soliciting and obtaining signatures on initiative or referendum petitions, or both, that false signatures have been placed upon initiative or referendum petitions, or both, that difficulties have arisen in determining the identity of petition circulators and that substantial danger exists that such unlawful practices will or may continue in the future. In order to prevent and deter such behavior, the legislature determines that it is necessary to provide easy identity to the public of those persons who solicit or obtain signatures on initiative or referendum petitions, or both, and of those persons for whom they are soliciting and obtaining signatures and to inform the public concerning the solicitation and obtaining of such signatures. It is the purpose of the legislature in enacting this act to fulfill the foregoing statement of intent and remedy the foregoing practices.\n\n[34-1801, added 1997, ch. 266, sec. 2, p. 758.]",
