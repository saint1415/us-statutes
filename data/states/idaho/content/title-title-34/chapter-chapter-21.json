(1) The legislature must confirm or annul the election and must declare as elected the person who appears duly elected.\n\n(2) If two (2) or more persons have the highest and an equal number of votes for the same office, or if the legal ballots cast or intended to be cast for them had been counted and they would have had the highest and an equal number of votes for the same office, then the election will be decided by lot, in a manner directed by the legislature, which of the persons receiving such votes will be declared duly elected.\n\n(3) When the person whose election is contested is found to have received the highest number of legal votes, but the election is declared null by reason of legal disqualification on his part, or for other causes, the person receiving the next highest number of votes will not be declared elected and the legislature must declare the election void.\n\n(4) If a vacancy is created pursuant to this section, the legislature may declare the office vacant and order the office filled pursuant to chapter 9, title 59, Idaho Code.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 1 of this title, the legislature may call for a special election regarding a specific contested office in which an accurate vote count cannot be obtained or discovered by the legislature. The legislature has the authority to set the date of the special election and the office and candidates to be placed on the ballot. In setting a special election, the legislature may provide for a filing period and notice provisions for the election.\n\n(6)(a) Upon a final decision and award of costs and fees against the contestor, the legislature may direct the secretary of state to pay the award from the bond provided in section 34-2118, Idaho Code.\n\n(b) Upon a final decision and award of costs, fees or attorney’s fees against the contestor, and if the costs, fees and attorney’s fees exceed the amount of the bond filed pursuant to section 34-2118, Idaho Code, the contestee may petition the district court for execution of the award.\n\n(c) Upon a final decision and award of costs and fees against the contestee, the contestor may petition the district court for execution of the award.\n\n[34-2119, added 2017, ch. 293, sec. 2, p. 773.]",
