The handicapped parking citation shall provide space for an affidavit by a peace officer certifying that the recipient of the citation is the lawful possessor in his or her own right of a handicapped or disabled parking permit and that the peace officer has personally viewed the permit. The Supreme Court may provide that a copy of the handicapped parking citation constitutes the complaint filed in the trial court.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 632, § 3;Laws 1996, LB 1211, § 10;Laws 2002, LB 82, § 2;Laws 2011, LB163, § 10;Laws 2021, LB163, § 109.",
