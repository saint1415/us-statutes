The maximum area of land required to be so dedicated shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the area of any such lot and the dedication shall not reduce such a lot below a width of fifty feet or an area of five thousand square feet. Any owner of such a lot may submit an application for a variance and the city or village shall provide a procedure for such application to prevent unreasonable hardship under the facts of each case. The authority granted in this section is in addition to the authority of the city or village to require dedication of right-of-way as a condition of subdivision approval.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 99, § 1, p. 473;Laws 2021, LB163, § 104.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA city may not require a property owner to dedicate private property for some future public purpose as a condition for receiving a building permit unless such future use is directly occasioned by the construction for which the permit is sought.
