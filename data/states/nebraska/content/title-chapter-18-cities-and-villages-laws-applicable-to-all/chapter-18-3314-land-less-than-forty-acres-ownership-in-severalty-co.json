The county clerk shall proceed in such cases according to section 18-3313, and all the provisions of law in relation to the plats of cities and villages shall govern any tracts and parcels of land platted pursuant to this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1879, § 114, p. 236;R.S.1913, § 5102;C.S.1922, § 4275;C.S.1929, § 17-424;R.S.1943, § 17-425;R.S.1943, (2012), § 17-425;Laws 2017, LB133, § 325.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThis section has nothing to do with incorporation of cities and villages and, though a method is provided for vacation of plat hereunder, such act of vacating does not have the effect of disconnecting land from a municipality.
