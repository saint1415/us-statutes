Neither any such fact nor the fact that an exemption or exception is available for a security or a transaction shall mean that the director has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of, or recommended or given approval to, any person, security, or transaction. It shall be unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1965, c. 549, § 14, p. 1790;Laws 1997, LB 335, § 8;Laws 2013, LB214, § 7.",
