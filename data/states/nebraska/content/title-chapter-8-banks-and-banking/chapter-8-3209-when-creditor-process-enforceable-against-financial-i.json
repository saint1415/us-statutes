Other law determines whether creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the financial institution.\n\nSourceLaws 2025, LB231, § 9.Effective Date: September 3, 2025",
