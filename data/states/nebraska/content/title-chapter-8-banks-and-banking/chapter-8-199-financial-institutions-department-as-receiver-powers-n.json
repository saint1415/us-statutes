In like manner, the department may make, execute, and deliver any and all deeds, assignments, and other instruments necessary and proper to effectuate any sale of real or personal property, or the settlement of any obligations belonging or due to such financial institution for which the department may have become receiver, or its creditors, shareholders, or owners, when such sale or settlement is approved by the district court of the county in which the main office of such financial institution is located.
