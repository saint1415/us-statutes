The registrant shall promptly notify the director by facsimile transmission or electronic mail of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file a posteffective amendment containing the information and documents in the price amendment. Price amendment means the final federal amendment which includes a statement of the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, and other matters dependent upon the offering price.\n\n(4) Upon failure to receive the required notification and posteffective amendment with respect to the price amendment, the director may enter a stop order, without notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until there has been compliance with this subsection, if he or she promptly notifies the registrant by telephone or electronic mail and promptly confirms by letter sent postage prepaid when he or she notifies by telephone or electronic mail of the issuance of the order. If the registrant proves compliance with the requirements of this subsection as to notice and posteffective amendment, the stop order shall be void as of the time of its entry.\n\n(5) The director may by rule and regulation or order waive either or both of the conditions specified in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. If the federal registration statement or qualification becomes effective before all these conditions have been satisfied and they are not waived, the registration statement shall automatically become effective as soon as all the conditions have been satisfied.\n\nSourceLaws 1965, c. 549, § 6, p. 1776;Laws 1967, c. 29, § 1, p. 142;Laws 1977, LB 263, § 3;Laws 1988, LB 795, § 3;Laws 1993, LB 216, § 4;Laws 2015, LB252, § 1;Laws 2016, LB771, § 1;Laws 2017, LB148, § 5.",
