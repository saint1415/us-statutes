Any statutory trust established under this subsection shall be terminated upon extinguishment of all of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations.\n\n(6) The director, by rule or order, may allow any other type of investment, that the director determines is of sufficient liquidity and quality, to be a permissible investment. The director is authorized to participate in efforts with other state regulators to determine whether other types of investments are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB616, § 32;Laws 2025, LB474, § 37.Operative Date: October 1, 2025",
