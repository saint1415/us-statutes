Upon presentation of the certificate that the trust company has complied with the act and has made a pledge as provided in section 8-209, the court or other officer charged with the duty of making such appointment or of approving bonds may, in his or her discretion, make the appointment and permit the trust company to qualify without bond or require such bond as is required from natural persons.\n\nSourceLaws 1919, c. 190, tit.
