The notice may describe all or a portion of the property, but the limitation of liability provided by section 69-2309 shall not protect the landlord from any liability arising from the disposition of property not described in the notice, except that a trunk, valise, box, or other container which is locked, fastened, or tied in a manner which deters immediate access to its contents may be described as such without describing its contents.\n\n(b) The notice shall state that reasonable costs of storage may be charged before the property is returned, the location where the property may be claimed, and the date on or before which such property must be claimed.\n\n(c) The date specified in the notice shall be a date not less than seven days after the notice is personally delivered or, if mailed, not less than fourteen days after the notice is deposited in the mail.\n\n(d) The notice shall be given within six months of the date of expiration of the lease of the property or the date of discovery of the abandonment, whichever is later.\n\n(3) The notice shall be personally delivered or sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the person to be notified at his or her last-known address and, if there is reason to believe that the notice sent to that address will not be received by him or her, also delivered or sent to such other address, if any, known to the landlord at which such person may reasonably be expected to receive the notice.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 36, § 3;Laws 1995, LB 175, § 1;Laws 2016, LB221, § 2.",
