State Securities Co. v. Norfolk Livestock Sales Co., Inc., 187 Neb. 446, 191 N.W.2d 614 (1971).\n\nWhere auctioneer, in good faith, without notice of security interests of Farmers Home Administration, and for principals whose identities had not been disclosed, sold cattle, he was not liable to government in conversion. United States v. Chappel Livestock Auction, Inc., 523 F.2d 840 (8th Cir. 1975).\n\nWhere security agreement between bank and debtor granted security interest in livestock for farming operations rather than for personal, family, or household purposes or for business purposes, a security interest in livestock used in farming operations, as opposed to inventory, was created. First State Bank v. Maxfield, 485 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1973).\n\nTitle to the one hundred forty-five head of cattle passed to H & O Farms at the time the plaintiff delivered them and, therefor, any interest the plaintiff retained was no more than a security interest provided there was no agreement between the parties, either expressly or in course of conduct, that altered the result. Myers v. Columbus Sales Pavilion, Inc., 575 F.Supp. 805 (D. Neb. 1983).",
