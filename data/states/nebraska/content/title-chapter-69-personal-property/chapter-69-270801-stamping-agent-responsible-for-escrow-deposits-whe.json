To the extent a stamping agent makes payments with respect to a shortfall amount under this subsection, such stamping agent shall have a claim against the nonparticipating manufacturer for such amount.\n\n(3) A stamping agent shall not be liable for escrow deposits under subsections (1) and (2) of this section if, at the time of purchase of such nonparticipating manufacturer's cigarettes:\n\n(a) The nonparticipating manufacturer is on the directory pursuant to section 69-2706; and\n\n(b) The state denotes on the directory that the nonparticipating manufacturer has posted the appropriate bond required under section 69-2707.01.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB590, § 11.",
