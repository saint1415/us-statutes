Unless the holder of the property is notified to the contrary within one hundred twenty days after filing the report required under section 69-1310, the State Treasurer or his or her designee shall be deemed to have elected to receive the custody of the property.\n\n(b) A holder may pay or deliver property before the property is presumed abandoned with written consent of the State Treasurer or his or her designee and upon conditions and terms prescribed by the State Treasurer or his or her designee. Property paid or delivered under this subsection shall be held by the State Treasurer and is not presumed abandoned until such time as it otherwise would be presumed abandoned under the act.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 611, § 21, p. 2489;Laws 1992, Third Spec.
