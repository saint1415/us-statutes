A one-time supplemental report shall be filed by life insurance corporations with regard to property subject to section 69-1307.05 before November 1, 2003, as of December 31, 2002, as if section 69-1307.05 had been in effect before January 1, 2003. The property must accompany the report unless excused by the State Treasurer for good cause. The State Treasurer may postpone the reporting date upon written request by any person required to file a report. Any person holding intangible property presumed abandoned due to be reported with a cumulative value of fifty dollars or less in a single reporting year shall not be required to report the property in that year but shall report the property in any year when the property value or total report value exceeds fifty dollars.\n\n(e) If the holder of property presumed abandoned under the act knows the whereabouts of the owner and if the owner's claim has not been barred by the statute of limitations, the holder shall, before filing the annual report, communicate with the owner and take necessary steps to prevent abandonment from being presumed. The holder shall exercise due diligence to ascertain the whereabouts of the owner.\n\n(f) Verification, if made by a partnership, shall be executed by a partner; if made by a limited liability company, by a member; if made by an unincorporated association or private corporation, by an officer; and if made by a public corporation, by its chief fiscal officer.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 611, § 10, p. 2483;Laws 1977, LB 305, § 4;Laws 1992, Third Spec.
