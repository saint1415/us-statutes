In the event the consumer has paid not less than sixty percent and not more than eighty percent of the total of payments to acquire ownership, the reinstatement period shall be extended to a total of ninety days after the date of the return of the property. In the event the consumer has paid eighty percent or more of the total of payments to acquire ownership, the reinstatement period shall be extended to a total of one hundred eighty days after the date of the return of the property.Nothing in this section shall prevent a lessor from attempting to repossess property during the reinstatement period, but such repossession shall not affect the consumer's right to reinstate. Upon reinstatement, the lessor shall provide the consumer with the same property or substitute property of comparable quality and condition.SourceLaws 1989, LB 681, § 8;Laws 2001, LB 641, § 4.",
