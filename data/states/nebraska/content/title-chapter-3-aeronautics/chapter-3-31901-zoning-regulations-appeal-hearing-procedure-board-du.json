The agency from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.\n\n(3) An appeal shall stay any proceeding in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the agency from which the appeal is taken certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases the proceedings shall not be stayed except by an order of the board after notice to the agency from which the appeal is taken and upon due cause shown.\n\n(4) The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals, give public notice thereof, give due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the appeal within sixty days after the date of filing such appeal.
