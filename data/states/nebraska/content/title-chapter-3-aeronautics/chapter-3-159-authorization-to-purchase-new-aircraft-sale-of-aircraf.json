After completion and review of the study, the Legislature authorized the Department of Aeronautics to purchase a new aircraft in 2014. It is the intent of the Legislature to fund the purchase with General Funds and other funds. The Legislature also directed the department, upon taking possession of a new aircraft, to sell the state's 1982 Piper Cheyenne aircraft, with the proceeds retained for use for preventive maintenance funding for the new aircraft.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB1016, § 1;Laws 2017, LB339, § 49.",
