Such variances shall be allowed only if the board of adjustment makes the same findings for the granting of variances generally as set forth in subsection (2) of section 19-910, except that if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed structure or alteration of a structure does not require any modification or revision to any approach or approach procedure as approved or written by the Federal Aviation Administration on either an existing or proposed runway and the applicant provides signed documentation from the Federal Aviation Administration that the proposed structure or alteration of the structure will not require any modification or revision of any airport minimums, such documentation may constitute evidence of undue hardship and the board of adjustment may grant the requested variance without such findings. Any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of the act.\n\nSourceLaws 1945, c. 233, § 7(2), p. 686;Laws 2013, LB140, § 12.",
