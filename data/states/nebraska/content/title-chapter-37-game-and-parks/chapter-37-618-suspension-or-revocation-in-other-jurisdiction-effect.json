The person shall immediately return the permit to the commission. No person shall possess a permit which has been suspended or revoked under this section except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(3) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to create a process to (a) review the suspension or revocation of a privilege or permit to hunt, fish, or harvest fur imposed by any jurisdiction other than Nebraska to determine if the offense for which the privilege or permit is suspended or revoked is an offense under the Game Law or would constitute grounds for suspension or revocation under sections 37-614 to 37-617 and (b) provide for a hearing, if necessary, to confirm the suspension or revocation in Nebraska or reinstate the privilege or affirm the eligibility of the person to purchase a permit in Nebraska. The process may include an application for the review and a procedure for screening applications to determine if the hearing before the commission is necessary or appropriate.\n\n(4) Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class I misdemeanor.\n\nSourceLaws 1998, LB 922, § 308;Laws 2011, LB41, § 29.",
