Withdrawal shall not become effective until ninety days after the notice of withdrawal is given. The notice shall be directed to the compact administrator of each participating state. Withdrawal of any state does not affect the validity of the compact as to the remaining participating states.\n\nArticle VII\n\nConstruction and Severability\n\nThe Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of the compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of the compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, individual, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact is not affected thereby. If the compact is held contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nArticle VIII\n\nResponsible State Entity\n\nThe Game and Parks Commission is authorized on behalf of the state to enter into the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact. The commission shall enforce the compact and shall do all things within the jurisdiction of the commission that are appropriate in order to effectuate the purposes and the intent of the compact. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out and consistent with the compact.\n\nThe commission may suspend the hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges of any resident of this state who has failed to comply with the terms of a citation issued for a wildlife violation in any participating state. The suspension shall remain in effect until the commission receives satisfactory evidence of compliance from the participating state. The commission shall send notice of the suspension to the resident, who shall surrender all current Nebraska hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses to the commission within ten days.\n\nThe resident may, within twenty days of the notice, request a review or hearing in accordance with section 37-618.
