      "text": "37-404.01.Hunting permit; person with developmental disability; license-purchase exemption certificate; application; contents.\n\nA hunting permit may be issued to any person who has a developmental disability and who has a license-purchase exemption certificate issued by the commission authorizing such person to purchase a hunting permit. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to establish forms and procedures for the issuance of license-purchase exemption certificates. Any license-purchase exemption certificate issued pursuant to this section shall be issued at no cost to the person who has a developmental disability and shall clearly state on its face that the holder must at all times while hunting be accompanied as described in subsection (4) of section 37-413. No license-purchase exemption certificate shall be issued to any person who has been found by any court or mental health board to pose a current danger to himself or herself or others. As part of the application process for a license-purchase exemption certificate, a person who has a developmental disability shall present the commission with a written authorization signed by a physician indicating that the person who has a developmental disability is at all times capable of understanding and following directions given by another person and that the person who has a developmental disability is not a danger to himself or herself or others while engaged in hunting with a firearm. For purposes of this section, developmental disability has the same meaning as in section 83-1205.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB699, § 2.",
