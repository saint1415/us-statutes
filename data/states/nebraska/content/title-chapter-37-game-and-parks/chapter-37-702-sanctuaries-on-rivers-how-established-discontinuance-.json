The commission may further expend reasonable sums to feed wild fowl upon such sanctuaries. A sanctuary so established may not, without the consent of the commission, be withdrawn by the owners for a period of five years after it is established, and unless the owners of more than one-half of the river banks on both sides of the river running through any such sanctuary sign a petition for vacating the same and file such petition with the commission during the first half of the fifth year of such sanctuary or thereafter in the first half of the fifth year of any added five-year period, such sanctuary shall continue as such unless terminated for good cause by the commission.\n\nSourceLaws 1929, c. 112, IV, § 2, p. 421;C.S.1929, § 37-402;R.S.1943, § 37-402;Laws 1989, LB 34, § 19;R.S.1943, (1993), § 37-402;Laws 1998, LB 922, § 316.",
