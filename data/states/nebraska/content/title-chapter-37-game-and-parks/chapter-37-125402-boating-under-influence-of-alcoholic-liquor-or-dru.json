It shall be unlawful for a person to refuse to provide a sample of his or her blood, breath, or urine after being directed by a peace officer to submit to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood or breath pursuant to this section.\n\n(3) Any person arrested as described in subsection (2) of this section may, upon the direction of a peace officer, be required to submit to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine for a determination of the concentration of alcohol or the presence of drugs.\n\n(4) Any person involved in a motorboat or personal watercraft accident in this state may be required to submit to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine by any peace officer if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was in the actual physical control of a motorboat or personal watercraft under propulsion upon the waters of this state while under the influence of alcoholic liquor or drugs at the time of the accident.\n\n(5) Any person who is required to submit to a chemical blood, breath, or urine test or tests pursuant to this section shall be advised that if he or she refuses to submit to such test or tests, he or she could be charged with a separate crime. Failure to provide such advisement shall not affect the admissibility of the chemical test result in any legal proceedings. However, failure to provide such advisement shall negate the state's ability to bring any criminal charges against a refusing party pursuant to this section.\n\n(6) Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be punished as provided in section 37-1254.12.\n\n(7) Refusal to submit to a chemical blood, breath, or urine test or tests pursuant to this section shall be admissible evidence in any action for a violation of section 37-1254.01 or a city or village ordinance enacted in conformance with such section.\n\nSourceLaws 1989, LB 195, § 4;Laws 1999, LB 176, § 121;Laws 2001, LB 166, § 2;Laws 2001, LB 773, § 8;Laws 2011, LB667, § 11.",
