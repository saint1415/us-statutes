This section shall not apply under conditions of unusual circumstances resulting from natural causes which make the fulfillment impracticable. Every person owning or controlling such dam shall open and close gates or locks at a rate slow enough to protect the water below from a sudden flushing or sudden decrease in water flow which would be detrimental to the fish and their habitat.\n\n(2) The commission shall have supervision over the enforcement of this section and shall investigate all complaints made under this section.\n\n(3) Any person, firm, or corporation violating this section shall be guilty of a Class V misdemeanor.\n\nSourceLaws 1929, c. 112, IV, § 6, p. 423;C.S.1929, § 37-406;Laws 1941, c. 72, § 11, p. 306;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 37-406;Laws 1943, c. 93, § 1(1), p. 320;R.S.1943, § 37-406;R.S.1943, (1993), § 37-406;Laws 1998, LB 922, § 273.",
