Such license shall be valid only for the period of time during which such person's employment authorization document is valid. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the requirements to obtain a professional or commercial license that are unrelated to the lawful presence requirements demonstrated pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant eligibility for any public benefits other than obtaining a professional or commercial license.\n\n(d) Any person who has complied with the requirements of this subsection shall have his or her employment authorization document verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security or an equivalent program designated by the United States Department of Homeland Security.\n\n(e) The Legislature enacts this subsection pursuant to the authority provided in 8 U.S.C. 1621(d), as such section existed on January 1, 2016.\n\nSourceLaws 2009, LB403, § 4;Laws 2016, LB947, § 1;Laws 2020, LB944, § 1;Laws 2024, LB198, § 2.\n\nAnnotations\n\nFor the purposes of state or local public benefits eligibility, \"lawfully present\" means the alien classifications under 8 U.S.C. 1621(a)(1), (2), or (3).
