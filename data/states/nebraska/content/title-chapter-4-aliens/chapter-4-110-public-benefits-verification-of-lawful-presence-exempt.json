Prenatal care services available pursuant to sections 68-915 and 68-972 to unborn children, whose eligibility is independent of the mother's eligibility status, shall not be deemed to be tied to the immigration status of the mother and therefor are not included in the restrictions imposed by section 4-108.\n\nSourceLaws 2009, LB403, § 3;Laws 2012, LB599, § 1.",
