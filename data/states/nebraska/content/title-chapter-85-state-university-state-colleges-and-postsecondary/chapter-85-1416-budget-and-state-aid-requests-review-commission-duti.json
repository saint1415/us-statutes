The recommendations submitted to the Legislature shall be submitted electronically. The analysis and recommendations by the commission shall focus on budget requests for new and expanded programs and services and major statewide funding issues or initiatives as identified in the comprehensive statewide plan. If an institution does not comply with the commission's request pursuant to subdivision (a) of this subsection for additional budget information, the commission may so note the refusal and its specific information request in its report of budget recommendations. The commission shall also provide to the Governor and the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year a report identifying public policy issues relating to student tuition and fees, including the appropriate relative differentials of tuition and fee levels between the sectors of public postsecondary education in the state consistent with the comprehensive statewide plan.
