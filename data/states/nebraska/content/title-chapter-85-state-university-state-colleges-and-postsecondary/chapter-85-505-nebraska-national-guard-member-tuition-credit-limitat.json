When determining to whom such tuition credit shall be awarded, priority shall be given to those individuals who have previously received tuition credits while a National Guard member, and the Nebraska National Guard shall apply those program qualifications and limitations consistent with efficient and effective program management as determined by the Adjutant General.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 982, § 1;Laws 1978, LB 564, § 1;Laws 1983, LB 267, § 1;Laws 1986, LB 931, § 1;Laws 1988, LB 866, § 1;Laws 1992, Third Spec.
