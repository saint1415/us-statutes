      "text": "85-2233.Legislative intent; Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education; duties; reduction of distribution; when.\n\n(1)(a) The Legislature recognizes that education, as an investment in human resources, is fundamental to the quality of life and the economic prosperity of Nebraskans and that aid to the community colleges furthers these goals.\n\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that such appropriations reflect the commitment of the Legislature to join with local governing bodies in a strong and continuing partnership to further advance the quality, responsiveness, access, and equity of Nebraska's community colleges and to foster high standards of performance and service so that every citizen, community, and business will have the opportunity to receive quality educational programs and services regardless of the size, wealth, or geographic location of the community college area or tribally controlled community college by which that citizen, community, or business is served.\n\n(c) In order to promote quality postsecondary education and to avoid excessive and disproportionate taxation upon the taxable property of each community college area, the Legislature may appropriate each biennium from such funds as may be available an amount for aid and assistance to the community colleges. Such funds so appropriated by the Legislature shall be allocated, adjusted, and distributed to the community college boards of governors as provided in the Community College Aid Act.\n\n(2) The Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education shall certify aid amounts attributable to the allocations pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (3) of section 85-2234 and report such amounts to the Department of Administrative Services. The commission shall certify such aid amounts on or before September 1 of the fiscal year for which aid is being certified and shall distribute the total of such appropriated and allocated funds to the boards in ten as nearly as possible equal monthly payments between the fifth and twentieth day of each month beginning in September of each year.\n\n(3) Beginning July 1, 2013, the commission shall reduce the amount of the distribution to a board by the amount of funds used by the community college area to provide a program or capital construction project as defined in section 85-1402 which has not been approved or has been disapproved by the Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education pursuant to the Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education Act.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB946, § 3;Laws 2013, LB211, § 6.\n\nCross ReferencesCoordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education Act, see section 85-1401.",
