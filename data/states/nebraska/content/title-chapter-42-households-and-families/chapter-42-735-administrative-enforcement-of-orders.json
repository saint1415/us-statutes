If the obligor does not contest administrative enforcement, the order need not be registered. If the obligor contests the validity or administrative enforcement of the order, the support enforcement agency shall register the order pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 500, § 35;Laws 2003, LB 148, § 75;Laws 2015, LB415, § 33.",
