Such court has jurisdiction regardless of where in the state the employer transacts business or contracts to supply services or things, or where the parent-employee resides or performs work, provides services, or sells goods and services. A failure of service, as required by the provisions of sections 42-364.03 and 42-364.04, upon the parent-employee shall not affect the court's jurisdiction of the earnings and of the employer.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 1015, § 10.",
