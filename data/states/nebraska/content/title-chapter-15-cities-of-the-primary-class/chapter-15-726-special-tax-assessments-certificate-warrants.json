To every such certificate the city clerk shall append a warrant in the usual form, requiring such city treasurer to collect such special tax or taxes by distress and sale of goods and chattels of the person, persons, or bodies corporate owing any such special tax or taxes, if such special tax or taxes are not paid before the time fixed for such special tax or taxes to become delinquent.
