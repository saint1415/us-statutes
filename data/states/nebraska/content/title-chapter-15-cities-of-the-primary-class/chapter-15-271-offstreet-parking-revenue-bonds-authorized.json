Such bonds shall be issued for such terms as the ordinance authorizing them shall prescribe but shall not mature later than fifty years after the date of issuance thereof.\n\n(4) Any such revenue bonds which may be issued shall not be included in computing the maximum amount of bonds which the issuing city of the primary class may be authorized to issue under its charter or any statute of this state. If any city has installed or installs onstreet parking meters, it may pledge all or any part of the revenue of such parking meters, not previously pledged, as security for the bonds authorized by this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 51, § 3, p. 186;Laws 1980, LB 933, § 6;Laws 1981, LB 167, § 7;Laws 2020, LB1003, § 81.",
