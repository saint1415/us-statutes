Without limiting such authority, this may be done where uneconomic remnants of land would be left the original owner or owners or where severance or consequential damages to a remainder make the acquisition of the entire parcel more economical to the city. In the eventthat any such property is left without access to a street and the cost of acquisition of such landlocked property or land through condemnation would be more economical to the city than the cost of providing a means of reasonable ingress to or egress from the property or land, the city may acquire such landlocked property or land by condemnation.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 56, § 2, p. 192;Laws 2020, LB1003, § 45.",
