The population of a city of the primary class shall consist of the people residing within the territorial boundaries of such city and the residents of any territory duly and properly annexed to such city.\n\nSourceLaws 1901, c. 16, § 1, p. 71;R.S.1913, § 4404;C.S.1922, § 3780;C.S.1929, § 15-101;R.S.1943, § 15-101;Laws 1947, c. 50, § 2, p. 171;Laws 1961, c. 58, § 2, p. 216;Laws 1965, c. 85, § 2, p. 328;Laws 1993, LB 726, § 4;Laws 2017, LB113, § 7;Laws 2022, LB820, § 3.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA city may put into its home rule charter any provisions that it deems proper so long as they do not run contrary to the Constitution or to any general statute. Eppley Hotels Co. v. City of Lincoln, 133 Neb. 550, 276 N.W. 196 (1937).\n\nIn matters relating exclusively to local and municipal affairs, home rule charter prevails over conflicting provisions in statute. Pester v.

Zehrung, 108 Neb. 573, 188 N.W. 237 (1922).\n\nClassification is not special legislation although only one city in state falls within class. State ex rel. Pentzer v. Malone, 74 Neb. 645, 105 N.W. 893 (1905).\n\nAct was not void as to tax commissioners, nor was it amendatory of state revenue law. State ex rel. Prout v. Aitken, 62 Neb. 428, 87 N.W. 153 (1901).",
