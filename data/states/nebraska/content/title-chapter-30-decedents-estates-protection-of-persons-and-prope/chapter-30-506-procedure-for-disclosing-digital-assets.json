If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose:(1) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;(2) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;(3) none of the user’s digital assets; or(4) all of the user’s digital assets to the court for review in camera.SourceLaws 2016, LB829, § 6.",
