But without the contract of deposit, a court cannot determine whether the contract is substantially in the form provided by subsection (a). Extrinsic evidence as to the depositor’s intent then becomes relevant in determining the ownership of the account and its proceeds. In re Estate of Greb, 288 Neb. 362, 848 N.W.2d 611 (2014).\n\nWhen a contract of deposit does not contain provisions substantially in the form provided by subsection (a) of this section, the account is governed by the type of account that most nearly conforms to the depositor’s intent. In re Estate of Greb, 288 Neb. 362, 848 N.W.2d 611 (2014).\n\nWhere a contract of deposit does not follow the form provided by subsection (a) of this section and, thus, extrinsic evidence of the depositor’s intent is permitted, the party not in possession of the proceeds of a disputed account has the burden to move forward with evidence of the depositor’s intent. And in a dispute regarding the ownership of an account arising from the depositor’s death, such intent must be proved by a greater weight of the evidence. In re Estate of Greb, 288 Neb. 362, 848 N.W.2d 611 (2014).\n\nOnly if a contract of deposit does not conform to the statutory forms provided in subsection (a) of this section may evidence be presented on the issue of the intent of the depositor. Krzycki v. Krzycki, 284 Neb. 729, 824 N.W.2d 659 (2012).\n\nThis section creates no presumption in favor of a type of account and does not set any standards related to burdens of proof. Thus, in order to succeed in proving intent, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a movant must prove his or her case by a greater weight of the evidence only. Krzycki v. Krzycki, 284 Neb. 729, 824 N.W.2d 659 (2012).\n\nThis section provides that extrinsic evidence of the depositor's intent as to what type of account was created is relevant only when the contract of deposit in not in substantially the form provided in subsection (a) of this section. When the contract of deposit for an account is substantially in such form, the account will be treated as being the type of account designated on the form; if the contract of deposit is not in such form, then the depositor's intent is relevant to determine the type of account pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
