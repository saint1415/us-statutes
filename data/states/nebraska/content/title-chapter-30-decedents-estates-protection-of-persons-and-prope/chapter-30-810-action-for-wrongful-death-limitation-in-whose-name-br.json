      "text": "30-810.Action for wrongful death; limitation; in whose name brought; judgment; disposition of avails; compromise of claim; procedure.\n\nEvery such action, as described in section 30-809, shall be commenced within two years after the death of such person. It shall be brought by and in the name of the person's personal representative for the exclusive benefit of the widow or widower and next of kin. The verdict or judgment should be for the amount of damages which the persons in whose behalf the action is brought have sustained. The avails thereof shall be paid to and distributed among the widow or widower and next of kin in the proportion that the pecuniary loss suffered by each bears to the total pecuniary loss suffered by all such persons. A personal representative shall not compromise or settle a claim for damages hereunder until the court by which he or she was appointed shall first have consented to and approved the terms thereof. The amount so received in settlement or recovered by judgment shall be reported to and, if so ordered, paid into such court for distribution, subject to the order of such court, to the persons entitled thereto after a hearing thereon and after notice of such hearing and of the time and place thereof has been given to all persons interested by publication three successive weeks in a legal newspaper published within the county or, if no legal newspaper is published within the county, then in a legal newspaper published in an adjoining county, except that the court for good cause shown may provide for a different method or time of giving notice and a person, including a guardian ad litem, conservator, or other fiduciary, may waive notice or any other requirement for the mailing or receipt of instruments by a writing signed by him or her and filed in the proceeding. Such amount shall not be subject to any claims against the estate of such decedent. When the amount of such settlement or judgment is ordered to be paid into the court and is five thousand dollars or more, the county court shall forthwith upon such settlement or payment of such judgment place such amount in interest-bearing certificates of deposit or a savings account in a banking institution pending the entry of an order of distribution by the court, and such interest that may accumulate pending the entry of such order shall be distributed in the same proportions as the settlement or judgment. The hearing to approve the terms of the compromise or settlement and the hearing for distribution of the amount so received in settlement or recovered by judgment may be combined into one hearing.\n\nSourceG.S.1873, c. 15, § 2, p. 273;Laws 1907, c. 47, § 1, p. 190;R.S.1913, § 1429;Laws 1919, c. 92, § 1, p. 235;C.S.1922, § 1383;C.S.1929, § 30-810;Laws 1937, c. 75, § 1, p. 264;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 30-810;R.S.1943, § 30-810;Laws 1945, c. 66, § 1, p. 263;Laws 1971, LB 441, § 1;Laws 1990, LB 579, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesMailing copy of published notice to parties required, see section 25-520.01 et seq.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.

Jackson v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co., 178 F. 432 (8th Cir. 1910).\n\n5.

In re Lucht's Estate, 139 Neb. 139, 296 N.W. 749 (1941).\n\nProvisions of Workmen's Compensation Act, where conflicting with this section, control distribution of proceeds of recovery for wrongful death. Goeres v. Goeres, 124 Neb. 720, 248 N.W. 75 (1933); Bronder v. Otis Elevator Co., 121 Neb. 581, 237 N.W. 671 (1931).\n\n6. Miscellaneous\n\nBecause of the binding effect of a federal court judgment, Nebraska's wrongful death statute did not apply and the county court properly ordered distribution pursuant to the federal court judgment that applied North Carolina law. In re Estate of Helms, 302 Neb. 357, 923 N.W.2d 423 (2019).\n\nThis section confers exclusive jurisdiction to the county court to approve wrongful death settlements and discretionary jurisdiction to distribute the proceeds of wrongful death claims.

In re Estate of Evertson, 295 Neb. 301, 889 N.W.2d 73 (2016).\n\nThis section is silent on subrogation.

In re Estate of Panec, 291 Neb. 46, 864 N.W.2d 219 (2015).\n\nUnder this section, the only possible purpose of an attorney-client agreement to pursue claims for wrongful death is to benefit those persons specifically designated as statutory beneficiaries. Perez v. Stern, 279 Neb. 187, 777 N.W.2d 545 (2010).\n\nWhile this section includes a general statute of limitations applicable to wrongful death actions, section 44-2828 is a subsequently enacted special statute of limitations applicable to all personal injury and wrongful death actions against health care providers who have taken the necessary steps to qualify under the Nebraska Hospital-Medical Liability Act. Alegent Health Bergan Mercy Med. Ctr. v. Haworth, 260 Neb. 63, 615 N.W.2d 460 (2000).\n\nA wrongful death action and a survival action are two distinct causes of action which may be brought by a decedent's personal representative. Although they are frequently joined in a single action, they are conceptually separate. In re Estate of McConnell, 28 Neb. App. 303, 943 N.W.2d 722 (2020).\n\nA wrongful death action is brought on behalf of the widow or widower and next of kin for damages they have sustained as a result of the decedent's death.

App. 303, 943 N.W.2d 722 (2020).\n\nThe proceeds from a wrongful death action are not the property of a decedent's estate and are therefore not contemplated as a property right waived in a premarital agreement unless the language of the premarital agreement specifically waives such a right. In re Estate of McConnell, 28 Neb. App. 303, 943 N.W.2d 722 (2020).\n\nA wrongful death action brought in the name of a 6-year-old child's mother, as representative of the child's estate, was brought for the exclusive benefit of the child's next of kin, and thus, the child's father, as next of kin and beneficiary of the child's estate, was properly included in the court's instruction to the jury regarding the allocation of percentages of contributory negligence, even though the father was not brought into the action either as a claimant within the meaning of the statute that governed the defense of contributory negligence or as a third-party defendant. Curtis v. States Family Practice, 20 Neb. App. 234, 823 N.W.2d 224 (2012).",
