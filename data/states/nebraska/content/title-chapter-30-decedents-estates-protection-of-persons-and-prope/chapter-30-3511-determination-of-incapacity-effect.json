A determination of incapacity does not require appointment of a guardian or conservator unless, in the discretion of the court, such appointment is otherwise warranted.(e) Absent determination of incapacity of the beneficiary under subsection (b) or (d) of this section, a custodial trustee who has reason to believe that the beneficiary is incapacitated shall administer the custodial trust in accordance with the provisions of the Nebraska Uniform Custodial Trust Act applicable to an incapacitated beneficiary.(f) Incapacity of a beneficiary does not terminate (i) the custodial trust, (ii) any designation of a successor custodial trustee, (iii) rights or powers of the custodial trustee, or (iv) any immunities of third persons acting on instructions of the custodial trustee.(g) A custodial trustee shall not be liable for any determinations authorized by this section regarding the capacity or incapacity of the beneficiary made in good faith.SourceLaws 1997, LB 51, § 11.",
