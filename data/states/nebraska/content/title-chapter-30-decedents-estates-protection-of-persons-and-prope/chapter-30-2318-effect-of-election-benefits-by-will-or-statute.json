If any provision is so renounced, the property or other benefit which would otherwise have passed to the surviving spouse thereunder is treated, subject to contribution under subsection 30-2319(b), as if the surviving spouse had predeceased the testator.\n\n(b) A surviving spouse is entitled to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance whether or not he elects to take an elective share.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 40, UPC § 2-206.",
