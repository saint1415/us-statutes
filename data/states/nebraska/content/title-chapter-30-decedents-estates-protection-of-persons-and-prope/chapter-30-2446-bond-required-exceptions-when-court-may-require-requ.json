An heir or devisee who initially waived bond may be a petitioner under this subsection.\n\n(3) If a bond is not initially required because the petition for appointment alleges that the probable value of the entire estate will permit summary procedures under section 30-24,127, and it later appears from the inventory and appraisal that the value of the estate will not permit use of such procedures, then the personal representative shall promptly file a bond unless one is not required for some other reason under subsection (1) of this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 124, UPC § 3-603;Laws 1975, LB 500, § 1;Laws 2024, LB1195, § 3.",
