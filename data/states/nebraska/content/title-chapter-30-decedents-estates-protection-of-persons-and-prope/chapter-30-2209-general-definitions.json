Instead, under the terms of the premarital agreement between the widow and the decedent, the suit for the $100,000 was a cause of action against the estate for breach of contract, and the suit for the camper was a cause of action involving disputed title of property allegedly belonging to the decedent. White v. White, 316 Neb. 616, 6 N.W.3d 204 (2024).\n\n\"Any person interested in the welfare\" of a protected person has standing to intervene and is not limited to those persons more narrowly defined as \"interested persons\" in subsection (21) of this section. In re Guardianship & Conservatorship of Cordel, 274 Neb. 545, 741 N.W.2d 675 (2007).\n\nPursuant to subsection (4) of this section, a judgment lien on the proceeds from a sale is not a claim subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Probate Code. Pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the Nebraska Probate Code exempts liens because a lien by definition is not a liability as that term is used in the definition of claims. McCook Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 248 Neb. 567, 537 N.W.2d 353 (1995).\n\nSubsection (4) of this section does not distinguish between legal and equitable title when excluding disputes regarding title of a decedent from the definition of \"claims\". Eggers v. Rittscher, 247 Neb. 648, 529 N.W.2d 741 (1995).\n\nAs \"distributee\" is defined in subdivision (11) of this section, failure to inform court of attorney fee payments did not violate this particular supervised administration because such fees were not \"distributions.\" In re Estate of Snover, 233 Neb. 198, 443 N.W.2d 894 (1989).\n\nAn action to recover specific trust property, or its traceable product, from a decedent's estate is not a claim under subdivision (4) of this section and need not be filed as a claim against the estate. In re Estate of Chaney, 232 Neb. 121, 439 N.W.2d 764 (1989).",
