In other cases, the registrar may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or the registrar may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of any person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.\n\n(d) Informal probate of a will which has been previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.\n\n(e) A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death and which is not eligible for probate under subsection (a) of this section may be probated in this state upon receipt by the registrar of a duly authenticated copy of the will and a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy filed is a true copy and that the will has become operative under the law of the other place.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 94, UPC § 3-303;Laws 1978, LB 650, § 10;Laws 2020, LB966, § 15.",
