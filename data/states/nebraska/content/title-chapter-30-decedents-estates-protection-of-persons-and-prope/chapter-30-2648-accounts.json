      "text": "30-2648.Accounts.\n\nEvery conservator must account to the court for his or her administration of the trust annually, upon his or her resignation or removal, and at such other times as the court may direct. On termination of the protected person's minority or disability, a conservator may account to the court, or the conservator may account to the former protected person or the former protected person's personal representative. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to the conservator's liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection therewith; and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in his or her control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 266, UPC § 5-419;Laws 2011, LB157, § 45.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThere is no final adjudication of an intermediate account without an evidentiary hearing.
