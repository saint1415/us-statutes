Commercial paper, investment paper and other instruments are located where the instrument is. An interest in property held in trust is located where the trustee may be sued. If the asset arises by reason of a tort claim against a nondomiciliary decedent, the asset is located in any county in this state where the nondomiciliary decedent could have been sued if not deceased.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 88, UPC § 3-201.\n\nAnnotations\n\nCommencement of a probate case in Nebraska does not, in and of itself, preclude a decedent from having been domiciled in a different state, because venue is proper in any county in Nebraska where property of the decedent was located at the time of his or her death. In re Estate of Helms, 302 Neb. 357, 923 N.W.2d 423 (2019).",
