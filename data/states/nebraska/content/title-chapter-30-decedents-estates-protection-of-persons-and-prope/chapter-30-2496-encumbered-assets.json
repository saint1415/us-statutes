Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the distributee entitled to the encumbered assets unless the distributee is entitled to exoneration.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 174, UPC § 3-814.\n\nAnnotations\n\nPersonal representative has discretion to satisfy an encumbrance immediately if it is in the best interests of the estate.
