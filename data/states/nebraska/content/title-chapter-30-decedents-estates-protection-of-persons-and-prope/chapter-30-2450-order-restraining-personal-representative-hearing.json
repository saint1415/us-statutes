Persons with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made parties.\n\n(b) The matter shall be set for hearing within ten days unless the parties otherwise agree. Notice as the court directs shall be given to the personal representative and his attorney of record, if any, and to any other parties named defendant in the petition.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 128, UPC § 3-607.",
