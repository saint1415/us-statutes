Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the spouse, adult child, parent, or other relative of the person alleged to be incapacitated from being appointed guardian or prevent the guardian officer for one of the Nebraska veterans homes as provided in section 80-327 from being appointed guardian or conservator for the person alleged to be incapacitated. It shall be unlawful for any county attorney or deputy county attorney appointed as guardian for a person alleged to be incapacitated to circumvent his or her duties or the rights of the ward pursuant to the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act by consenting to inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment over the objection of the ward.\n\n(b) Persons who are not disqualified under subsection (a) of this section and who exhibit the ability to exercise the powers to be assigned by the court have priority for appointment as guardian in the following order:\n\n(1) A person nominated most recently by one of the following methods:\n\n(i) A person nominated by the incapacitated person in a power of attorney or a durable power of attorney;\n\n(ii) A person acting under a power of attorney or durable power of attorney; or\n\n(iii) A person nominated by an attorney in fact who is given power to nominate in a power of attorney or a durable power of attorney executed by the incapacitated person;\n\n(2) The spouse of the incapacitated person;\n\n(3) An adult child of the incapacitated person;\n\n(4) A parent of the incapacitated person, including a person nominated by will or other writing signed by a deceased parent;\n\n(5) Any relative of the incapacitated person with whom he or she has resided for more than six months prior to the filing of the petition;\n\n(6) A person nominated by the person who is caring for him or her or paying benefits to him or her;\n\n(7) The Public Guardian.\n\n(c) When appointing a guardian, the court shall take into consideration the expressed wishes of the allegedly incapacitated person. The court, acting in the best interest of the incapacitated person, may pass over a person having priority and appoint a person having lower priority or no priority. With respect to persons having equal priority, the court shall select the person it deems best qualified to serve.\n\n(d) In its order of appointment, unless waived by the court, the court shall require any person appointed as guardian to successfully complete within three months of such appointment a training program approved by the Public Guardian. If the person appointed as guardian does not complete the training program, the court shall issue an order to show cause why such person should not be removed as guardian.\n\n(e) The court may require a guardian to furnish a bond in an amount and conditioned in accordance with the provisions of sections 30-2640 and 30-2641.
