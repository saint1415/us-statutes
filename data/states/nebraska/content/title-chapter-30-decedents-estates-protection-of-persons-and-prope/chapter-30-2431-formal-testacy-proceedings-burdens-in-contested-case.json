      "text": "30-2431.Formal testacy proceedings; burdens in contested cases.\n\nIn contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship. Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution, death, testamentary capacity, and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake or revocation. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 109, UPC § 3-407.\n\nAnnotations\n\nContestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence and carry the ultimate burden of persuasion.
