If no one applies or petitions for appointment of a successor representative within the time indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of a successor representative and delivery of the assets to him.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 354, § 131, UPC § 3-610;Laws 1978, LB 650, § 13.",
