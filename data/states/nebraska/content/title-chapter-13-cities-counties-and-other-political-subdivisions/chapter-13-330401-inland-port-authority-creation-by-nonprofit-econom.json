Upon a determination that the proposed inland port authority sufficiently meets such criteria, the Director of Economic Development shall certify to the nonprofit economic development corporation and the city clerk or county clerk or clerks whether the proposed creation of such inland port authority exceeds the cap on the total number of inland port districts pursuant to subsection (4) of section 13-3304. If the proposed inland port authority sufficiently meets such criteria and does not exceed such cap, such city, such city and one or more counties, or such county shall create an inland port authority pursuant to subsection (1), (2), or (3) of section 13-3304, whichever is applicable, based on the criteria utilized by the nonprofit economic development corporation pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.\n\nSourceLaws 2022, LB998, § 4.",
