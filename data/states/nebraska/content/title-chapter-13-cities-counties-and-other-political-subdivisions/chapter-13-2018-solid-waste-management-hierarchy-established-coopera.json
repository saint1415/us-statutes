While recognizing the continuing necessity for the existence of landfills, alternative methods of managing solid waste and a reduction in the reliance upon land disposal of solid waste are encouraged. In the promotion of these goals, the following solid waste management hierarchy, in descending order of preference, is established as the integrated solid waste management policy of the state:\n\n(a) Volume reduction at the source;\n\n(b) Recycling, reuse, and vegetative waste composting;\n\n(c) Land disposal;\n\n(d) Incineration with energy resource recovery; and\n\n(e) Incineration for volume reduction.\n\n(2) In the implementation of the integrated solid waste management policy, the state shall establish and maintain a cooperative state and local program of project planning and technical assistance to encourage integrated solid waste management.\n\nSourceLaws 1992, LB 1257, § 18.",
