      "text": "13-3302.Legislative findings and declarations.\n\nThe Legislature finds and declares as follows:\n\n(1) Nebraska is ideally situated as a potential industrial, innovation, and logistical hub for multiple industries across the rest of the country. The state is home to major railroads and trucking firms, and is within a two-day drive to major cities on the east coast, west coast, Mexico, and Canada;\n\n(2) Increasingly, major companies looking to locate their headquarters or expand operations seek large shovel-ready commercial and industrial sites, commonly referred to as mega sites;\n\n(3) Nebraska lacks sufficient economic development tools necessary to acquire and develop large shovel-ready commercial and industrial sites and innovation districts, and the creation of one or more inland port authorities in Nebraska will serve as a mechanism to develop such sites;\n\n(4) In addition to the development of large shovel-ready commercial and industrial sites and innovation districts, the creation of inland port authorities will serve as a regional merging point for multi-modal transportation and distribution of goods to and from ports and other locations in other regions; and\n\n(5) Inland port authorities will serve as a vital resource for stimulating and supporting tourism, entrepreneurship, and technology-based small businesses in this state.\n\nSourceLaws 2021, LB156, § 2;Laws 2024, LB164, § 2.",
