The county board of the county in which the petition was filed shall designate such additional tract in the industrial area to which the tract is to be attached if the board shall find that the conditions of the provisions of section 13-1114 are complied with. After such designation by such county board, such tract that is designated as part of the industrial area shall be governed by the provisions of sections 13-1111 to 13-1120 as though it was part of the original designated tract as an industrial area.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 51, § 6, p. 241;Laws 1965, c. 84, § 6, p. 325;Laws 1979, LB 217, § 6;R.S.1943, (1983), § 19-2506.",
