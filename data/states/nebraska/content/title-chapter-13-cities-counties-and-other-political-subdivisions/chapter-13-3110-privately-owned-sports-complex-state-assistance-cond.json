In addition to all other information, the ballot question shall include the following language: \"Shall the city (or village) of (name of city or village) establish a sports complex economic development project as described here by appropriating annually from state assistance received by the city (or village) pursuant to the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act?\"; and\n\n(iii) If a majority of those voting on the issue vote in favor of the question, the governing body of the city or village shall implement the proposed sports complex economic development project upon the terms set out in the resolution calling for the election. If a majority of those voting on the issue vote against the question, the governing body shall not implement the sports complex economic development project.\n\n(2) Funds received by the city or village for an approved sports complex economic development project shall be deposited to a separate fund established for such project to be used exclusively as described in this subsection and shall not be commingled with any other funds of the city or village.
