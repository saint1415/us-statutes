He shall then present such petition to the county board at its next regular meeting. The county board shall thereupon cause such question of the issuance of bonds or levying such tax or both such questions, according to such petition, to be submitted to the electors of such county at the next general election, or special election called for such purpose if requested in such petition.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 86, § 9, p. 435;Laws 1971, LB 557, § 1;R.S.1943, (1983), § 23-822.",
