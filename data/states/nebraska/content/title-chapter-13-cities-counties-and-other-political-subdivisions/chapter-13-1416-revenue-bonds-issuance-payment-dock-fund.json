The county or city shall incur no indebtedness of any kind or nature upon the issuance of such bonds, and they shall so recite, and to support the use and operation of the docks and other property the county or city shall not pledge its credit nor its taxing power nor any part thereof. The proceeds of the bonds when issued shall be paid to the treasurer of such county or municipality, as the case may be, and credited to the dock fund.\n\nSourceLaws 1937, c. 37, § 3, p. 173;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 18-2003;R.S.1943, § 18-715;Laws 1967, c. 84, § 13, p. 267;R.S.1943, (1983), § 18-715.",
