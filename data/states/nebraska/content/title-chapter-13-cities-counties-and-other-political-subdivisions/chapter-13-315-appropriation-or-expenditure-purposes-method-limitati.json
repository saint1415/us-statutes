Such sum may be expended directly by the city, village, or county or may be paid to the chamber of commerce or other commercial organization or a similar county organization or multicounty organization or local development corporation to be expended for the purposes enumerated in this section under the direction of the board of directors of the organization. The total amount levied including the appropriation or expenditure made under this section shall not exceed the amount limited by law.\n\nSourceLaws 1921, c. 187, § 1, p. 699;C.S.1922, § 4392;C.S.1929, § 18-1201;R.S.1943, § 18-1401;Laws 1969, c. 103, § 1, p. 478;Laws 1972, LB 1261, § 1;Laws 1979, LB 187, § 75;Laws 1980, LB 599, § 5;R.S.1943, (1983), § 18-1401;Laws 1991, LB 840, § 24;Laws 1992, LB 719A, § 30.\n\nAnnotations\n\nProvisions under this section for expenditure of tax money and income from proprietary functions for purchase by a municipality or a county of property for industrial development violate the Constitution, but the provisions of expenditures for other purposes by a municipality or county itself or through private organizations are constitutional. Chase v. County of Douglas, 195 Neb. 838, 241 N.W.2d 334 (1976).\n\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule in determining whether a proposed expenditure of public funds is valid as devoted to a public use or purpose, and each case must be decided with reference to the object sought to be accomplished and to the degree and manner in which that object affects the public welfare. Kalkowski v. Nebraska Nat. Trails Museum Found., 20 Neb. App. 541, 826 N.W.2d 589 (2013).",
