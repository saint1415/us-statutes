Kanne v. Visa U.S.A., 272 Neb. 489, 723 N.W.2d 293 (2006).\n\nThe purpose of this section is to achieve uniform application of the state and federal laws regarding monopolistic practices. The goal is to establish a uniform standard of conduct so that businesses will know what conduct is permitted and to protect the consumer from illegal conduct. Arthur v. Microsoft Corp., 267 Neb. 586, 676 N.W.2d 29 (2004).\n\nFederal cases interpreting federal legislation which is nearly identical to a state act constitute persuasive authority. Heath Consultants v. Precision Instruments, 247 Neb. 267, 527 N.W.2d 596 (1995).",
