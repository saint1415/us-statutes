Whenever any such suspension is made, charges shall be at once filed before the city council by the person ordering such suspension, and a trial had on such charges.\n\n(4) The city council shall have the power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers, and to administer oaths to such witnesses in the same manner and with like effect and under the same penalties as in the case of magistrates exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction under the statutes of the State of Nebraska. The city council shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be authorized or defined by ordinance.\n\nSourceLaws 1921, c. 116, art.
