      "text": "14-105.City council; powers; drainage of lots; duty of owner; special assessment.\n\nThe city council of a city of the metropolitan class may require any and all lots or pieces of ground within the city to be drained, filled, or graded, and upon the failure of the owners of such lots or pieces of ground to comply with such requirements, after thirty days' notice in writing, the city council may cause the lots or pieces of ground to be drained, filled, or graded, and the cost and expense of such work shall be levied upon the property so filled, drained, or graded and shall be equalized, assessed, and collected as a special assessment.\n\nSourceLaws 1921, c. 116, art. I, § 5, p. 407;C.S.1922, § 3492;C.S.1929, § 14-105;R.S.1943, § 14-105;Laws 2015, LB361, § 1;Laws 2022, LB800, § 14.\n\nAnnotations\n\nOwner of lot must have been requested to fill lot and failed to comply before cost of drainage can be assessed against lot. If nuisance is caused by negligence of city in grading, cost of filling or drainage cannot be assessed against the lot. Lasbury v. McCague, 56 Neb. 220, 76 N.W. 862 (1898).\n\nThis section in charter of 1887, authorizing cost of filling and draining to be assessed where nuisance existed, was held constitutional, and a valid exercise of police power. Horbach v. City of Omaha, 54 Neb. 83, 74 N.W. 434 (1898).\n\nIt is within police power of state to authorize a municipal corporation to fill lots within its limits so as to prevent stagnant water thereon and to assess cost against lots so filled. Patrick v. City of Omaha, 1 Neb. Unof. 250, 95 N.W. 477 (1901).",
