One-half of the cost of such intermediate hydrants, connections, and installation shall be borne by the municipality ordering the same. The district shall also lower water mains and reset hydrants at their original locations whenever necessary.\n\nSourceLaws 1913, c. 143, § 15, p. 357;R.S.1913, § 4257;Laws 1919, c. 33, § 4, p. 109;C.S.1922, § 3760;C.S.1929, § 14-1016;Laws 1943, c. 42, § 1, p. 186;R.S.1943, § 14-1023;R.S.1943, (1991), § 14-1023;Laws 1992, LB 746, § 26;Laws 2013, LB208, § 3.\n\nAnnotations\n\nCited but not discussed.
