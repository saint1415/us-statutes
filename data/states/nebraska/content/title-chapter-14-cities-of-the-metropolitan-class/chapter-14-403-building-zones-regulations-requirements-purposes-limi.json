Whenever the city council shall determine that the use or contemplated use of any building, structure, or land will cause congestion in the streets, increase the danger from fire or panic, imperil public safety, cause undue concentration or congregation of people, or impede transportation, the city council may include in such regulations requirements for alleviating or preventing such conditions when any change in use or zoning classification is requested by the owner.\n\nSourceLaws 1925, c. 45, § 3, p. 179;C.S.1929, § 14-406;R.S.1943, § 14-403;Laws 1967, c. 430, § 1, p. 1317;Laws 1971, LB 166, § 1;Laws 2020, LB866, § 7;Laws 2022, LB800, § 134.\n\nCross ReferencesMunicipal Density and Missing Middle Housing Act, see section 19-5501.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe city, in adopting a rezoning ordinance, is not required to accomplish all the objectives of this section.

City of Omaha, 232 Neb. 676, 442 N.W.2d 182 (1989).\n\nThe Nebraska Legislature has granted the City of Omaha the power to zone property lying within its jurisdiction. Giger v. City of Omaha, 232 Neb. 676, 442 N.W.2d 182 (1989).\n\nThe term \"comprehensive plan\" in this section is not the same as \"city plan\", and does not refer to any special document drafted by a city of the metropolitan class. Sasich v. City of Omaha, 216 Neb. 864, 347 N.W.2d 93 (1984).\n\nThis section is cited as a background for history of zoning power of city of Omaha. Wolf v.
