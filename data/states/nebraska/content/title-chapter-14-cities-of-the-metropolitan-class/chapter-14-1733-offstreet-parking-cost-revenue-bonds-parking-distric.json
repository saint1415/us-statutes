All such special assessments shall be equalized, levied, and collected as special assessments. Special assessments levied pursuant to this section shall be due, payable, and bear interest as the city council shall determine by ordinance. Installment payments shall not be allowed for any period in excess of twenty years; or\n\n(c) Use, independently or together with revenue derived pursuant to subdivision (1)(a) or (b) of this section, gifts, leases, devises, grants, federal or state funds, or agreements with other public entities.\n\n(2) No real property shall be included in any parking district created pursuant to this section when the zoning district in which such property is located is a residential zoning district or a district where the predominant type of land use authorized is residential in nature.\n\nSourceLaws 1971, LB 238, § 3;Laws 1977, LB 238, § 2;Laws 1979, LB 181, § 1;Laws 1980, LB 703, § 1;Laws 2015, LB361, § 11;Laws 2022, LB800, § 316.",
