A copy of such notice shall also be provided to the applicant. The public may comment or request a public hearing within thirty days after the date such information is made available, and the director may, within his or her discretion, hold a hearing on the granting or denial of the permit if he or she determines that the circumstances justify it.\n\nPrior to issuing the permit, the director shall find that the applicant is a responsible and suitable person to conduct the business and that the proposed facility complies with the provisions specified in section 81-1521.19 and has the requisite approval of the local governing body. Permit conditions established by the department shall supersede any ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or requirements of the local governing body, then or thereafter in effect, which are inconsistent with such conditions.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 853, § 10;R.S.1943, (1981), § 81-1521.03;Laws 1987, LB 114, § 14.",
