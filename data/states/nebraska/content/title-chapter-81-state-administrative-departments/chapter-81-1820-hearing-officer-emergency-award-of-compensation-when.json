The committee shall forthwith specify a time and place for an emergency hearing and shall give written notice to the applicant. If it appears to the committee that the claim is one for which compensation is probable and undue hardship will result to the applicant if immediate payment is not made, the committee may make an emergency award of compensation to the applicant pending a final decision in the case, subject to the conditions and limitations stated in subsection (1) of this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1978, LB 910, § 20;Laws 1986, LB 540, § 21;Laws 2009, LB598, § 8.",
