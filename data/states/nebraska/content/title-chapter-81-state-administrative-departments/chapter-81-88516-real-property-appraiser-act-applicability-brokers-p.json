It is intended only for the benefit of the addressee for the purpose of assisting buyers or sellers or prospective buyers or sellers in deciding the listing, offering, or sale price of the real property, for lending purposes in a transaction other than a federally related transaction, or for real property tax appeal purposes. This opinion or analysis is not governed by the Real Property Appraiser Act.\n\n(3) A broker's price opinion or comparative market analysis prepared for an existing or potential lienholder originating, extending, renewing, or modifying a loan in a transaction other than a federally related transaction may not be used as the sole basis to determine the value of the real estate for the purpose of originating a loan secured by such real estate, and the person giving the opinion or analysis must be engaged directly by the lienholder or its agent. Such person shall have no duty to inquire as to any other basis used to determine such value.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB931, § 28;Laws 2015, LB375, § 2.\n\nCross ReferencesReal Property Appraiser Act, see section 76-2201.",
