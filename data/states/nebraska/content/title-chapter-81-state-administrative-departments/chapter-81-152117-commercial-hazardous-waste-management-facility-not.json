The local governing body shall make its decision within one hundred eighty days of receipt of a copy of the application from the director and shall notify the department and the applicant of its action. If the local governing body disapproves the application, it shall specify its reasons for disapproval. If the local governing body disapproves the application, the department may not take further action on the application unless the disapproval is reversed by court order. For purposes of appeal, the decision of the local governing body to disapprove the application shall be deemed a final order.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 853, § 9;R.S.1943, (1981), § 81-1521.02;Laws 1987, LB 114, § 11;Laws 1987, LB 152, § 8.",
