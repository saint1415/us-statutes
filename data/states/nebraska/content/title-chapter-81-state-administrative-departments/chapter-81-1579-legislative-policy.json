In furtherance of such policy, the state shall not be liable for any financial subsidy of the construction and maintenance of a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility.(3) The Legislature hereby finds that it is the policy of the state that a facility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste shall be established at a location that best protects the health and safety of its citizens and the environment. In selecting such location, the developer shall emphasize geologic, topographic, demographic, hydrologic, and other technical factors that contribute to such protection and shall construct, operate, and maintain such facility in a manner consistent with state and federal requirements.It is the intent of the Legislature that potential host communities be actively and voluntarily involved in the siting process. To the extent possible, consistent with the highest level of protection for the health and safety of the citizens of the state and protection of the environment, the developer shall make every effort to locate the facility where community support is evident.SourceLaws 1986, LB 491, § 2;Laws 1987, LB 426, § 2;Laws 1988, LB 1092, § 2.Cross ReferencesCentral Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, see section 71-3522.",
