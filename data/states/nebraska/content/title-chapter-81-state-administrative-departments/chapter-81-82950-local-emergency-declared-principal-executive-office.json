Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing, or terminating a local emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity and shall be filed promptly with the clerk of the local government and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency.\n\n(2) The effect of a declaration of a local emergency shall be to activate the response and recovery aspects of any and all applicable city, village, county, or interjurisdictional emergency operations plans and to authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance under such plans.\n\n(3) No interjurisdictional emergency management organization or official thereof may declare a local emergency unless expressly authorized by the agreement pursuant to which the organization functions, but an interjurisdictional emergency management organization shall provide aid and services in accordance with the agreement and emergency operations plan pursuant to which it functions.\n\nSourceLaws 1973, LB 494, § 15;Laws 1996, LB 43, § 30.",
