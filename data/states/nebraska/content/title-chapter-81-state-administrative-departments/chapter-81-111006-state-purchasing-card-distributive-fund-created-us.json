All rebates received by the state from any purchasing card programs entered into by the State of Nebraska, except for rebates received from separate purchasing card programs entered into solely by the University of Nebraska, shall be credited to the fund. The fund may consist of purchasing card and travel card payments and deposits received from state agencies, boards, commissions, and political subdivisions, plus any rebate revenue received on behalf of the program by the accounting division of the Department of Administrative Services. The fund may be used for the purpose of coordinating and expediting payments to vendors related to any purchasing card programs administered by the accounting division and the required distribution of any rebate revenue, after covering expenses.

The Accounting Administrator is authorized to distribute through the fund or through a vendor contractual agreement the remaining program rebates, after covering expenses. On a monthly basis the accounting division shall administratively transfer all interest earnings credited to the fund to the Accounting Division Revolving Fund within ten days after the end of each month.
