The transportation services bureau shall compute the value of such vehicles at the time of transfer and give credit to the appropriate agency and program for the portion of such value based on the percentage of original purchase cost charged to appropriations other than from the General Fund. To get such credit each agency shall make available the appropriate accounting data. Such credit shall be applied against future daily, weekly, or monthly charges but not against future mileage charges.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 770, § 6, p. 2920;Laws 1981, LB 381, § 13.",
