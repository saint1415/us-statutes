Hauser v. Nebraska Police Stds. Adv. Council, 269 Neb. 541, 694 N.W.2d 171 (2005).\n\nInvestigative stop and search of auto by police held unconstitutional where officer had no reasonable suspicion the occupants were committing, had committed, or were about to commit a crime. State v. Colgrove, 198 Neb. 319, 253 N.W.2d 20 (1977).\n\nIn the absence of any proof of factual foundation, a mere radio dispatch to an officer to stop a vehicle does not constitute a \"reasonably founded\" suspicion authorizing detention. State v. Benson, 198 Neb. 14, 251 N.W.2d 659 (1977).\n\nThis section is constitutional and authorizes officers of the law to conduct routine stops of motor vehicles to check registration and operator's licenses even though there is no probable cause to believe a violation of law has occurred or is occurring. State v. Shepardson, 194 Neb. 673, 235 N.W.2d 218 (1975).\n\nIn enforcing licensing laws, officers are authorized to stop vehicles. State v. Holmberg, 194 Neb. 337, 231 N.W.2d 672 (1975).\n\nThe provisions of this section furnish no authority for an officer to issue an order to a person not under arrest to follow him where the offense involved was not a felony nor a violation of any law regulating the operation of vehicles or use of the highway. State v. Embrey, 188 Neb. 649, 198 N.W.2d 322 (1972).\n\nCarrier enforcement officers are not granted the full realm of powers possessed by State Patrol troopers; rather, they are granted only those powers specifically enumerated in section 60-1306, which limits their powers to arrest only for stated violations which are viewed by the officer while performing a function specifically related to the duties enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of section 60-1306 or a function specifically related to those duties addressed in the statutes and laws referred to in subsections (3), (4), and (5) of section 60-1306.

App. 739, 577 N.W.2d 752 (1998).\n\nFederal district court reversed for error in granting habeas corpus relief on Fourth Amendment grounds to state prisoner who had received full and fair hearing in state court with respect to alleged violations of his Fourth Amendment rights. Holmberg v. Parratt, 548 F.2d 745 (8th Cir. 1977).\n\nWhere officer's only reason for stopping automobile was for baseless check to determine if it carried front license plate, search pursuant to stop was unreasonable and court abstains from comment on constitutionality of section. United States v. Bell, 383 F.Supp. 1298 (D. Neb. 1974).",
