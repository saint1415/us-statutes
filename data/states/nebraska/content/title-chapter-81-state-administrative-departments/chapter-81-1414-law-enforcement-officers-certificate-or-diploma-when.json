The council may extend such period as follows:\n\n(i) Upon application by a noncertified conditional officer, the council may grant an extension not to exceed two consecutive weeks for good cause shown; and\n\n(ii) The council shall grant an extension not to exceed sixteen consecutive weeks upon finding:\n\n(A) That the noncertified conditional officer immediately applied for admission to the training center upon appointment under this subsection;\n\n(B) That the training center denied the officer's enrollment in the next basic training class due to class size limitations or another reason that was not the fault of the officer;\n\n(C) That the officer is enrolled in the next available basic training class; and\n\n(D) That such extension would not be contrary to the requirements, limitations, or intent of this subsection.\n\n(h) Failure to follow the requirements and restrictions of this subsection shall be considered a violation of the law and neglect of duty.\n\n(i) The council may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to carry out this subsection, including, but not limited to, rules and regulations permitting the virtual or online completion of required training and minimum standards and qualifications for field training officers. Prior to the expiration of ninety days after any such rules and regulations adopted become effective, any certified law enforcement officer with not less than three years of experience may serve as a field training officer.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 773, § 14, p. 2930;Laws 1971, LB 929, § 7;Laws 1994, LB 971, § 10;Laws 1996, LB 1055, § 12;Laws 1997, LB 161, § 1;Laws 2000, LB 994, § 9;Laws 2012, LB817, § 10;Laws 2021, LB51, § 8;Laws 2022, LB1241, § 2.\n\nAnnotations\n\nUnder the facts of this case, a certificate for satisfactory completion of a training program relative to this section is not a condition precedent to a police officer's execution of official duties as a law enforcement officer.
