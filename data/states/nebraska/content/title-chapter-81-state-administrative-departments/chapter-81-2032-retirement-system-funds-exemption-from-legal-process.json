The Legislature's attempt to create very limited exceptions to an absolute privilege from attachment of a public employee's retirement assets resulted in a law that benefited only a select group of victims and arbitrarily protected public employees who were convicted of comparably serious crimes, yet retained an absolute privilege from attachment of their retirement assets because their crimes were not included in the amendment. J.M. v. Hobbs, 288 Neb. 546, 849 N.W.2d 480 (2014).\n\nA benefit is a cash payment or service provided for under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy. J.M. v. Hobbs, 281 Neb. 539, 797 N.W.2d 227 (2011).\n\nAn annuity is a fixed sum of money payable periodically. J.M. v. Hobbs, 281 Neb. 539, 797 N.W.2d 227 (2011).\n\nThis section exempts annuities or benefits a person is entitled to receive under the Nebraska State Patrol Retirement Act from execution, even in the person's possession. J.M. v. Hobbs, 281 Neb. 539, 797 N.W.2d 227 (2011).",
