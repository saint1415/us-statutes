      "text": "83-964.Sentence of death; how enforced.\n\nA sentence of death shall be enforced by the intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a quantity sufficient to cause death. The lethal substance or substances shall be administered in compliance with an execution protocol created and maintained by the Department of Correctional Services.\n\nSourceLaws 1973, LB 268, § 17;R.S.1943, (2008), § 29-2532;Laws 2009, LB36, § 9;Laws 2015, LB268, § 35;Referendum 2016, No. 426.Note:The repeal of section 83-964 by Laws 2015, LB 268, section 35, is not effective because of the vote on the referendum at the November 2016 general election.\n\nAnnotations\n\nUnder former law, Nebraska's statutes specifying electrocution as the mode of inflicting the death penalty are separate, and severable, from the procedures by which the trial court sentences the defendant. State v. Mata, 275 Neb. 1, 745 N.W.2d 229 (2008).\n\nUnder former law, that a method of execution is cruel and unusual punishment bears solely on the legality of the execution of the sentence and not on the validity of the sentence itself. State v. Mata, 275 Neb. 1, 745 N.W.2d 229 (2008).",
