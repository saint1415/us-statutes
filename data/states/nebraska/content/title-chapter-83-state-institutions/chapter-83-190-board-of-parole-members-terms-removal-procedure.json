The successors shall be appointed in the same manner as provided for the members first appointed, and a vacancy occurring before expiration of a term of office shall be similarly filled for the unexpired term. A member of the board may be reappointed. The members of the board shall be removed for disability, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office by the Board of Pardons after a hearing. The Board of Pardons shall promptly file in the office of the Secretary of State a complete statement of the charges, its findings and disposition, and a complete record of the proceedings.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, neglect of duty includes not attending a total of twelve full days of hearings of the Board of Parole within a calendar year. A member's failure to attend a hearing day shall not count toward such limit if the failure was due to a medical appointment that could not reasonably be rescheduled or delayed, a family emergency, illness, an act of God, or similar circumstances beyond the member's control.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 817, § 21, p. 3084;Laws 1973, LB 524, § 2;Laws 1987, LB 603, § 2;Laws 1994, LB 677, § 4;Laws 2024, LB631, § 28.",
