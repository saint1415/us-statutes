The hearing officers shall not be persons who are employees or officers of a local agency which is involved in providing services to the person with developmental disabilities. A person who otherwise qualifies to conduct a hearing shall not be considered an employee of the agency solely because the person is paid by the agency to serve as a hearing officer. No hearing officer shall participate in any way in any hearing or matter in which the hearing officer may have a conflict of interest. The department shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over cases arising under sections 83-1219 to 83-1224, and in no event shall juvenile courts have jurisdiction over such matters.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 830, § 20;Laws 2010, LB849, § 31.",
