Incarcerated parents of children between birth and five years of age shall have priority for participation in the program. The department may award a contract to operate the program. Such contract shall be based on competitive bids as provided in sections 73-101 to 73-105. The department shall track data related to program participation and recidivism.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB483, § 1;Laws 2015, LB598, § 26.",
