In such case, the same procedure shall be followed as in sections 48-173 to 48-185 in case of disputed claim for compensation.\n\nSourceLaws 1913, c. 198, § 42, p. 597;R.S.1913, § 3683;Laws 1917, c. 85, § 18, p. 213;Laws 1921, c. 122, § 1, p. 527;C.S.1922, § 3065;Laws 1929, c. 81, § 2, p. 274;C.S.1929, § 48-142;Laws 1935, c. 57, § 27, p. 201;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 48-142;R.S.1943, § 48-141;Laws 1975, LB 187, § 6;Laws 1986, LB 811, § 59;Laws 1989, LB 410, § 2;Laws 1993, LB 757, § 12;Laws 2009, LB630, § 8.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1. Modification of award\n\n2. Attorney's fees\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Modification of award\n\nTo establish a change in incapacity under this section, an applicant must show a change in impairment and a change in disability.

Green v. Drivers Mgmt., Inc., 263 Neb. 197, 639 N.W.2d 94 (2002).\n\nUnder this section, the applicant for modification must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the increase in his incapacity was due solely to the injury resulting from the original accident.

Gomez v. Kenney Deans, Inc., 232 Neb. 646, 441 N.W.2d 632 (1989).\n\nBefore an employee may obtain a modification of an agreement or award for periodic payment of compensation, increasing the compensation paid on account of a previously compensable injury, the employee must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, an increase in incapacity due solely to the previous compensable injury. Grauerholz v. Cornhusker Packing Co., 230 Neb. 641, 432 N.W.2d 831 (1988).\n\nThe provisions in this section which bar proceedings to modify an award of compensation payable periodically over a period of less than six months are invalid as an unreasonable classification.

IBP, Inc., 229 Neb. 224, 426 N.W.2d 261 (1988).\n\nA proceeding under section 48-141, R.R.S.1943, to modify a previous award of the compensation court to recover additional compensation for an increase in incapacity can only be brought within two years of the time the employee knows, or is chargeable with knowledge, that his condition has materially changed and there is such a substantial increase in his disability as to entitle him to additional compensation. O'Connor v. Anderson Bros. Plumbing & Heating, 207 Neb. 641, 300 N.W.2d 188 (1981).\n\nAn award which is payable periodically for six months or more is subject to modification on the ground of increase of incapacity due solely to the injury.

Ayers Auto Supply, 160 Neb. 658, 71 N.W.2d 204 (1955).\n\nStatute restricts basis for modification to increase or decrease of incapacity since original award. Peek v. Ayers Auto Supply, 157 Neb. 363, 59 N.W.2d 564 (1953).\n\nRight to maintain proceedings for modification is recognized. Dietz v. State, 157 Neb. 324, 59 N.W.2d 587 (1953).\n\nBasis for modification is limited to increase or decrease of incapacity which has occurred since the award and is due to the injury. Riedel v. Smith Baking Co., 150 Neb. 28, 33 N.W.2d 287 (1948).\n\nBasis for modification of award is limited to increase or decrease of incapacity due solely to injury. Ludwickson v. Central States Electric Co., 142 Neb. 308, 6 N.W.2d 65 (1942).\n\nUpon application to modify an award of compensation under this section, petitioner must establish that the disability has increased, decreased, or terminated.

Village of Prague, 141 Neb. 180, 3 N.W.2d 201 (1942).\n\nProceeding to recover additional compensation for increased disability must be brought within one year from time employee is chargeable with knowledge of his right to additional compensation.

Great Western Sugar Co. v. Hewitt, 127 Neb. 790, 257 N.W. 61 (1934).\n\nApplication to modify follows same procedure as in case of dispute except that where award is made by district court, application should be filed in that court. Metropolitan Dining Room v. Jensen, 126 Neb. 765, 254 N.W. 405 (1934).\n\nConstruing this with preceding section, award is subject to modification if it covers period over six months, part of which has expired before award was made.

App. 877, 915 N.W.2d 615 (2018).\n\nSections 48-139 and 48-140 and this section emphasize the finality of a lump-sum settlement and only contemplate \"readjustment\" if the \"settlement\" itself is procured by fraud; the statutes do not speak to readjusting underlying \"awards\" allegedly procured by fraud. Hunt v. Pick's Pack-Hauler, 23 Neb. App. 278, 869 N.W.2d 723 (2015).\n\nA court may modify a workers' compensation award based on a change in incapacity due to a mental condition arising out of a work-related physical injury if the change is due solely to the work-related injury.

App. 79, 740 N.W.2d 378 (2007).\n\nIn order to achieve a modification of a lump-sum payment that has been approved by court order pursuant to section 48-139 on the ground of increased or decreased incapacity, a party must make an application on the ground of increase or decrease of incapacity due solely to the injury.

App. 129, 723 N.W.2d 350 (2006).\n\nIn the context of body as a whole injuries, an applicant for modification who must fulfill the requirements set forth in this section by demonstrating a change in incapacity must establish both a change in the employee's physical condition, or impairment, and a change in the employee's disability. Bronzynski v. Model Electric, 14 Neb. App. 355, 707 N.W.2d 46 (2005).\n\nLump-sum settlements in workers' compensation actions cannot be modified in the future or be considered when determining future workers' compensation awards, because such awards are \"final.\" Dukes v. University of Nebraska, 12 Neb. App. 539, 679 N.W.2d 249 (2004).\n\nA workers' compensation award may be modified at any time after 6 months from the date of the agreement or award, following an application made by either party on the ground of increase or decrease of incapacity due solely to the injury.
