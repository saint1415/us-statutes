      "text": "48-680.Short-time compensation program; weekly benefit amount; provisions applicable to individuals.\n\n(1) The short-time compensation weekly benefit amount shall be the product of the regular weekly unemployment compensation amount for a week of total unemployment multiplied by the percentage of reduction in the individual's usual weekly hours of work.\n\n(2) An individual may be eligible for short-time compensation or unemployment compensation, as appropriate, except that no individual shall be eligible for combined benefits in any benefit year in an amount more than the maximum entitlement established for regular unemployment compensation, nor shall an individual be paid short-time compensation benefits for more than fifty-two weeks under a short-time compensation plan.\n\n(3) The short-time compensation paid to an individual shall be deducted from the maximum entitlement amount of unemployment compensation established for that individual's benefit year.\n\n(4) Provisions applicable to unemployment compensation claimants shall apply to short-time compensation claimants to the extent that they are not inconsistent with short-time compensation provisions. An individual who files an initial claim for short-time compensation benefits shall receive a monetary determination.\n\n(5) The following provisions apply to individuals who work for both a short-time compensation employer and another employer during weeks covered by the approved short-time compensation plan:\n\n(a) If combined hours of work in a week for both employers does not result in a reduction of at least ten percent, or, if higher, the minimum percentage of reduction required to be eligible for a short-time compensation, of the usual weekly hours of work with the short-time employer, the individual shall not be entitled to short-time compensation;\n\n(b) If the combined hours of work for both employers results in a reduction equal to or greater than ten percent, or, if higher, the minimum percentage reduction required to be eligible for short-time compensation, of the usual weekly hours of work for the short-time compensation employer, the short-time compensation payable to the individual is reduced for that week and is determined by multiplying the weekly unemployment benefit amount for a week of total unemployment by the percentage by which the combined hours of work have been reduced by ten percent, or, if higher, the minimum percentage reduction required to be eligible for short-time compensation, or more of the individual's usual weekly hours of work. A week for which benefits are paid under this subdivision shall be reported as a week of short-time compensation; and\n\n(c) If an individual worked the reduced percentage of the usual weekly hours of work for the short-time compensation employer and is available for all his or her usual hours of work with the short-time compensation employer, and the individual did not work any hours for the other employer, either because of the lack of work with that employer or because the individual is excused from work with the other employer, the individual shall be eligible for short-time compensation for that week. The benefit amount for such week shall be calculated as provided in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(6) An individual who is not provided any work during a week by the short-time compensation employer, or any other employer, and who is otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation shall be eligible for the amount of unemployment compensation to which he or she would otherwise be eligible.\n\n(7) An individual who is not provided any work by the short-time compensation employer during a week, but who works for another employer and is otherwise eligible, may be paid unemployment compensation for that week subject to the disqualifying income and other provisions applicable to claims for regular compensation.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB961, § 21.",
