Any party who requests such informal dispute resolution shall not be precluded from filing a petition pursuant to section 48-173 if otherwise permitted. If informal dispute resolution is ordered by the compensation court on its own motion, the compensation court may state a date for the case to return to court. Such date shall be no longer than ninety days after the date the order was signed unless the court grants an extension upon request of the parties. No settlement reached as the result of an informal dispute resolution proceeding shall be final or binding unless such settlement is in conformity with the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act. Any such settlement shall be voluntarily entered into by the parties.\n\n(b)(i) Except as permitted in subdivision (b)(ii) of this subsection, a mediator shall not make a report, assessment, evaluation, recommendation, finding, or other communication regarding a mediation to a judge of the compensation court that may make a ruling on the dispute that is the subject of the mediation.\n\n(ii) A mediator may disclose:\n\n(A) Whether the mediation occurred or has terminated, whether a settlement was reached, and attendance; and\n\n(B) A mediation communication evidencing abuse, neglect, abandonment, or exploitation of an individual to a public agency responsible for protecting individuals against such mistreatment.\n\n(iii) A communication made in violation of subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection shall not be considered by a judge of the compensation court.\n\n(c) Informal dispute resolution proceedings shall be regarded as settlement negotiations and no admission, representation, or statement made in informal dispute resolution proceedings, not otherwise discoverable or obtainable, shall be admissible as evidence or subject to discovery.

Any information from the files, reports, notes of the staff member or mediator, or other materials or communications, oral or written, relating to an informal dispute resolution proceeding obtained by a staff member or mediator is privileged and confidential and may not be disclosed without the written consent of all parties to the proceeding.
