Payment in whole or in part of such compensation by either the employer or the insurer, as the case may be, shall, to the extent thereof, be a bar to recovery against the other of the amount so paid. No agreement by an employee to pay any portion of premium paid by his or her employer or to contribute to a benefit fund or department maintained by such employer for the purpose of providing compensation as required by the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act shall be valid, and any employer who makes a deduction for such purpose from the pay of any employee entitled to the benefits of such act shall be guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. Nothing in this section invalidates or prohibits agreements pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 48-115 or section 48-115.02.\n\nSourceLaws 1913, c. 198, § 48, p. 600;R.S.1913, § 3689;C.S.1922, § 3071;C.S.1929, § 48-148;R.S.1943, § 48-147;Laws 1971, LB 572, § 10;Laws 1977, LB 40, § 273;Laws 1986, LB 811, § 74;Laws 1997, LB 474, § 6;Laws 1999, LB 216, § 11.\n\nAnnotations\n\nPension benefits made under city ordinance did not affect the right of plaintiff to claim and receive under Workmen's Compensation Act.
