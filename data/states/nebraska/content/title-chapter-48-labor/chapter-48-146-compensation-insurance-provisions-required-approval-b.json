Such agreement shall be construed to be a direct promise by the workers' compensation insurer or risk management pool to the person entitled to compensation enforceable in his or her name. Each workers' compensation insurance policy and each agreement forming a risk management pool shall be deemed to be made subject to the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act. No corporation, association, or organization shall enter into a workers' compensation insurance policy unless copies of such forms have been filed with and approved by the Department of Insurance. Each workers' compensation insurance policy and each agreement pursuant to section 44-4304 providing group self-insurance coverage of workers' compensation liability by a risk management pool shall contain a clause to the effect (1) that as between the employer and the workers' compensation insurer or risk management pool the notice to or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the employer shall be deemed notice or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of the insurer or risk management pool, (2) that jurisdiction of the employer for the purpose of such act shall be jurisdiction of the insurer or risk management pool, and (3) that the insurer or risk management pool shall in all things be bound by the awards, judgments, or decrees rendered against such employer. Except when the Professional Employer Organization Registration Act allows coverage to be limited to co-employees as specified in a professional employer agreement, each workers' compensation insurance policy and each agreement providing such group self-insurance coverage shall include within its terms the payment of compensation to all employees who are within the scope and purview of the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act, including potential new or unknown employees.\n\nSourceLaws 1913, c. 198, § 47, p. 599;R.S.1913, § 3688;Laws 1917, c. 85, § 22, p. 215;C.S.1922, § 3070;C.S.1929, § 48-147;Laws 1933, c. 91, § 1, p. 364;Laws 1935, c. 57, § 32, p. 203;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 48-147;R.S.1943, § 48-146;Laws 1949, c. 162, § 1, p. 415;Laws 1967, c. 291, § 2, p. 795;Laws 1971, LB 572, § 9;Laws 1986, LB 811, § 71;Laws 1987, LB 398, § 44;Laws 1988, LB 1146, § 2;Laws 1997, LB 474, § 5;Laws 1999, LB 216, § 10;Laws 2005, LB 238, § 11;Laws 2010, LB579, § 17.\n\nCross ReferencesConstruction of section, see section 48-115.01.Professional Employer Organization Registration Act, see section 48-2701.Risk management pool, defined, see section 44-4303.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
