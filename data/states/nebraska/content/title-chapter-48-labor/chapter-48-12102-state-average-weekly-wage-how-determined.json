The state average annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by fifty-two, and the state average weekly wage thus determined shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. The state average weekly wage as so determined shall be applicable for the calendar year commencing January 1 following the October 1 determination.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 757, § 6;Laws 2005, LB 13, § 4.\n\nCross ReferencesEmployment Security Law, see section 48-601.",
