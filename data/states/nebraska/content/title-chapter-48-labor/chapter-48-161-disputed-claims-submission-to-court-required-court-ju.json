Jurisdiction\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n\nA contractual dispute over private agreements for disability coverage that is not workers' compensation coverage is not ancillary to the Workers' Compensation Court's primary jurisdiction. Bower v. Eaton Corp., 301 Neb. 311, 918 N.W.2d 249 (2018).\n\nAncillary jurisdiction does not include the power to enforce an award. Burnham v.

Bosse, 202 Neb. 1, 272 N.W.2d 750 (1978).\n\nAlthough the Workers' Compensation Court has jurisdiction to decide ancillary matters to a workers' compensation claim, an award of attorney fees for the creation of a common fund is not within such ancillary jurisdiction when the entity from which such fees are sought is not a party to the case. Heesch v. Swimtastic Swim School, 20 Neb. App. 260, 823 N.W.2d 211 (2012).\n\nEven though this section vests the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Court with jurisdiction to decide issues ancillary to an employee's right to workers' compensation benefits, such jurisdiction is not exclusive and a district court has jurisdiction to hear a declaratory judgment action regarding a workers' compensation insurance policy coverage dispute. Kruid v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 17 Neb. App. 687, 770 N.W.2d 652 (2009).\n\nAlthough, as a statutorily created court, the Workers' Compensation Court is a tribunal of limited and special jurisdiction and has only such authority as has been conferred on it by statute, under this section, the compensation court has jurisdiction to decide any issue ancillary to the resolution of an employee's right to workers' compensation benefits. Nerison v. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, 17 Neb. App. 161, 757 N.W.2d 21 (2008).\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\nEmployer may initiate workmen's compensation proceeding. Fidelity & Casualty Co. v.
