The Legislature may, during the 1987 regular session, prohibit by law any order of the Commission of Industrial Relations relating to state employees for fiscal year 1987-88 if it finds such order will be inconsistent with any legislation passed during the 1987 regular session dealing with collective bargaining by state employees. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the State Employees Collective Bargaining Act is inconsistent with an order relating to state employees for fiscal year 1987-88 and therefor such orders shall be prohibited.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, LB 1250, § 3;Laws 1987, LB 661, § 31.\n\nCross ReferencesState Employees Collective Bargaining Act, see section 81-1369.",
