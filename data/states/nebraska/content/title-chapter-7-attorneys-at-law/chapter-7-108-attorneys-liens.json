Unof. 480, 89 N.W. 276 (1902).Where a decree enjoining collection of judgment and allowing a setoff conditions the injunction on payment into court of a sum more than sufficient to satisfy lien, it is unnecessary to consider relative priorities of setoff and the attorney's lien. Commercial State Bank of Crawfordsville v. Ketchum, 1 Neb. Unof. 454, 96 N.W. 614 (1901).4.

Patrick v. Leach, 17 F. 476 (Cir. Ct., D. Neb. 1881).6.
