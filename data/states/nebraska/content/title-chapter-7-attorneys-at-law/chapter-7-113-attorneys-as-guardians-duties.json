      "text": "7-113.Attorneys as guardians; duties.\n\nIt shall be the duty of every attorney to act as the guardian of a minor or incompetent defendant in any suit pending against him when appointed for that purpose by an order of the court. He shall prepare himself to make the proper defense, to guard the rights of such defendant, and shall be entitled to such compensation as the court shall deem reasonable.\n\nSourceR.S.1866, c. 3, § 14, p. 16;R.S.1913, § 277;C.S.1922, § 272;C.S.1929, § 7-113;R.S.1943, § 7-113;Laws 1961, c. 13, § 1, p. 105.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.

In re Estate of Manning, 85 Neb. 60, 122 N.W. 711 (1909).\n\nA guardian ad litem has no authority to make stipulations for allowances against estate of ward, and at every stage of proceedings it is his duty to insist upon strict proof of everything which affects the rights of the ward. Court has no authority to appoint guardian ad litem until ward is served with process. In re Estate of Manning, 83 Neb. 417, 119 N.W. 672 (1909).",
