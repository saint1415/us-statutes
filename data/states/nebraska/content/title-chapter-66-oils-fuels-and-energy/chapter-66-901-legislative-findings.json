The Legislature therefor declares that the purpose of sections 66-901 to 66-914 is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by protecting access to solar energy and wind energy as provided in sections 66-901 to 66-914.\n\nSourceLaws 1979, LB 353, § 1;Laws 1997, LB 140, § 1;Laws 2012, LB828, § 1.",
