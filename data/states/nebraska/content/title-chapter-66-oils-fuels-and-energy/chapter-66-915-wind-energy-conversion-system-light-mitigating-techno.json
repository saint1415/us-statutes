If FAA approval is not granted after application is made pursuant to such subsection, the wind energy conversion system may commence or continue, as applicable, commercial operation without a light-mitigating technology system.\n\n(4) Any costs associated with the installation, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a light-mitigating technology system shall be the responsibility of the developer, owner, or operator of the wind energy conversion system.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require mitigation of light pollution to be carried out in a manner that conflicts with federal law or requirements, including requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration or the United States Department of Defense.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any new or separate approval from any state or local governmental agency.\n\nSourceLaws 2024, LB1370, § 4.",
