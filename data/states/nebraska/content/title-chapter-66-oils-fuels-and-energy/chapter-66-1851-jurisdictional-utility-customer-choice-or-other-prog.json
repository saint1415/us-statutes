In any rate determination made under the act, the commission shall not penalize the utility for any action prudently taken or decision prudently made under its approved bundling program, by imputing revenue at maximum rates or otherwise.\n\n(3) The commission may not modify the provisions of a program under this section except upon complaint or the commission's own motion, wherein the commission finds, after hearing, that one or more aspects of the program are unduly preferential, unjustly discriminatory, or not just and reasonable.\n\nSourceLaws 2003, LB 790, § 51.",
