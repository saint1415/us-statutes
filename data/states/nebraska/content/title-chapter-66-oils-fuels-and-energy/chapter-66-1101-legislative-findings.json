Geothermal energy is an indigenous, renewable resource the development of which will benefit local economies. The Legislature further finds and declares that a permit system is necessary to protect Nebraska's ground and surface water resources and existing water users, particularly where the development of geothermal energy requires the utilization of geothermal resources at a location other than the well site.\n\nSourceLaws 1982, LB 708, § 1.",
