Furthermore, owners of petroleum tanks may not have the ability to assess and clean up any releases from those petroleum tanks.\n\n(3) The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest that a distribution network for petroleum be available to the public in the State of Nebraska. It is essential in this state to encourage owners of petroleum tanks across the state to remain in business to maintain the viability of the distribution network. At the present time, meeting financial responsibility requirements imposed by the federal government has placed a burden on the owners of petroleum tanks that jeopardizes their ability to store and distribute petroleum and to remain a part of the distribution network.\n\nSourceLaws 1989, LB 289, § 2.\n\nCross ReferencesEnvironmental Protection Act, see section 81-1532.",
