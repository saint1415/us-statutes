To do so, the Secretary of State shall provide the partnership at least sixty days' written notice of intent to revoke the statement. The notice must be mailed to the partnership at its chief executive office set forth in the last filed statement of qualification or annual report. The notice must specify the annual report or certificate of authority, if applicable, that has not been filed, the fee that has not been paid, and the effective date of the revocation. The revocation is not effective if the annual report and certificate of authority, if applicable, is filed and the fee is paid before the effective date of the revocation.\n\n(5) A revocation under subsection (4) of this section only affects a partnership's status as a limited liability partnership and is not an event of dissolution of the partnership.\n\n(6) A partnership whose statement of qualification has been revoked may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within two years after the effective date of the revocation. The application must state:\n\n(a) The name of the partnership and the effective date of the revocation; and\n\n(b) That the ground for revocation either did not exist or has been corrected.\n\n(7) A reinstatement under subsection (6) of this section relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the revocation, and the partnership's status as a limited liability partnership continues as if the revocation had never occurred.\n\n(8) A correction or an amendment to the annual report may be filed at any time.\n\nSourceLaws 1997, LB 523, § 56;Laws 2004, LB 16, § 7;Laws 2008, LB383, § 8;Laws 2014, LB774, § 5.",
