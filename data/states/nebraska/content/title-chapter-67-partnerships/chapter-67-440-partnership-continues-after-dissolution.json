The partnership is terminated when the winding up of its business is completed.\n\n(2) At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up of its business is completed, all of the partners, including any dissociating partner other than a wrongfully dissociating partner, may waive the right to have the partnership's business wound up and the partnership terminated. In that event:\n\n(a) The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and\n\n(b) The rights of a third party accruing under subdivision (1) of section 67-442 or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver may not be adversely affected.\n\nSourceLaws 1997, LB 523, § 40.",
