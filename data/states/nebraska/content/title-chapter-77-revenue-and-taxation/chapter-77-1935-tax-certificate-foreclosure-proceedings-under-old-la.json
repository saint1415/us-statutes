The money paid to the county treasurer as subsequent taxes shall be held by the county treasurer in escrow until there has been a final adjudication as to the validity of the tax foreclosure proceedings under attack, and not unless and until such proceedings have been adjudicated to be invalid shall the county treasurer distribute the subsequent taxes thus paid to the state and governmental subdivisions entitled to participate therein. The payment of such taxes and court costs shall be a prerequisite to the filing of any such action. In the event the party bringing action to contest the validity of such tax foreclosure proceedings is unsuccessful, the clerk of the district court shall refund to such party, after deducting all unpaid costs assessed against him by the court in such action, the balance remaining after such deduction of the amount of any costs and taxes paid to such clerk as a condition precedent to institution of such action. The county treasurer shall also refund all subsequent taxes paid by such party in the event he is unsuccessful.\n\nSourceLaws 1947, c. 264, § 3, p. 855.",
