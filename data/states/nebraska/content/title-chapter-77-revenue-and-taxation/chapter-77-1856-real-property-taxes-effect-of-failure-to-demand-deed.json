No county treasurer or bonded abstracter shall be held responsible on his or her bond or otherwise on account of such entry being made in accordance with this section. All real property covered by tax sales that comes within the provisions of sections 77-1801 to 77-1860 shall from the time of this entry be considered to stand of record as though no tax sale had ever been made.\n\nSourceLaws 1903, c. 73, § 241, p. 478;R.S.1913, § 6569;Laws 1915, c. 112, § 1, p. 261;C.S.1922, § 6097;C.S.1929, § 77-2049;R.S.1943, § 77-1856;Laws 1977, LB 6, § 1;Laws 1992, LB 1063, § 167;Laws 1992, Second Spec.

Limitation of action\n\nAction to foreclose tax lien may be instituted within five years by filing of cross-petition in partition suit. Fairley v. Kemper, 174 Neb. 565, 118 N.W.2d 754 (1962).\n\nAction to foreclose a tax sale certificate, except as to minors and incompetents, must be brought within five years from the date of the tax sale certificate.

Speidel v. Scotts Bluff County, 125 Neb. 431, 250 N.W. 555 (1933).\n\nWhere right of action on certificate has lapsed, it carries with it all right to recover for subsequent taxes. Battelle v. Douglas County, 65 Neb. 329, 91 N.W. 412 (1902).\n\nStatute operates not merely to defeat the remedy, but limits the duration of lien itself. Carson v. Broady, 56 Neb. 648, 77 N.W. 80 (1898).\n\nStatute is not a bar to recovery of taxes under provisions of occupying claimant's act. Lothrop v. Michaelson, 44 Neb. 633, 63 N.W. 28 (1895).",
