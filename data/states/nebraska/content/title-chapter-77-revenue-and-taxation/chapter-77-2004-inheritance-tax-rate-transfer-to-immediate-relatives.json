Family member\n\n2. Tax rate\n\n1. Family member\n\nThe language \"any person to whom the deceased for not less than ten years prior to death stood in the acknowledged relation of a parent\" is not limited in application to blood relatives, and includes parties to whom the decedent stood \"in loco parentis\". In determining if the requisite acknowledged parental relationship exists for purposes of this section, the following factors should guide the trial court: (1) the family, (2) assumption of the responsibility for support beyond occasional gifts and financial aid, (3) exercise of parental authority and discipline, (4) relationship by blood or marriage, (5) advice and guidance to the child, (6) sharing of time and affection, and (7) existence of written documentation evincing the decedent's intent to act as parent. In re Estate of Ackerman, 250 Neb. 665, 550 N.W.2d 678 (1996).\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether a devisee under a will is a \"person to whom the deceased for not less than ten years prior to death stood in the acknowledged relation of a parent\" under this section, it is not necessary that there be a written acknowledgment. In re Estate of Stanton, 245 Neb. 942, 516 N.W.2d 586 (1994).\n\nSection 77-2005.01 expands the operation of this section and section 77-2005, extending the same tax treatment to the relatives of a former spouse to whom the deceased person was married at the time of the spouse's death, but in no sense conflicts with either of the other two statutes. In re Estate of Morse, 241 Neb. 40, 486 N.W.2d 195 (1992).\n\nPhysical absence from home of testatrix, while attending school, did not of itself prevent stepdaughter from being member of household of testatrix for inheritance tax purposes. Wondra v. Platte Valley State Bank & Trust Co., 194 Neb. 41, 230 N.W.2d 182 (1975).\n\nPersons standing in loco parentis for ten years prior to death are within provisions of this section even though they are not relatives of the blood. In re Estate of Dowell, 149 Neb. 599, 31 N.W.2d 745 (1948).\n\nFactual findings necessary in determining whether the requisite acknowledged parent-child relationship of this section exists should be reviewed for sufficient evidence and should not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong. In re Estate of Chambers, 27 Neb. App. 398, 932 N.W.2d 343 (2019); In re Estate of Sedlacek, 27 Neb. App. 390, 932 N.W.2d 91 (2019).\n\nThe following factors serve as appropriate guideposts to the trial court in making a determination of an acknowledged relationship of a parent under this section: (1) reception of the child into the home and treatment of the child as a member of the family, (2) assumption of the responsibility for support beyond occasional gifts and financial aid, (3) exercise of parental authority and discipline, (4) relationship by blood or marriage, (5) advice and guidance to the child, (6) sharing of time and affection, and (7) existence of written documentation evincing the decedent's intent to act as parent. In re Estate of Chambers, 27 Neb. App. 398, 932 N.W.2d 343 (2019); In re Estate of Sedlacek, 27 Neb. App. 390, 932 N.W.2d 91 (2019).\n\nEven though a natural parent-child relationship may exist elsewhere, if the parties regard each other in all of the usual incidents and relationships of family life as parent and child, the benefits of this section should be allowed. In re Estate of Malloy, 15 Neb. App. 755, 736 N.W.2d 399 (2007).\n\nThe burden is on the taxpayer to show that he or she clearly falls within the statutory language. In re Estate of Malloy, 15 Neb. App. 755, 736 N.W.2d 399 (2007).\n\nPersons standing in loco parentis are within the intent and scope of this section. The fact that a parent-child relationship may start when both parties are adults, or may begin when the child is a minor and continue after that child reaches adulthood, is not a bar to a claim brought under this section. While a child's residence is necessarily a factor to be considered in determining whether a parent-child relationship exists for purposes of this section, it is not the only factor. In re Estate of Quinn, 1 Neb. App. 1025, 510 N.W.2d 488 (1993).\n\n2. Tax rate\n\nClear market value is measured by the fair market value of the property as of the date of the death of the grantor, less the consideration paid for the property. In re Estate of Craven, 281 Neb. 122, 794 N.W.2d 406 (2011).\n\nAn inheritance by the widower of a daughter is not taxable at the rate prescribed by this section. Todd v. County of Box Butte, 169 Neb. 311, 99 N.W.2d 245 (1959).\n\nFor purpose of inheritance tax, property should be valued at amount of money which it would produce if offered and sold for cash at time of death of decedent. In re Woolsey's Estate, 109 Neb. 138, 190 N.W. 215 (1922).\n\nLaw abolishing estates of dower and curtesy gives surviving spouse enlarged estate of same kind and nature as that of dower or curtesy, and, like dower, is not subject to inheritance tax. In re Estate of Strahan v. Wayne County, 93 Neb. 828, 142 N.W. 678 (1913).\n\nWhere widow elects to take under the will, her interest, to extent of statutory interest, is exempt from tax. In re Estate of Sanford, 91 Neb. 752, 137 N.W. 864 (1912).",
