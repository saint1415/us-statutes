Any proceeds from the issuance and sale of bonds pursuant to the Good Life District Economic Development Act to provide funds to carry out the good life district economic development program, shall be deposited into the good life district economic development fund, or with a bond trustee pursuant to any resolution, trust indenture, or other security instrument entered into in connection with the issuance of such bonds, or as otherwise provided in section 77-4423.
