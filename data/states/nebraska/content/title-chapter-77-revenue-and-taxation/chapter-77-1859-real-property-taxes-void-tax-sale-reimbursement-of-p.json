McDonald v. County of Lincoln, 141 Neb. 741, 4 N.W.2d 903 (1942).\n\nWhere tax is void because levied on exempt property, remedy of purchaser at tax sale to recover money paid is under this section. McDonald v. Masonic Temple Craft, 135 Neb. 48, 280 N.W. 275 (1938).\n\nLiability of county to holder of tax sale certificate for refund upon taxes illegally assessed is solely statutory, and, if petition shows on its face that it is barred by statute of limitations, it will not stand against demurrer.

Gibson v. Dawes County, 129 Neb. 706, 262 N.W. 671 (1935).\n\nTax sale certificate must have been adjudged invalid by court of competent jurisdiction before purchaser can claim refund from county.
