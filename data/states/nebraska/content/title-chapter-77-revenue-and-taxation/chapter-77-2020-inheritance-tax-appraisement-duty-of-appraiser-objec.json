At such time and place he shall appraise the property at the fair market value of the same, and for that purpose the appraiser is authorized by leave of the court to issue subpoenas and to compel the attendance of witnesses before him, and to take the evidence of such witnesses under oath concerning such property, and the value thereof. He shall make a report thereof and of such value in writing to the court with the depositions of the witnesses and such other facts relating thereto as the court may by order require, to be filed with the records of the county court. Any person interested may file objections to such report within five days after the report is filed with the court. The judge of the county court shall examine the appraiser's report and any objections thereto, and may, at his discretion, take further evidence and shall enter an order fixing the proper appraisal of the property.\n\nSourceLaws 1901, c. 54, § 11, p. 418;Laws 1907, c. 104, § 1, p. 359;R.S.1913, § 6632;Laws 1915, c. 113, § 1, p. 262;C.S.1922, § 6163;C.S.1929, § 77-2211;R.S.1943, § 77-2020;Laws 1951, c. 269, § 1, p. 903;Laws 1976, LB 585, § 17.\n\nAnnotations\n\nFailure to file objection to appraiser's report within five days does not preclude appeal from determination of tax.
