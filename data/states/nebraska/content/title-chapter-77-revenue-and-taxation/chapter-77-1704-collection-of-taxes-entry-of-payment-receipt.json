Such entry and receipts shall bear the county name and the name of the treasurer or his or her deputy receiving the payment. Whenever it appears that any receipt for the payment of taxes is lost or destroyed, the entry so made may be read in evidence in lieu thereof. The treasurer shall enter the name of the owner or of the person paying the tax opposite each tract or lot of land when he or she collects the tax thereon and the post office address of the person paying the tax. A statement shall be entered by the treasurer on such receipt showing the amount of unpaid taxes and the date of unredeemed tax sales, if any, for the previous year or years upon such land or town lot. If the treasurer fails or neglects to note on such receipt the unpaid taxes or the date of unredeemed tax sales as provided in this section, he or she shall be liable on his or her bond to the person injured thereby in the amount of the tax so omitted.\n\nSourceLaws 1903, c. 73, § 147, p. 440;R.S.1913, § 6476;C.S.1922, § 5999;C.S.1929, § 77-1904;Laws 1937, c. 167, § 32, p. 660;Laws 1939, c. 98, § 32, p. 447;Laws 1941, c. 157, § 32, p. 631;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 77-1904;R.S.1943, § 77-1704;Laws 1992, LB 1063, § 136;Laws 1992, Second Spec.
