Without an efficient replacement of such sales tax with local sources of revenue, development within good life districts will fall short of reaching the full potential intended by the Legislature when it enacted the Good Life Transformational Projects Act, resulting in lower sales tax revenues for the state. To prevent such diminished revenues for the state and to promote local economic development where good life districts exist, local sources of revenue must be established which are tailored to meet the needs of the local community and benefit the state, if the voters in the municipality determine that it is in the best interest of their community to do so.SourceLaws 2024, LB1317, § 2.Cross ReferencesGood Life Transformational Projects Act, see section 77-4401.",
