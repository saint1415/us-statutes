In the absence of bad faith, the retailer is relieved of any further obligation to collect any additional tax on the sale of advertising and promotional direct mail; or\n\n(c) If neither subdivision (a) of this subsection nor subdivision (b) of this subsection applies, then the sale of advertising and promotional direct mail shall be sourced according to subsection (6) of section 77-2703.01.
