      "text": "77-2608.Tax Commissioner; duties; audit; discount; funds; disposition.\n\nThe Tax Commissioner shall prepare and have suitable stamps for use on each kind of piece or package of cigarettes, except when cigarette tax meter impressions are affixed. Requisition for the preparation of such stamps shall be made through the materiel division of the Department of Administrative Services as other state supplies are requisitioned, and the Tax Commissioner and his or her bondsperson shall be liable for the value of all such stamps delivered to him or her. The Auditor of Public Accounts shall audit as often as the auditor deems advisable the records of the Tax Commissioner with respect to the money received from the sale of stamps and as revenue from tax meter impressions for the purpose of determining the accuracy and correctness of the same. The Tax Commissioner shall sell or distribute the stamps only to licensed stamping agents, as provided in section 77-2603 or 77-2603.01, and the stamping agent shall keep an accurate record of all stamps coming into and leaving the stamping agent's possession. Such stamps shall be sold and accounted for at the face value thereof, except that the Tax Commissioner may, by rule and regulation certified to the State Treasurer, authorize the sale thereof to stamping agents in this state or outside of this state at a discount of one and eighty-five hundredths percent of such face value of the tax as a commission for affixing and canceling such stamps. Any stamping agent using a tax meter machine shall be entitled to the same discount as allowed a stamping agent for affixing and canceling the stamps. The money received by the Tax Commissioner from the sale of the stamps and as revenue from such tax meter impressions shall be deposited by him or her daily with the State Treasurer who shall credit such money as provided in section 77-2602. Upon proof by the Tax Commissioner that he or she can affix such stamps or meter impressions, warehouse and distribute such cigarettes, and collect such revenue at a cost less than any discount allowed to stamping agents pursuant to this section, he or she may then proceed to affix the stamps himself or herself after giving the stamping agents sixty days' notice and purchasing all equipment used by them for the purpose of affixing such stamps or meter impressions at a fair market value.\n\nSourceLaws 1947, c. 267, § 8, p. 863;Laws 1949, c. 245, § 2, p. 666;Laws 1949, c. 246, § 1, p. 668;Laws 1963, c. 458, § 2, p. 1485;Laws 1965, c. 501, § 3, p. 1596;Laws 1965, c. 500, § 2, p. 1591;Laws 1971, LB 87, § 2;Laws 1985, LB 653A, § 3;Laws 1985, Second Spec.
