Machinery or equipment does not need to come into direct physical contact with any of the raw materials, components, or products that are part of the manufacturing process to be considered manufacturing machinery or equipment.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 312, § 9;Laws 2006, LB 1189, § 4.\n\nAnnotations\n\nAny amount of use in manufacturing is sufficient to bring machinery or equipment purchased by a “person” engaged in the business of manufacturing within the definition of manufacturing machinery and equipment. Kerford Limestone Co. v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 287 Neb. 653, 844 N.W.2d 276 (2014).\n\nMotor grader’s use by limestone manufacturing company to maintain stockpiles of limestone separated according to gradation was an exempt use under this section, because such use maintained the integrity of the company’s product. Kerford Limestone Co. v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 287 Neb. 653, 844 N.W.2d 276 (2014).\n\nNo time-based qualifications are imposed upon the uses that bring machinery or equipment within the meaning of the definition of manufacturing machinery and equipment. Kerford Limestone Co. v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 287 Neb. 653, 844 N.W.2d 276 (2014).\n\nThe regulation that requires machinery and equipment to be used in manufacturing more than 50 percent of the time in order to qualify as manufacturing machinery and equipment is contrary to the plain language of this section. Kerford Limestone Co. v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 287 Neb. 653, 844 N.W.2d 276 (2014).\n\nWhether the statutory language “to maintain the integrity of the product” encompassed the specific act of maintaining inventory stockpile areas was a question of law. Kerford Limestone Co. v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 287 Neb. 653, 844 N.W.2d 276 (2014).\n\nA manufacturer was not entitled to obtain a refund of sales tax on building materials used in the construction of an ethanol production plant where the materials were purchased by an Option 3 contractor rather than by the manufacturer. Bridgeport Ethanol v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 284 Neb. 291, 818 N.W.2d 600 (2012).\n\nUnder this section and section 77-2704.22(1), the sale of manufacturing machinery and equipment includes the sale of items that are assembled to make manufacturing machinery and equipment.
