      "text": "77-2794.Income tax; overpayment; interest.\n\n(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner interest shall be allowed and paid at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted, upon any overpayment in respect to the income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section:\n\n(a) The date of overpayment shall be the last day prescribed for filing the original return of such tax;\n\n(b) Any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof, determined without regard to any extension of time to file the return, shall be considered as filed on such last day;\n\n(c) Any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any income tax withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated income tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return for the taxable year to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment, determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer;\n\n(d) If at the time an overpayment is to be refunded, the taxpayer also has a reported underpayment of the same tax in another year: (i) If the overpayment is for a taxable year ending before the year of underpayment, the overpayment shall be applied to reduce such underpayment as of the last day prescribed for filing the original return of such tax for the year of underpayment; (ii) if the overpayment is for a taxable year ending after the year of underpayment, the overpayment shall be applied to reduce such underpayment as of the last day prescribed for filing the original return of such tax for the year of overpayment; or (iii) if the overpayment is one for which interest is not allowed under this section, the overpayment shall be applied as of the date of the filing of the claim for refund; and interest shall be allowed for any remaining overpayment as provided in subdivision (a) of this subsection;\n\n(e) The period of overpayment during which interest shall be allowed shall not include any period during which the overpayment continued due to the unreasonable delay by the taxpayer in filing the claim for refund. For this purpose, the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to show that a delay of more than ninety days after all of the facts required to prepare a correct claim for refund are available is not unreasonable; and\n\n(f) The period of overpayment during which interest shall be allowed shall not include any period during which an agreement between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service was not filed as required by subsection (6) of section 77-2786 and the first ninety days after such agreement is filed.\n\n(3)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this subsection, if any overpayment of income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 is refunded within ninety days after the last date prescribed, or permitted by extension of time, for filing the return of such tax or within ninety days after any original return, and any amended return filed to carry back a loss, was filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed under this section on overpayment.\n\n(b) If the Tax Commissioner approves and implements an electronic form or method for filing the return and the return is not filed electronically, no interest shall be allowed under this section on overpayment.\n\n(c) In the case of amended returns filed for any reason other than to carry back a loss, interest shall be allowed as provided in subsection (1) of this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 487, § 94, p. 1616;Laws 1981, LB 167, § 54;Laws 1991, LB 240, § 3;Laws 1992, Fourth Spec.
