Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified service provider;\n\n(iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased; and\n\n(v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and disclosure.\n\n(e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers, including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.\n\n(f) When any personally identifiable information that has been collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no longer be retained by the member states.\n\n(g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.\n\n(h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of such request.\n\n(i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney General.\n\n(j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not enlarge or limit the state's authority to:\n\n(i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement and state law;\n\n(ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;\n\n(iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential taxpayer information;\n\n(iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the Internal Revenue Service; and\n\n(v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data for governmental purposes.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 487, § 11, p. 1566;Laws 1969, c. 683, § 7, p. 2641;Laws 1977, LB 39, § 239;Laws 1981, LB 170, § 6;Laws 1982, LB 705, § 2;Laws 1984, LB 962, § 12;Laws 1985, LB 344, § 4;Laws 1987, LB 523, § 17;Laws 1991, LB 773, § 10;Laws 1992, LB 871, § 61;Laws 1992, Fourth Spec.
