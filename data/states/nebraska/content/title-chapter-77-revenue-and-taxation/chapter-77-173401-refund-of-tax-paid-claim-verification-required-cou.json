A claim for a refund pursuant to this section shall be made in writing to the county treasurer to whom the tax was paid within three years after the date the tax was due or within ninety days after filing the amended return or the correction becomes final.\n\n(3) Before the refund is made, the county treasurer shall receive verification from the county assessor or other taxing official that such error or mistake was made, such adjustment was made, or the amended return was filed or the correction made, and the claim for refund shall be submitted to the county board. Upon verification, the county board shall approve the claim. The refund shall be made in the manner prescribed in section 77-1736.06. Such refund shall not have a dispositional effect on any similar refund for another taxpayer. This section may not be used to challenge the valuation of property, the equalization of property, or the constitutionality of a tax.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 336, § 1, p. 1173;Laws 1959, c. 373, § 1, p. 1312;Laws 1961, c. 385, § 1, p. 1179;Laws 1977, LB 245, § 1;Laws 1988, LB 819, § 1;Laws 1989, LB 762, § 2;Laws 1991, LB 829, § 12;Laws 1992, LB 719A, § 174;Laws 1999, LB 194, § 32;Laws 2008, LB965, § 17;Laws 2019, LB512, § 19.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThis section does not alter the common-law rule that taxes paid pursuant to an error of law are not recoverable.
