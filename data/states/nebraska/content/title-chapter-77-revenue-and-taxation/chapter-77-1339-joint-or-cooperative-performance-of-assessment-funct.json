Each county party to the agreement shall be represented in the procedure for choosing such assessor. No person shall be appointed assessor pursuant to an agreement who could not be so appointed for a single county. Except to the extent made necessary by the multicounty character of the assessment agency, qualifications for employment as assessor or in the assessment agency and terms and conditions of work shall be similar to those for the personnel of a single county assessment agency. Any county may include in any one or more of its employee benefit programs an assessor serving pursuant to an agreement made under this section and the employees of the assessment agency. As nearly as practicable, such inclusion shall be on the same basis as for similar employees of a single county only. An agreement providing for the joint or cooperative performance of the assessment function may provide for such assessor and employee coverage in county employee benefit programs.\n\n(5) No agreement made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall take effect until it has been approved in writing by the Tax Commissioner.\n\n(6) Copies of any agreement made pursuant to the provisions of this section, and of any amendment thereto, shall be filed in the office of the Tax Commissioner and county board of the counties involved.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 622, § 15, p. 2517;Laws 1995, LB 490, § 132;Laws 2007, LB334, § 70;Laws 2009, LB121, § 5.",
