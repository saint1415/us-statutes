VIII, sections 1 and 2, and Neb. Const. Art. III, section 18. MAPCO Ammonia Pipeline v. State Bd. of Equal., 238 Neb. 565, 471 N.W.2d 734 (1991).2. Mineral interestsA mineral interest severed from the surface ownership remains real estate but may be listed on the tax roles separate from the surface rights. If the owner of the surface rights so requests, severed mineral interests must be separately listed on the tax roles. State ex rel. Svoboda v. Weiler, 205 Neb. 799, 290 N.W.2d 456 (1980).The removal of minerals whether held in solution upon the land or resting in the soil or subsurface, is the removal of a component part of the real estate itself. The severance changes the character of the property, but it remains real estate until detached. Wheelock & Manning OO Ranches, Inc. v. Heath, 201 Neb. 835, 272 N.W.2d 768 (1978).When a mineral interest is conveyed, unless the instrument provides otherwise, an estate in fee simple or a corporeal hereditament separate from the estate in the overlying land is created. Wheelock & Manning OO Ranches, Inc. v. Heath, 201 Neb. 835, 272 N.W.2d 768 (1978).Before severance, interest in oil and gas well is taxable as real property. Conway v. County of Adams, 172 Neb. 94, 108 N.W.2d 637 (1961).Interest in mineral lease is real estate. Fawn Lake Ranch Co. v. Cumbow, 102 Neb. 288, 167 N.W. 75 (1918).3.
