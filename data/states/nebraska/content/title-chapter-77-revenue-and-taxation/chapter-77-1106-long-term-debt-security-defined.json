The qualified community development entity that issues the debt instrument may not make cash interest payments on the debt instrument during the period beginning on the date of issuance and ending on the final credit allowance date that exceed the cumulative operating income as defined by regulations adopted under section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of the qualified community development entity for that period prior to giving effect to the expense of such cash interest payments. This in no way limits the holder's ability to accelerate payments on the debt instrument if the issuer has defaulted on covenants designed to ensure compliance with this section or section 45D of the code.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB1128, § 6.",
