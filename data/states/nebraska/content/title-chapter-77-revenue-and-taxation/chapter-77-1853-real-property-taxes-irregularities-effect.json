Collier v. County of Logan, 169 Neb. 1, 97 N.W.2d 879 (1959).\n\nIrregularity in certification of special assessment did not invalidate tax. Belza v. Village of Emerson, 159 Neb. 651, 68 N.W.2d 272 (1955).\n\nConsideration by county assessor of valuations made by others was an irregularity that did not invalidate tax. Gamboni v. County of Otoe, 159 Neb. 417, 67 N.W.2d 489 (1954).\n\nIn absence of proof to contrary, it will be presumed that taxing authorities discharged all duties imposed upon them. Adams v.

Helmer, 10 Neb. 65, 4 N.W. 968 (1880).\n\nFact that taxes are illegal in part does not invalidate sale, and sale operates as assignment of lien. Hall v. Moore, 3 Neb. Unof. 574, 92 N.W. 294 (1902).\n\nCounty assessor's assessment of mobile homes on different ledger pages from the underlying property is at most a mere irregularity and does not affect the validity of the taxes or subsequent liens on the underlying property.
