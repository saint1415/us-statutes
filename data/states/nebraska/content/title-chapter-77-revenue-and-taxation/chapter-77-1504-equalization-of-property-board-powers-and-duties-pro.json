Power of county board\n\nPower of county board of equalization to rectify returns and change assessments is limited to a set number of circumscribed days each year. County board of equalization does not have jurisdiction to decrease the challenged assessed personal property values. County board of equalization is statutorily empowered and authorized to equalize only those assessments of countywide property of which the county has the authority to assess the value. John Day Co. v. Douglas Cty. Bd. of Equal., 243 Neb. 24, 497 N.W.2d 65 (1993).\n\nIt is the function of the county board of equalization to determine the actual value of locally assessed property for tax purposes. In carrying out this function, the county board must give effect to the constitutional requirement that taxes be levied uniformly and proportionately upon all taxable property in the county. Individual discrepancies and inequalities within the county must be corrected and equalized by the county board of equalization. AT&T Information Sys. v. State Bd. of Equal., 237 Neb. 591, 467 N.W.2d 55 (1991).\n\nThis section provides for equalizing value of real estate of individual taxpayer. Fromkin v. State, 158 Neb. 377, 63 N.W.2d 332 (1954).\n\nCounty boards of equalization deal with assessments of individuals and between townships, precincts or districts within county. Scotts Bluff County v. State Board of Equalization and Assessment, 143 Neb. 837, 11 N.W.2d 453 (1943).\n\nCounty board of equalization has no authority to increase the valuation of an assessment of all the real estate in a precinct in the absence of a finding that the valuation of such real estate does not bear a just relation to the valuation of the real estate in all townships, precincts or districts in the county. Peterson v. Brunzell, 103 Neb. 250, 170 N.W. 905 (1919).\n\n2. Procedures\n\nNotice to owner of intention to raise valuation is required. Gamboni v. County of Otoe, 159 Neb. 417, 67 N.W.2d 489 (1954).\n\nWhen taxpayer claims that real estate is assessed too high, he should first apply for relief to board of equalization, and, if denied, should appeal to the courts. Power v. Jones, 126 Neb. 529, 253 N.W. 867 (1934).\n\nThe several owners of different tracts of land may unite in petition for relief. State ex rel. Mellor v. Grow, 74 Neb. 850, 105 N.W. 898 (1905).\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\nThis section and section 77-1502 were not repealed by section 77-1358. Banner County v. State Bd. of Equal., 226 Neb. 236, 411 N.W.2d 35 (1987).\n\nA decree of court fixing the value of real estate on a previous assessment is not competent evidence in a further suit affecting the assessment value of the property in a subsequent year.
