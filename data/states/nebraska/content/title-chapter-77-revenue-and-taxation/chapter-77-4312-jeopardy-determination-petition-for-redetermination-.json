      "text": "77-4312.Jeopardy determination; petition for redetermination; procedure; deficiency; interest; seized property; sale; when; procedure; return of property; conditions; injunction; Tax Commissioner; powers.\n\n(1) Any person who receives a notice of jeopardy determination of the tax imposed by section 77-4303 may petition the Tax Commissioner for a redetermination of the amount of the assessed deficiency.\n\n(2) The petition for redetermination shall be filed within ten days of the receipt of the notice of jeopardy determination whenever service is in person or within ten days of the mailing of such notice to the last-known address of the person.\n\n(3) The petition for redetermination shall be in writing and shall state the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded.\n\n(4) The petition for redetermination shall be accompanied by the payment of the tax or suitable security for the payment of the tax.\n\n(5) The consideration of the petition for redetermination shall be made pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act to the extent the act is not in conflict with sections 77-4301 to 77-4316.\n\n(6) The determination of the amount of the deficiency shall become final and the amount shall be deemed to be assessed on the date provided in subsection (2) of this section if the person fails to file the petition for the redetermination and the appropriate security within the ten-day time period.\n\n(7) When a petition for redetermination and the appropriate security is filed within the ten-day period, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date the determination of the Tax Commissioner becomes final.\n\n(8) If the amount of the deficiency determined under such sections is not paid upon the receipt of the notice, the deficiency shall accrue interest at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted, for the period from the date the tax was due until the date such deficiency is paid.\n\n(9)(a) When a jeopardy determination or any other final determination has been made by the Tax Commissioner, the property seized for collection of the taxes and any penalty shall not be sold until the time has expired for filing an appeal. If an appeal has been filed, no sale shall be made unless the taxes and any penalty remain unpaid for a period of more than thirty days after final determination of the appeal by the district court.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this subsection, seized property may be sold if the taxpayer consents in writing to the sale or the Tax Commissioner determines that the property is perishable or may become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping or that such property cannot be kept without great expense.\n\n(c) The property seized shall be returned by the Tax Commissioner if the owner gives a surety bond equal to the appraised value of the owner's interest in the property, as determined by the Tax Commissioner, or deposits with the Tax Commissioner security in such form and amount as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary to insure payment of the liability but not more than twice the liability.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if a levy or sale pursuant to this section would irreparably injure rights in property which the court determines to be superior to rights of the state in such property, the district court may grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of such levy or to prohibit such sale.\n\n(e) Any action taken by the Tax Commissioner pursuant to this section shall not constitute an election by the state to pursue a remedy to the exclusion of any other remedy.\n\n(f) After the Tax Commissioner has seized the property of any person, that person may, upon giving forty-eight hours notice to the Tax Commissioner and to the court, bring a claim for equitable relief before the district court for the release of the property to the taxpayer upon such terms and conditions as the court deems equitable.\n\n(10) If the taxpayer ignores all demands for payment, the Tax Commissioner may employ the services of any qualified collection agency or attorney and pay fees for such services out of any money recovered.\n\nSourceLaws 1990, LB 260, § 12;Laws 1991, LB 773, § 34;Laws 1992, Fourth Spec. Sess., LB 1, § 40;Laws 1993, LB 161, § 5;Laws 2012, LB727, § 52.\n\nCross ReferencesAdministrative Procedure Act, see section 84-920.\n\nAnnotations\n\nBecause subsection (4) of this section requires the payment of the assessed drug tax or posting of a suitable security for the tax as a jurisdictional prerequisite for a redetermination hearing without furnishing other means for indigents to obtain a hearing, subsection (4) as applied to indigent individuals is unconstitutional. Further, subsection (4) is an unconstitutional and invalid delegation of legislative authority and power to an executive or administrative officer of the state. Boll v. Department of Revenue, 247 Neb. 473, 528 N.W.2d 300 (1995).",
