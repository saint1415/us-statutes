Loup County v. Rumbaugh, 151 Neb. 563, 38 N.W.2d 745 (1949).\n\nRemedy is furnished to compel payment of judgments secured against governmental subdivisions. Madison County v. School Dist. No. 2, 148 Neb. 218, 27 N.W.2d 172 (1947).\n\nBy providing a method of payment of judgment against county, policy of state is shown that judgment should not be a lien on specific county property.
