All fees, mileage, and commissions shall be taxed to the parties against whom the distress warrants run and shall be collected as the original tax. When the taxes are not collected by distress and sale, the mileage shall be paid as provided in section 33-117. When mileage has been paid as provided in section 33-117 and the tax, together with all fees, mileage, and commission are collected, then the amount collected as mileage shall be paid to the county treasurer with the fees and commission and credited by the county treasurer to the general fund of the county.\n\nSourceLaws 1903, c. 73, § 156, p. 444;R.S.1913, § 6485;C.S.1922, § 6012;C.S.1929, § 77-1917;R.S.1943, § 77-1720;Laws 1947, c. 123, § 2, p. 361;Laws 1951, c. 266, § 2, p. 897;Laws 1957, c. 70, § 7, p. 300;Laws 1959, c. 84, § 4, p. 387;Laws 1965, c. 493, § 1, p. 1579;Laws 1981, LB 204, § 151;Laws 1989, LB 324, § 1.\n\nAnnotations\n\nUnder former law, sheriff could not charge fee for a return upon distress warrant, \"No property found\".
