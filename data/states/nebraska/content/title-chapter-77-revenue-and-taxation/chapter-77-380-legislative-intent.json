The Legislature recognizes that the present budgeting system fails to accurately and totally reflect the revenue lost due to such tax expenditures and that as a result undetermined amounts of potential revenue are escaping public or legislative scrutiny. The loss of such potential revenue causes a narrowing of the tax base which in turn forces higher tax rates on the remaining tax base.\n\nSourceLaws 1979, LB 17, § 2;R.S.Supp.,1979, § 77-354;Laws 1980, LB 834, § 21.",
