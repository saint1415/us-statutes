In re Estate of Morse, 241 Neb. 40, 486 N.W.2d 195 (1992).\n\nThe Legislature may properly distinguish inheritance tax laws in favor of blood relations, since such distinction is neither arbitrary nor unconstitutionally ambiguous. Ralston v. County of Dawson, 200 Neb. 678, 264 N.W.2d 868 (1978).\n\nA more burdensome tax is imposed in the case of named remote relatives by blood or legal adoption. Todd v.
