Such industries shall include, but are not limited to, transportation, broadcast communications, and insurance.\n\n(4) If the Tax Commissioner fails to mail a notice of final action on any petition under the provisions of this section within thirty days after the filing of such petition, the taxpayer may, prior to notice of action on the petition, consider the petition denied.\n\nSourceLaws 1984, LB 1124, § 18;Laws 1985, LB 273, § 59.",
