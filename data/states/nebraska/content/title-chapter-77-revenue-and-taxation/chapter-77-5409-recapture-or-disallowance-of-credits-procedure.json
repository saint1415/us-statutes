One-seventh of the credits used shall be recaptured and one-seventh of the remaining carryovers shall be disallowed for each year the taxpayer did not maintain such project at or above the required levels of employment, wages, or investment.\n\n(3) Any reduction in tax due, to the extent required to be recaptured, shall be deemed to be an underpayment of the tax and shall be immediately due and payable. When tax benefits were received in more than one year, the tax benefits received in the most recent year shall be recovered first and then the benefits received in earlier years up to the extent of the required recapture.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in the laws of this state, collections of any taxes deemed to be underpayments by this section shall be allowed for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement or three years after the end of the entitlement period, whichever is later.\n\n(5) Any amounts due under this section shall be recaptured notwithstanding other allowable credits and shall not be subsequently refunded under any provision of the act unless the recapture was in error.\n\n(6) The recapture required by this section shall not occur if the failure to maintain the required levels of employment, wages, or investment was caused by an act of God or national emergency.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 936, § 9.",
