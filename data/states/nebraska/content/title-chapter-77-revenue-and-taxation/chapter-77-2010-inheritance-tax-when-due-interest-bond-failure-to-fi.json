In addition, for failure to file an appropriate proceeding for the determination of the tax within twelve months after the date of the death of the decedent there shall be added to the amount due a penalty of five percent per month or fraction thereof, up to a maximum penalty of twenty-five percent of the unpaid taxes due. The filing of a petition or an application for probate proceedings or the filing of an application under section 77-2018.07 and payment of the tentative tax payment within twelve months of the decedent's death shall be considered an appropriate proceeding for the determination to avoid a penalty and to stop the accrual of a penalty. In addition, the county court may abate this penalty if good cause is shown for failure to file.\n\nSourceLaws 1901, c. 54, § 3, p. 416;Laws 1911, c. 107, § 1, p. 386;R.S.1913, § 6624;C.S.1922, § 6155;C.S.1929, § 77-2203;R.S.1943, § 77-2010;Laws 1951, c. 267, § 5, p. 901;Laws 1976, LB 585, § 10;Laws 1978, LB 650, § 29;Laws 1981, LB 167, § 48;Laws 2007, LB502, § 4;Laws 2009, LB120, § 1.\n\nAnnotations\n\nDelay caused by litigation does not excuse county judge from assessing tax as of date of death.
