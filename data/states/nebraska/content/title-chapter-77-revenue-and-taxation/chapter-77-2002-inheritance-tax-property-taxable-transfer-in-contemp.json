This subsection shall not apply if the decedent's estate is the beneficiary of the trust.\n\nSourceLaws 1901, c. 54, § 1, p. 414;Laws 1905, c. 117, § 1, p. 523;Laws 1907, c. 103, § 1, p. 356;R.S.1913, § 6622;C.S.1922, § 6153;Laws 1923, c. 187, § 1, p. 430;C.S.1929, § 77-2201;Laws 1931, c. 132, § 1, p. 371;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 77-2201;R.S.1943, § 77-2002;Laws 1945, c. 198, § 4, p. 604;Laws 1947, c. 263, § 1, p. 853;Laws 1951, c. 267, § 2, p. 899;Laws 1953, c. 282, § 1, p. 913;Laws 1955, c. 299, § 1, p. 935;Laws 1976, LB 585, § 2;Laws 1982, LB 480, § 2;Laws 1995, LB 574, § 66;Laws 2019, LB315, § 1.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIn determining whether to impose inheritance tax under subdivision (1)(b) of this section on a transferred interest in property, a court must consider all the surrounding circumstances of the transfer rather than simply the form of the transferring legal documents, in order to determine if a decedent intended, as a matter of fact rather than a technical vesting of title or estates, to retain a substantial economic benefit or actual use of the property until death. In re Estate of Lofgreen, 312 Neb. 937, 981 N.W.2d 585 (2022).\n\nCosts and attorney's fees in litigation independent of the estate are not deductible in inheritance tax proceedings.

Triska, 168 Neb. 1, 95 N.W.2d 350 (1959).\n\nContract subscribing money to college endowment and for scholarship payable on subscriber's death was donative and money thereby transferred therefor was taxable. In re Wheeler's Estate, 119 Neb. 344, 228 N.W. 861 (1930).\n\nLands, conveyed by deed in which grantor retained life estate and land conveyed by absolute deeds delivered after grantor's death not intended to take effect previously in possession or enjoyment, may be subject to inheritance tax. In re Estate of Bronzynski, 116 Neb. 196, 216 N.W. 558 (1927).",
