The Tax Commissioner may refuse to issue a letter ruling for good cause, but shall list the specific reasons for refusing to issue the letter ruling. Good cause includes, but is not limited to:\n\n(a) The applicant requests the Tax Commissioner to determine whether a statute is constitutional or a rule or regulation is lawful;\n\n(b) The request involves a hypothetical situation or alternative plans;\n\n(c) The facts or issues presented in the request are unclear, overbroad, insufficient, or otherwise inappropriate as a basis upon which to issue a letter ruling; or\n\n(d) The issue is currently being considered in a rulemaking procedure, contested case, or other agency or judicial proceeding that may definitely resolve the issue.\n\n(3) A letter ruling shall bind the Tax Commissioner until such time as the taxpayer or its shareholders, members, or partners, as applicable, claim all of such tax credits on a tax return which is the topic of the letter ruling, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in rules and regulations. The letter ruling shall apply only to the applicant.\n\n(4) In rendering letter rulings and making other determinations under this section, to the extent applicable, the Tax Commissioner shall look for guidance to section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder. The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this section.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB1128, § 19.",
