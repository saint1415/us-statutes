Service of notice\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Service of notice\n\nA strict compliance by the tax sale purchaser with the statutes, not only as to the service of the notice, but also as to the proof of such service, must be reflected by the record before the county treasurer is clothed with authority to issue a tax deed. Castillo v. Libert Land Holdings 4, 316 Neb. 287, 4 N.W.3d 377 (2024).\n\nIn subsection (1)(a) of this section, personal service means service made by leaving the notice with the individual to be served, and residence service means service made by leaving the notice at the usual place of residence of the individual to be served, with some person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. Castillo v. Libert Land Holdings 4, 316 Neb. 287, 4 N.W.3d 377 (2024).\n\nUnder section 77-1831, this section, and section 77-1834, the Legislature intended that notice of intent to apply for a treasurer's tax deed be given by personal or residence service both upon a person in actual possession or occupancy of the real property and upon the person in whose name the title to the real property appears of record who can be found in this state. Castillo v. Libert Land Holdings 4, 316 Neb. 287, 4 N.W.3d 377 (2024).\n\nUnder this section, notice may be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address where the property tax statement is mailed. HBI, L.L.C. v. Barnette, 305 Neb. 457, 941 N.W.2d 158 (2020).\n\nUnder this section, service need only be provided to the owner of record at the address where the property tax statement was mailed and may only be done by certified mail, return receipt requested. Wisner v. Vandelay Investments, 300 Neb. 825, 916 N.W.2d 698 (2018).\n\nNotice to a sanitary improvement district, as titleholder to five parcels of real estate, of pending issuance of tax deeds to a holder of tax certificates on those parcels was sufficient under this section where a real estate transfer form designated the address of the district's attorney as the address where tax statements should be sent; the certificate holder sent redemption notices by certified mail, receipt requested, to that address; and the certificate holder provided affidavits of service and proof of publication to the county treasurer when applying for the tax deeds. SID No. 424 v. Tristar Mgmt., 288 Neb. 425, 850 N.W.2d 745 (2014).\n\nService of notice must be made upon the person in whose name the title appears of record, and upon occupant in possession. Kuska v. Kubat, 147 Neb. 139, 22 N.W.2d 484 (1946).\n\nPersonal service is not necessary if owner dead. Sanford v. Scott, 105 Neb. 479, 181 N.W. 148 (1920).\n\nNotice must be served on person in whose name assessed, and failure to serve notice or show necessity for service by publication renders subsequent proceedings void. Howell v. Jordan, 94 Neb. 264, 143 N.W. 217 (1913).\n\nNotice to actual occupant is essential. Parsons v. Prudential R. E. Co., 86 Neb. 271, 125 N.W. 521 (1910).\n\nService of notice is not essential to foreclosure of lien by purchaser. Carman v. Harris, 61 Neb. 635, 85 N.W. 848 (1901); Merrill v. Ijams, 58 Neb. 706, 79 N.W. 734 (1899).\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\nActual occupancy or possession means such occupancy or possession as would put an ordinarily prudent man on notice by observation of the premises involved. Thomas v. Flynn, 169 Neb. 458, 100 N.W.2d 37 (1959).",
