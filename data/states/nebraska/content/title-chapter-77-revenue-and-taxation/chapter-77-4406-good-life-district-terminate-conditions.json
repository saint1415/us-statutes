The department shall accept evidence of such commitments from any source so long as the evidence relates to any portion of the project described in the application, as amended or supplemented. Certification by the city or village in which all or a portion of the good life district is located that the evidence submitted represents commitments for investment in the project described in the application shall be conclusive and accepted by the department, and such commitments shall be counted toward the applicable threshold. Any such certification by a city or village shall not limit or restrict the department's acceptance of evidence of commitments from the good life district applicant or any other source.\n\n(3) The department may terminate a good life district prior to the establishment of a good life district economic development program pursuant to section 77-4412 upon the request of the good life district applicant. For any good life district that has one or more project areas, such termination may also be requested by the city or village in which all or a portion of the good life district is located.\n\n(4)(a) Any termination of a good life district pursuant to this section shall require the recapture of any unencumbered amounts remaining in a good life district economic development fund established under section 77-4414 for the good life district being terminated. Such amounts shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the General Fund.\n\n(b) The recapture required by this subsection shall not occur if the failure to meet the requirements in subsection (1) of this section was caused by an act of God or a national emergency.\n\nSourceLaws 2023, LB727, § 14;Laws 2024, LB1317, § 91;Laws 2025, LB707, § 6.Effective Date: June 5, 2025",
