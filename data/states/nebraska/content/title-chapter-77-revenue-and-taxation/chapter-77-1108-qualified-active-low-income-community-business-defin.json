      "text": "77-1108.Qualified active low-income community business, defined.\n\nQualified active low-income community business has the meaning given such term in section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and 26 C.F.R. 1.45D-1. A business shall be considered a qualified active low-income community business for the duration of the qualified community development entity's investment in, or loan to, the business if the entity reasonably expects, at the time it makes the investment or loan, that the business will continue to satisfy the requirements for being a qualified active low-income community business throughout the entire period of the investment or loan. The term excludes any business that derives or projects to derive fifteen percent or more of its annual revenue from the rental or sale of real estate. This exclusion does not apply to a business that is controlled by, or under common control with, another business if the second business (1) does not derive or project to derive fifteen percent or more of its annual revenue from the rental or sale of real estate and (2) is the primary tenant of the real estate leased from the first business.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB1128, § 8.",
