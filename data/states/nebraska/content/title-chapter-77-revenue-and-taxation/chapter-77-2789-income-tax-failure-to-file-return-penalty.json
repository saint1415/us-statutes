For purposes of this section, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.\n\n(2) In case of each failure to file a statement of payment to another person, including the duplicate statement of tax withheld on wages, on the date prescribed therefor, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing, unless it is shown that such failure is the result of reasonable cause and not willful neglect, the Tax Commissioner may assess a penalty against the person so failing to file the statement, in the amount of two dollars for each statement not so filed but the total amount imposed on the delinquent person for all such failure during any calendar year shall not exceed two thousand dollars.\n\n(3) In case of failure to file any return for income tax withheld on the date prescribed therefor, determined with regard to any extension of time to file, the Tax Commissioner may add to the amount required to be shown as tax on such return twenty-five dollars or the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section, whichever is greater.\n\n(4) All determinations made by the Tax Commissioner under subsection (3) of this section are due and payable at the time they become final. If they are not paid when final, a penalty of ten percent of the total amount due, exclusive of interest and other penalties, shall be added to the total amount due.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 487, § 89, p. 1610;Laws 1993, LB 345, § 68;Laws 2010, LB879, § 12.",
