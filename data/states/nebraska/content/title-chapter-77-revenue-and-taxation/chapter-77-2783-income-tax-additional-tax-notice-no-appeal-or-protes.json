Such a notice of additional tax due shall not be considered a notice of deficiency assessment nor shall the taxpayer have any right of protest or appeal as in the case of a deficiency assessment based on such notice, and the assessment and collection of the amount of tax erroneously omitted in the return is not prohibited. For purposes of this section, mathematical or clerical error includes information on the taxpayer's return that is different from information reported to the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax Commissioner, including, but not limited to, information reported on Form W-2 and Form 1099.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 487, § 83, p. 1606;Laws 2017, LB217, § 17.",
