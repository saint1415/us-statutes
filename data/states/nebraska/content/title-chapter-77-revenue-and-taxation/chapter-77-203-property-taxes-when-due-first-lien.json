First lien\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n1. First lien\n\nAll general real property taxes are a first lien. Polenz v. City of Ravenna, 145 Neb. 845, 18 N.W.2d 510 (1945).\n\nLien of taxes is not satisfied by statutory sale of property, but the sale only operates to transfer the lien to the purchaser. Coffin v. Old Line Life Ins. Co., 138 Neb. 857, 295 N.W. 884 (1941).\n\nSpecial assessments are subsequent to general taxes in distribution of proceeds of tax foreclosure sale. Douglas County v. Shannon, 125 Neb. 783, 252 N.W. 199 (1934).\n\nSince taxes are required to be paid and are a first lien on land, agreement to pay taxes and highest rate of interest is usurious and invalidates mortgage to extent of usury. Matthews v. Guenther, 120 Neb. 742, 235 N.W. 98 (1931).\n\nTaxes take precedence over all other liens. Merriam v. Goodlett, 36 Neb. 384, 54 N.W. 686 (1893); Mutual Ben. Life Ins. Co. v. Siefken, 1 Neb. Unof. 860, 96 N.W. 603 (1901).\n\nLien of taxes due to county was inferior to perfected loan of agency of United States. United States v. Hauff, 267 F.Supp. 390 (D. Neb. 1966).\n\nProceeds of sale of real estate of bankrupt corporation were allocated first to county for real estate taxes. In re Independent Truckers, Inc., 226 F.Supp. 440 (D. Neb. 1963).\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\nUnder this section, property tax liability is not determinable or chargeable until December 31 following the prior year. Under this section, property tax liability is not apportionable between the real estate life tenant and the remaindermen. In re Estate of Olsen, 254 Neb. 809, 579 N.W.2d 529 (1998).\n\nWhere right to levy certain taxes is clearly conferred on cities of metropolitan class, such cities may supply the details necessary for full exercise of such power. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. v. Bauman, 132 Neb. 67, 271 N.W. 256 (1937).\n\nLife tenant should pay taxes on land during continuance of his estate. Spiech v. Tierney, 56 Neb. 514, 76 N.W. 1090 (1898).",
