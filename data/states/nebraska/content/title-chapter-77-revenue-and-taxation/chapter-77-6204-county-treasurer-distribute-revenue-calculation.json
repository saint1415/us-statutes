A local taxing entity's status as eligible for distribution under such subdivision shall be affected by the disposal of all of the exempt depreciable personal property used directly in the generation of electricity using wind, solar, biomass, or landfill gas as the fuel source.\n\n(3) The distribution to each eligible local taxing entity under subdivision (1)(b) of this section shall be calculated by determining the amount of taxes that the eligible local taxing entity levied during the taxable year and dividing this amount by the total tax levied by all of the eligible local taxing entities during the year. Each eligible entity's resulting fraction shall then be multiplied by the amount of revenue available for distribution pursuant to subdivision (1)(b) of this section to determine the portion of such revenue due each local taxing entity.\n\n(4) The Department of Revenue shall not retain any revenue collected pursuant to sections 77-6201 to 77-6204 for distribution, use, transfer, pledge, or allocation to or from the General Fund.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB1048, § 15;Laws 2015, LB424, § 7;Laws 2025, LB50, § 1.Effective Date: September 3, 2025",
