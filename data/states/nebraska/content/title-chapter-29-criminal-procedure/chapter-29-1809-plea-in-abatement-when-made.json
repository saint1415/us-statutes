      "text": "29-1809.Plea in abatement; when made.\n\nA plea in abatement may be made when there is a defect in the record which is shown by facts extrinsic thereto.\n\nSourceG.S.1873, c. 58, § 441, p. 822;R.S.1913, § 9085;C.S.1922, § 10110;C.S.1929, § 29-1808;R.S.1943, § 29-1809.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1. When made\n\n2. Procedure\n\n1. When made\n\nHereafter the sufficiency of the evidence at a preliminary hearing may be raised only by a plea in abatement filed in the criminal proceeding in the district court. Kruger v. Brainard, 183 Neb. 455, 161 N.W.2d 520 (1968).\n\nA plea in abatement may be made when there is a defect in the record which is shown by facts extrinsic thereto. Svehla v. State, 168 Neb. 553, 96 N.W.2d 649 (1959).\n\nPlea in abatement presenting questions of law only is properly determined by court. Hardin v. State, 92 Neb. 298, 138 N.W. 146 (1912).\n\nObjections to empaneling of grand jury may be presented by plea in abatement. If plea is made, and no refusal to rule thereon by trial court is shown, objection is waived. Goldsberry v. State, 92 Neb. 211, 137 N.W. 1116 (1912).\n\nPlea in abatement is proper where there is defect in record shown by extrinsic facts. In case stated, plea is not good. Steiner v. State, 78 Neb. 147, 110 N.W. 723 (1907).\n\nWhether preliminary hearing has been had or waived may be determined by interposition of plea in abatement. Jahnke v. State, 68 Neb. 154, 94 N.W. 158 (1903), reversed on rehearing 68 Neb. 181, 104 N.W. 154 (1905).\n\nA plea in abatement based upon the fact that defendant had two preliminary examinations, and that on the first he was held for a lower grade of offense than upon the one which is the basis of the information filed against him is demurrable. Thompson v. State, 61 Neb. 210, 85 N.W. 62 (1901).\n\nMatters triable under plea of not guilty cannot be presented by plea in abatement. State v. Bailey, 57 Neb. 204, 77 N.W. 654 (1898).\n\nObjections on grounds of variance of information from complaint should be made by plea in abatement. Whitner v. State, 46 Neb. 144, 64 N.W. 704 (1895).\n\n2. Procedure\n\nAfter trial and conviction in the district court, any error in the ruling of the district court on the plea in abatement is cured if the evidence at trial is sufficient to permit the jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Franklin, 194 Neb. 630, 234 N.W.2d 610 (1975).\n\nIssue on plea in abatement was properly tried by the court without a jury. Bolln v. State, 51 Neb. 581, 71 N.W. 444 (1897).\n\nWhere plea in bar is good, issue raised by it and state's reply must be tried by jury. Arnold v. State, 38 Neb. 752, 57 N.W. 378 (1894).\n\nRuling on plea in abatement is not a final order. Gartner v. State, 36 Neb. 280, 54 N.W. 516 (1893).\n\nPlea may be signed by prisoner's attorney; if verified by prisoner, it is sufficient. Bohanan v. State, 15 Neb. 209, 18 N.W. 129 (1884).\n\nPlea must point out particular cause of illegality. Baldwin v. State, 12 Neb. 61, 10 N.W. 463 (1881).\n\nPlea in abatement must state facts and not legal conclusions. Priest v. State, 10 Neb. 393, 6 N.W. 468 (1880).\n\nWhere allegations of plea in abatement are denied by state, burden of proof is on defendant. Everson v. State, 4 Neb. Unof. 109, 93 N.W. 394 (1903).",
