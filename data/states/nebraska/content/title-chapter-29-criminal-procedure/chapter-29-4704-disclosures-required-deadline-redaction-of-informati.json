If the prosecutor seeks to introduce the testimony of a jailhouse informant that was not known until after such deadline, or if the information described in subsection (1) of this section could not have been discovered or obtained by the prosecutor with the exercise of due diligence at least thirty days before the trial or other criminal proceeding, the court may permit the prosecutor to disclose the information as soon as is practicable after the thirty-day period.\n\n(3) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that disclosing information listed in subsection (1) of this section will result in the possibility of bodily harm to a jailhouse informant or that a jailhouse informant will be coerced, the court may permit the prosecutor to redact some or all of such information.\n\n(4) If, at any time subsequent to the deadline in subsection (2) of this section, the prosecutor discovers additional material required to be disclosed under subsection (1) of this section, the prosecutor shall promptly:\n\n(a) Notify the court of the existence of the additional material; and\n\n(b) Disclose such material to the defense, except as provided in subsection (3) of this section.\n\nSourceLaws 2019, LB352, § 4.",
