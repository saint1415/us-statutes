State v. Wilson, 306 Neb. 875, 947 N.W.2d 704 (2020).When a defendant pleads to an offense, such as first degree sexual assault pursuant to section 28-319, where the term \"aggravated offense\" is not a specifically included element of the offense, in order for lifetime community supervision to apply, a jury would need to find that the defendant had committed an aggravated offense, or the defendant must plead separately to the commission of an aggravated offense. State v. Nelson, 27 Neb. App. 748, 936 N.W.2d 32 (2019).To constitute \"direct genital touching\" for purposes of finding an aggravated offense under this section, there must be evidence that the actor touched the victim's genitals under the victim's clothing. State v. Kresha, 25 Neb. App. 543, 909 N.W.2d 93 (2018).",
