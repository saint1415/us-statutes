An accused may, also, when there is not sufficient evidence to put him upon his defense, be discharged by the court; or, if not discharged by the court, shall be entitled to the immediate verdict of the jury, for the purpose of giving evidence for others accused with him. Such order of discharge in either case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense.\n\nSourceG.S.1873, c. 58, § 474, p. 827;R.S.1913, § 9115;C.S.1922, § 10140;C.S.1929, § 29-2012;R.S.1943, § 29-2012.\n\nAnnotations\n\nWhen separate trials are awarded to parties jointly indicted, each is a competent witness for the state upon the trial of other, without being first acquitted, and without entry of nolle prosequi.
