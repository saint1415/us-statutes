However, if a victim brings suit against an advocate or the agency, business, or organization in which the advocate was employed or served as a volunteer at the time of the advocacy relationship, the advocate may testify or produce records regarding confidential communications with the victim and is not in violation of sections 29-4301 to 29-4304.\n\n(3) Sections 29-4301 to 29-4304 shall not relieve an advocate of any duty to report suspected adult abuse or neglect as required by section 28-372 or suspected child abuse or neglect as required by section 28-711 or any other legal duty to report a criminal or unlawful act.\n\n(4) Sections 29-4301 to 29-4304 shall not be construed to limit any other testimonial privilege available to any person under the laws of this state.\n\nSourceLaws 2004, LB 613, § 4.",
