Sentence of defendant\n\n2. Suspension of execution of sentence\n\n3. Power of court\n\n4. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Sentence of defendant\n\nSentence vacated because defendant not present at sentencing even though his absence was by choice. State v. Ernest, 200 Neb. 615, 264 N.W.2d 677 (1978).\n\nIn absence of showing of prejudice, it is not error to sentence defendant before time for filing motion for new trial has expired. Young v. State, 155 Neb. 261, 51 N.W.2d 326 (1952).\n\nWhere conviction is had on each of separate counts charging same offense, single sentence is rendered upon all counts for one entire offense. Yeoman v. State, 81 Neb. 244, 115 N.W. 784 (1908).\n\nJudgment imposing sentence will not be interfered with as being excessive in absence of clear abuse of discretion. Wright v. State, 45 Neb. 44, 63 N.W. 147 (1895); Morrison v. State, 13 Neb. 527, 14 N.W. 475 (1882).\n\nSeparate sentence should be passed on each count of indictment charging separate misdemeanors of same kind upon which defendant is found guilty. Burrell v.

Rohnert, 179 Neb. 727, 140 N.W.2d 9 (1966).\n\n3.

Miscellaneous\n\nA sentence validly imposed takes effect from the time it is pronounced, and a subsequent, different sentence is a nullity. State v. Kinney, 217 Neb. 701, 350 N.W.2d 552 (1984).\n\nFailure to comply with this section does not affect the jurisdiction of the court, and is not ground for release on habeas corpus. Dunham v. O'Grady, 137 Neb. 649, 290 N.W. 723 (1940).\n\nIn recording judgment, clerk should follow substantially formal language of court. Preuit v. The People, 5 Neb. 377 (1877).",
