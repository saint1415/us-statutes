State v. Kula, 262 Neb. 787, 635 N.W.2d 252 (2001).\n\nThe independent act considered herein is not unconstitutional for failure to mention in the incidental provision for payment or exemption from payment of costs, nor for failing to refer to and repeal certain other statutes. State ex rel. Douglas v. Gradwohl, 194 Neb. 745, 235 N.W.2d 854 (1975).\n\nDefendant is liable for only such costs made by state as there was actual, apparent or probable necessity for incurring, and is limited to costs incurred in establishing his guilt. Biester v. State, 65 Neb. 276, 91 N.W. 416 (1902).\n\nIt is the duty of court, upon conviction, to render judgment for costs of prosecution; may sentence defendant to imprisonment in county jail until costs are paid or security for payment is given. In re Newton, 39 Neb. 757, 58 N.W. 436 (1894); In re Dobson, 37 Neb. 449, 55 N.W. 1071 (1893).\n\nCosts in criminal proceedings are the charges fixed by statute necessarily incurred in the prosecution of one charged with a public offense as compensation to the officers for their services.
