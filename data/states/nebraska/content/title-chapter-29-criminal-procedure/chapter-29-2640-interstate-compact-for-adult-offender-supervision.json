      "text": "29-2640.Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision.\n\nThe Governor is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of this state with any other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nThe compacting states solemnly agree:\n\nARTICLE I PURPOSE\n\nThe compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: Create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, or corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purposes of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, and state criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulation of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefor public business.\n\nARTICLE II DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\nAdult means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute, or operation of law;\n\nBylaws means those bylaws established by the interstate commission for its governance or for directing or controlling the interstate commission's actions or conduct;\n\nCompact administrator means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the interstate commission, and the policies adopted by the state council under this compact;\n\nCompacting state means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;\n\nCommissioner means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact;\n\nInterstate commission means the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision established by this compact;\n\nMember means the commissioner of a compacting state or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the commissioner;\n\nNoncompacting state means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;\n\nOffender means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies;\n\nPerson means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private;\n\nRules means acts of the interstate commission, duly promulgated pursuant to Article VIII of this compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the interstate commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states;\n\nState means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any other territorial possessions of the United States; and\n\nState Council means the resident members of the State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision created by each state under Article IV of this compact.\n\nARTICLE III THE COMPACT COMMISSION\n\nThe compacting states hereby create the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.

The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.
