State v. Buttner, 180 Neb. 529, 143 N.W.2d 907 (1966).\n\nFailure to demur is not a waiver where information wholly fails to allege essential element of crime. Nelson v. State, 167 Neb. 575, 94 N.W.2d 1 (1959).\n\nDemurrer would not lie to indictment because it alleged in detail facts leading up to commission of criminal act charged. Kirchman v. State, 122 Neb. 624, 241 N.W. 100 (1932).",
