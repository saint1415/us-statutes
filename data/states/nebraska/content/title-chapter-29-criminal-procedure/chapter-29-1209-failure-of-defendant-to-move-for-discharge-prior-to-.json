State v. Dockery, 273 Neb. 330, 729 N.W.2d 320 (2007).\n\nIt is incumbent upon defendant and his counsel to file a timely motion for discharge in order to avoid the waiver provided for by this section. State v. Kearns, 245 Neb. 728, 514 N.W.2d 844 (1994).\n\nAs long as a defendant was properly advised of his rights, by either counsel or the court, by knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleading guilty, the defendant waives his statutory right to a speedy trial. State v. McNitt, 216 Neb. 837, 346 N.W.2d 259 (1984).\n\nIt was not the duty of the trial court to suggest to the defendant or his counsel that he file a motion for discharge. State v. Hert, 192 Neb. 751, 224 N.W.2d 188 (1974).\n\nA writ of habeas corpus would not issue to permit collateral attack on a sentence for first degree sexual assault and first degree false imprisonment based on an alleged speedy trial violation that the prisoner waived by failing to file a motion for discharge. Jones v. Nebraska Dept. of Corr. Servs., 21 Neb. App. 206, 838 N.W.2d 51 (2013).",
