It shall also include the pursuit of a person suspected of having committed a supposed felony, though no felony has actually been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed. Fresh pursuit shall not necessarily imply instant pursuit, but pursuit without unreasonable delay.\n\nSourceLaws 1937, c. 70, § 5, p. 256;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 29-420;R.S.1943, § 29-420;Laws 2001, LB 299, § 3.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIn order for search to be valid in connection with fresh pursuit, felony must have been committed in another state.
