Except for attendance at court and transportation to or from any place where the prisoner's presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution. However, the prisoner shall not be classified as a pretrial detainee but shall be deemed to remain in custody of the Department of Correctional Services and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the Department of Correctional Services' facility to which he or she was confined.\n\nSourceLaws 1984, LB 591, § 6.",
