The jurors whose names are so drawn shall be summoned to forthwith appear before the court, and, after having been examined, such as are found qualified and have no lawful excuse for not serving as jurors shall constitute a special venire from which the court shall proceed to have a jury impaneled for the trial of the cause. The court may repeat the exercise of this power until all the parties charged in the same indictment or information have been tried.\n\nSourceLaws 1881, c. 34, § 1, p. 213;R.S.1913, § 9106;C.S.1922, § 10131;C.S.1929, § 29-2003;R.S.1943, § 29-2003;Laws 2020, LB387, § 42.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIf several juries are picked at one time from a single jury panel for a series of trials, examination must be allowed if requested for good reason in subsequent trials in the series to determine if any jurors should be excused for cause.
