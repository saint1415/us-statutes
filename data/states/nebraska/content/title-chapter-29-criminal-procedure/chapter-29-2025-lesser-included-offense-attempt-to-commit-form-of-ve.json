State v. Ambrose, 192 Neb. 285, 220 N.W.2d 18 (1974).\n\nThe unlawful operation of a motor vehicle is not necessarily an included offense in prosecution for motor vehicle homicide. Olney v. State, 169 Neb. 717, 100 N.W.2d 838 (1960).\n\nCharge of shooting with intent to wound may include lesser offense of assault or assault and battery. Moore v. State, 147 Neb. 390, 23 N.W.2d 552 (1946).\n\nIt is not error to fail to submit question of accused's guilt of lesser offense where evidence is not such as to warrant such verdict. Davis v. State, 116 Neb. 90, 215 N.W. 785 (1927).\n\nJury may find accused not guilty of offense charged but guilty of attempt to commit same where such attempt is an offense.

State, 58 Neb. 204, 78 N.W. 525 (1890).\n\nVerdict of guilty of manslaughter on charge of murder in first degree is valid, though it fails to specifically negative fact that crime was of higher grade. Williams v. State, 6 Neb. 334 (1877).",
