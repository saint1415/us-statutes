The court may assess a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for each day such person fails to comply. No person shall be found to be in contempt of court nor shall any fine be assessed if compliance with such subpoena violates such person's right against self-incrimination.\n\nSourceLaws 2004, LB 1084, § 14;R.S.Supp.,2004, § 68-1086;Laws 2006, LB 1248, § 47.",
