Families receiving occasional respite services are less likely to request admission of an individual to a nursing home, foster care, or other out-of-home care at public expense;\n\n(2) Respite services reduce family and caregiver stress, enhance family and caregiver coping ability, and strengthen family and caregiver ability to meet the challenging demands of caring for family members;\n\n(3) Respite services reduce the risk of abuse and neglect of children, senior citizens, and other vulnerable groups; and\n\n(4) Coordinated, noncategorical respite services must be available locally to provide reliable respite services when needed by families and caregivers regardless of where they live in Nebraska.\n\nSourceLaws 1999, LB 148, § 1.",
