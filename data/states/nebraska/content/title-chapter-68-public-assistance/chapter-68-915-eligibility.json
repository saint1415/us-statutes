By adopting the provisions of federal law, this section provides that caretaker relatives are eligible for medical assistance benefits. The Legislature may lawfully adopt by reference an existing law or regulation of another jurisdiction, including the United States. Clemens v. Harvey, 247 Neb. 77, 525 N.W.2d 185 (1994).\n\nIn order for a minor or an incompetent adult without a legal guardian to qualify for assistance under this section, the applicant's parent must be a legal resident of Nebraska, the applicant's legal residence in Nebraska must be established by a court, or the applicant must have left her parents' home while the parents were legal residents of Nebraska.
