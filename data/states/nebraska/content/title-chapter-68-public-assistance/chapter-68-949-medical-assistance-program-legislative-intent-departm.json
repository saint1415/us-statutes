Such recommendations shall be consistent with the public policy in section 68-905 and shall consider the needs and resources of low-income Nebraska residents who are eligible or may become eligible for medical assistance, the experience and outcomes of other states that have developed and implemented such changes, and other relevant factors as determined by the department.\n\n(4)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that the total amount appropriated to the department for medicaid nursing facility rates be used in the medicaid nursing facility rate calculation, including the calculation of the annual inflation factor. The total amount appropriated for medicaid nursing facility rates shall include amounts for rate enhancement and any other purpose related to medicaid nursing facility services and shall be used as the base for funding for the following fiscal year.\n\n(b) The department shall file a report electronically with the Legislative Fiscal Analyst and the Clerk of the Legislature no later than August 1 of each year identifying how the inflation factor was calculated for that year's medicaid nursing facility rates.\n\n(c) The department shall file a report electronically with the Legislative Fiscal Analyst and the Clerk of the Legislature between December 15 and December 31 of each year identifying the amount of any remaining unobligated appropriation from the prior appropriations earmarked for medicaid nursing facility payments. The report shall include an identification of encumbrances and retroactive payments.\n\nSourceLaws 2006, LB 1248, § 49;Laws 2007, LB296, § 263;Laws 2008, LB928, § 16;Laws 2017, LB417, § 9;Laws 2017, LB644, § 17;Laws 2024, LB130, § 1.",
