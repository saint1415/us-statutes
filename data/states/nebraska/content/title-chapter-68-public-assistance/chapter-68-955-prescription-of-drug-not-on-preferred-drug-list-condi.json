The department shall respond to a prior authorization request no later than twenty-four hours after receiving such request.\n\n(2) A health care provider may prescribe a prescription drug not on the preferred drug list to a medicaid recipient without prior authorization by the department or a managed care organization if the provider certifies that (a) the recipient is achieving therapeutic success with a course of antidepressant, antipsychotic, or anticonvulsant medication or medication for human immunodeficiency virus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cancer, or immunosuppressant therapy or (b) the recipient has experienced a prior therapeutic failure with a medication.\n\n(3) Neither the department nor a managed care organization shall require prior authorization for coverage for an antidepressant, antipsychotic, or anticonvulsant prescription drug that is deemed medically necessary by a patient's health care provider for a new or existing medicaid recipient if the medicaid recipient has prior prescription history for the antidepressant, antipsychotic, or anticonvulsant prescription drug within the immediately preceding ninety-day period. A prospective drug utilization review as described in section 38-2869 and applicable federal law for a prescription for an antidepressant, antipsychotic, or anticonvulsant prescription drug for a medicaid recipient with prior prescription history within the immediately preceding ninety-day period shall occur in order to ensure that the prescription for a medicaid recipient is appropriate and is not likely to result in adverse medical results. Use of a pharmaceutical sample is not considered prior prescription history.\n\nSourceLaws 2008, LB830, § 7;Laws 2020, LB1052, § 4.",
