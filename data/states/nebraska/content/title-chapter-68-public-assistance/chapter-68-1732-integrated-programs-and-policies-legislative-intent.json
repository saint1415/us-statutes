Organizational mergers and operating agreements shall be developed within state government which bring together the state's community-based child-serving and family-serving resources in the areas of health care services, social services, mental health services, developmental disabilities services, juvenile justice, and education. Such actions shall eliminate the need for the public to understand the differing roles, responsibilities, and services of the agencies enumerated in this section and their affiliates.\n\nSourceLaws 1994, LB 1224, § 32;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 365;Laws 2007, LB296, § 291.",
