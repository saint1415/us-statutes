      "text": "68-972.Prenatal care; legislative findings; creation of separate program; benefits provided; department; submit state plan amendment or waiver; eligibility.\n\n(1) The Legislature finds that:\n\n(a) Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, authorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program to assist state efforts to initiate and expand provisions of child health assistance to uninsured, low-income children;\n\n(b) As defined in Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, child means an individual under the age of nineteen years, including any period of time from conception to birth, up to age nineteen years;\n\n(c) Pursuant to Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, eligibility can only be conferred to a targeted low-income child, including an unborn child, under a separate child health program;\n\n(d) Under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, child health assistance is available to benefit unborn children independent of the mother's eligibility and immigration status;\n\n(e) Under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, child health assistance expressly includes prenatal care that connects to the health of the unborn child;\n\n(f) Prenatal care has been clearly shown to reduce the likelihood of premature delivery or low birth weight, both of which are associated with a wide range of congenital disabilities as well as infant mortality, and such care can detect a great number of serious and even life-threatening disabilities, many of which can now be successfully treated in utero;\n\n(g) Ensuring prenatal care for more children will significantly help reduce infant mortality and morbidity rates and will spare many infants from the burden of congenital disabilities and reduce the cost of treating those congenital disabilities after birth;\n\n(h) It is well established that access to prenatal care can improve health outcomes during infancy as well as over a child's life. Since healthy babies and children require less medical care than babies and children with health problems, provision of prenatal care will result in lower medical expenditures for the affected children in the long run; and\n\n(i) Adopting federal law to provide for medical services related to unborn children before birth will result in healthier infants, better long-term child growth and development, and ultimate cost savings to the state through reduced expenditures for high cost neonatal and potential long-term medical rehabilitation.\n\n(2) Such coverage shall be implemented through the creation of a separate program as allowed under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and 42 C.F.R. 457.10, solely for the unborn children of mothers who are ineligible for coverage under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. All other aspects of the medical assistance program relating to the State Children's Health Insurance Program remain a medicaid expansion program as defined in 42 C.F.R. 457.10.\n\n(3) The benefits provided pursuant to this subsection, unless the recipient qualifies for coverage under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, shall be prenatal care and pregnancy-related services connected to the health of the unborn child, including: (a) Professional fees for labor and delivery, including live birth, fetal death, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy; (b) pharmaceuticals and prescription vitamins; (c) outpatient hospital care; (d) radiology, ultrasound, and other necessary imaging; (e) necessary laboratory testing; (f) hospital costs related to labor and delivery; (g) services related to conditions that could complicate the pregnancy, including those for diagnosis or treatment of illness or medical conditions that threaten the carrying of the unborn child to full term or the safe delivery of the unborn child; and (h) other pregnancy-related services approved by the department. Services not covered under this subsection include medical issues separate to the mother and unrelated to pregnancy.\n\n(4) The department shall receive the state and federal funds appropriated or provided for benefits provided pursuant to this section. Within thirty days after July 19, 2012, the department shall submit a state plan amendment or waiver for approval by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to provide coverage under the medical assistance program to persons eligible under this section.\n\n(5) Eligibility shall be determined under this section using an income budgetary methodology that determines children's eligibility at no greater than one hundred eighty-five percent of the Office of Management and Budget income poverty guideline.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB599, § 4.",
