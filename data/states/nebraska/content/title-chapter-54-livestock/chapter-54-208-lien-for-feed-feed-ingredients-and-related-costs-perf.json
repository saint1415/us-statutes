The lien may only be enforced against the person, firm, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation who has contracted or agreed for such feed or feed ingredients and related costs incurred in the delivery of such feed or feed ingredients.\n\nA lien created under this section shall be perfected as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code. Any financing statement filed to perfect such lien shall contain or have attached thereto:\n\n(1) The name and address and the social security number or federal tax identification number of the person, firm, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation claiming the lien;\n\n(2) The name and address and the social security number or federal tax identification number, if known, of the person, firm, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation for whom such feed or feed ingredients were delivered;\n\n(3) The amount due for such feed or feed ingredients and related delivery costs covered by the lien;\n\n(4) The place where such livestock are located;\n\n(5) A reasonable description of such livestock including the number and type of such livestock; and\n\n(6) The last date on which such feed or feed ingredients were delivered.\n\nThe failure to include the social security number or federal tax identification number shall not render any filing unperfected. At the time the lien is filed, the lienholder shall send a copy to the person, firm, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation for whom the feed or feed ingredients were delivered.\n\nSuch lien shall attach and have priority as of the date of the filing if filed in the manner provided in this section. Such lien shall be treated in all respects as an agricultural lien as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and may be enforced in the manner and form provided for the enforcement of secured transactions as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe fee for filing, amending, or releasing such lien shall be the same as set forth in section 9-525, Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nEffective January 1, 2015, this section applies to a lien created under this section regardless of when the lien was created.\n\nNothing in this section shall be construed to amend or repeal section 54-201 relating to agisters' liens.\n\nSourceLaws 1984, LB 1064, § 1;Laws 1988, LB 943, § 19;Laws 1993, LB 121, § 336;Laws 1998, LB 1321, § 97;Laws 1999, LB 550, § 37;Laws 2001, LB 54, § 26;Laws 2014, LB750, § 17.",
