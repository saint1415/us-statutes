For good cause shown, the district court may appoint the director or the director's designee to serve as a receiver for the purchaser for the protection of the sellers of slaughter livestock to the purchaser. It shall be the duty of each county attorney or the Attorney General to whom the director reports any violation to cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper courts without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner required by law.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 448, § 5, p. 1500;Laws 1984, LB 824, § 1.",
