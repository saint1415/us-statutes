Such inspection shall be made by a designated veterinarian. The fees for such inspection shall be established by rules and regulations of the department and shall be collected by the operator of the livestock auction market. Such fees shall be used to pay the fees of necessary inspections and for no other purpose and shall be remitted as may be provided by regulation. The fees shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Livestock Auction Market Fund and shall be expended exclusively to pay the fees of providing necessary inspections at the livestock auction market which has remitted such fees. Each designated veterinarian making market inspections shall be paid twenty-five dollars for each regularly scheduled sale day in each calendar month as a guaranteed minimum salary for providing adequate inspection services. If the fees collected each calendar month by the market operator do not equal such amount, the market operator shall make up the difference in his or her remittance to the state. The rules and regulations establishing fees for such inspection shall not be adopted, amended, or repealed until after notice by mail to each market licensee and designated veterinarian of the time and place of hearing on the question of adoption, amendment, or repeal of such rules and regulations; such notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the date of hearing and shall be sufficient if addressed to the last-known address of each market licensee and designated veterinarian shown on the records of the department.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 319, § 24, p. 971;Laws 1965, c. 334, § 5, p. 956;Laws 1969, c. 454, § 1, p. 1543;Laws 2001, LB 197, § 20;Laws 2014, LB884, § 30.",
