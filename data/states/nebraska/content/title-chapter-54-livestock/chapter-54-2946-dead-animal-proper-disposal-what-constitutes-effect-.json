The sheriff may enter any premises where any such carcass is located for the purpose of carrying out this section and may cause each carcass to be properly buried or disposed of on such premises. The county board of commissioners or supervisors shall allow such sums for the services as it may deem reasonable, and such sums shall be paid to the persons rendering the services upon vouchers as other claims against the county are paid. The owner of such animal shall be liable to the county for the expense of such burial or disposal, to be recovered in a civil action, unless the owner pays such expenses within thirty days after notice and demand therefor.\n\n(5) If anthrax is suspected in any animal death, the owner or custodian of the animal or herd shall be responsible to have samples submitted to an approved laboratory for confirmation.\n\n(6) If an animal has or is suspected to have died of anthrax, it shall be unlawful to:\n\n(a) Transport such animal or animal carcass, except as directed and approved by the department;\n\n(b) Use the flesh or organs of such animal or animal carcass for food for livestock or human consumption; or\n\n(c) Remove the skin or hide of such animal or animal carcass.\n\n(7) The disposition of any anthrax-infected animal carcass shall be carried out under the direction of the department.

If such carcass is buried, no portion of the carcass shall be interred closer than six feet from the surface of the ground.
