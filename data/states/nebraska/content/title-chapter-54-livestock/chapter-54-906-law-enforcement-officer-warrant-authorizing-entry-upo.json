The custody agreement shall be signed by the owner or custodian of the livestock animal. A copy of the signed agreement shall be provided to the owner or custodian of the livestock animal. A violation of the custody agreement may result in the seizure of the livestock animal.\n\n(4) Any equipment, device, or other property or things involved in a violation of section 54-903 or 54-904 shall be subject to seizure, and distribution or disposition may be made in such manner as the court may direct. Any livestock animal involved in a violation of section 54-903 or 54-904 shall be subject to seizure. Distribution or disposition shall be made under section 54-913 as the court may direct. Any livestock animal seized under this subsection may be kept by the law enforcement officer on the property of the owner or custodian of such livestock animal.\n\n(5) A law enforcement officer may euthanize or cause a livestock animal seized or kept pursuant to this section to be euthanized if the animal is severely emaciated, injured, disabled, or diseased past recovery for any useful purpose. The law enforcement officer shall notify the owner or custodian prior to the euthanasia if practicable under the circumstances. An owner or custodian may request that a veterinarian of the owner's or custodian's choosing view the livestock animal and be present upon examination of the livestock animal, and no livestock animal shall be euthanized without reasonable accommodation to provide for the presence of the owner's or custodian's veterinarian when requested. However, attempted notification of the owner or custodian or the presence of the owner's or custodian's veterinarian shall not unduly delay euthanasia when necessary. The law enforcement officer may forgo euthanasia if the care of the livestock animal is placed with the owner's or custodian's veterinarian.\n\n(6) A law enforcement officer acting under this section shall not be liable for damage to property if such damage is not the result of the officer's negligence.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB865, § 6;Laws 2013, LB423, § 8.",
