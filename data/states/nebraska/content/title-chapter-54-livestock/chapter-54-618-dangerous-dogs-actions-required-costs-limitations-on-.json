The cost of both procedures is the responsibility of the owner of the dangerous dog. Written proof of both procedures and the microchip identification number shall be provided to the animal control authority after the procedures are completed.\n\n(2) No owner of a dangerous dog shall permit the dog to go beyond the property of the owner unless the dog is restrained securely by a chain or leash.\n\n(3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section or for a reasonable veterinary purpose, no owner of a dangerous dog shall transport such dog or permit such dog to be transported to another county, city, or village in this state.\n\n(4) An owner of a dangerous dog may transport such dog or permit such dog to be transported to another county, city, or village in this state for the purpose of permanent relocation of the owner if the owner has obtained written permission prior to such relocation from the animal control authority of the county, city, or village in which the owner resides and from the county, city, or village in which the owner will reside. Each animal control authority may grant such permission based upon a reasonable evaluation of both the owner and the dog, including if the owner has complied with the laws of this state and of the county, city, or village in which he or she resides with regard to dangerous dogs after the dog was declared dangerous. An animal control authority shall not grant permission under this subsection if the county, city, or village has an ordinance or resolution prohibiting the relocation of dangerous dogs. After the permanent relocation, the animal control authority of the county, city, or village in which the owner resides shall monitor the owner and such dog for a period of at least thirty days but not to exceed ninety days to ensure the owner's compliance with the laws of this state and of such county, city, or village with regard to dangerous dogs. Nothing in this subsection shall permit the rescindment of the declaration of dangerous dog.\n\nSourceLaws 1989, LB 208, § 2;Laws 2008, LB1055, § 17.",
