For such use of armories or facilities he may exact such rent as may be necessary to meet the expense of such meeting, clean and maintain the premises, or pay for extra help required.\n\nSourceLaws 1929, c. 189, § 22, p. 662;C.S.1929, § 55-128;R.S.1943, § 55-151;Laws 1961, c. 274, § 1, p. 808;R.R.S.1943, § 55-151;Laws 1969, c. 459, § 30, p. 1591.",
