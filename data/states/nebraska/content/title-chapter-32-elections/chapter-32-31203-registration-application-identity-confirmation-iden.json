The acknowledgment shall advise the registrant to contact the election commissioner or county clerk if the registrant has reason to believe that the number added to his or her voter registration record is incorrect or invalid.\n\n(4) If the applicant for registration does not have a Nebraska driver's license or a social security number or if the applicant's Nebraska driver's license or social security number cannot be confirmed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the unique identifying number generated and assigned to the applicant's voter registration record in the voter registration register shall be used to identify the registrant for voter registration purposes.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 566, § 14.",
