Any candidate who swears falsely as to political party affiliation or swears that he or she affiliates with two or more political parties shall not be the candidate of such party and shall not be entitled to assume the office for which he or she filed even if he or she receives a majority or plurality of the votes therefor at the following general election.\n\n(3) The name of a candidate shall not appear printed on more than one political party ballot. A candidate who is the nominee of one political party shall not accept the nomination of another political party.\n\n(4) In order to count write-in votes on a political party ballot in the primary election, the candidate who receives the votes must be a registered voter of that political party unless the political party allows candidates not affiliated with the party by not adopting a rule under section 32-702.\n\nSourceLaws 1994, LB 76, § 180;Laws 1997, LB 764, § 58;Laws 2007, LB646, § 4;Laws 2015, LB575, § 16.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA person who has no \"political party affiliation\" cannot change his or her \"political party affiliation.\" Davis v.
