The abstract shall be signed by the members of the board and shall have the seal of the state affixed by the Secretary of State.

Receipt by the presidential electors of a party or a group of petitioners of the highest number of votes statewide shall constitute election of the two at-large presidential electors of that party or group of petitioners. Receipt by the presidential electors of a party or a group of petitioners of the highest number of votes in a congressional district shall constitute election of the congressional district presidential elector of that party or group of petitioners.\n\n(2) The board of state canvassers shall determine from the completed abstract the names of those candidates who have been nominated or elected. If any two or more persons are returned with an equal and the highest number of votes, the board of state canvassers shall decide by lot which of such persons is elected except for officers elected to the executive branch.
