Frazier, 28 Neb. 438, 44 N.W. 471 (1890).\n\nThe statute provides an adequate remedy, either by contest or quo warranto, for the settlement of the rights of parties in disputed elections, and equity has no jurisdiction to enjoin an officer holding an election certificate from taking office. State ex rel. Hunt v. Mayor and City Council of Kearney, 28 Neb. 103, 44 N.W. 90 (1889).\n\nThe grounds of contest enumerated in this section are sufficient grounds of removal in an action of quo warranto. State ex rel.

Hocknell v. Roper, 46 Neb. 730, 65 N.W. 802 (1896).\n\nThe proceeding provided for by this article is not an exclusive remedy by which elections for relocating county seats must be contested, and a taxpayer may enjoin the calling of an unauthorized election. Solomon v. Fleming, 34 Neb. 40, 51 N.W. 304 (1892).\n\nThe question of the jurisdiction of the county commissioners to call an election for the purpose of locating the county seat may properly be presented in a proceeding to contest the election.
