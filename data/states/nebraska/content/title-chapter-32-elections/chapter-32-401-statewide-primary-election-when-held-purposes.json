Marsh, 120 Neb. 287, 232 N.W. 99 (1930), 72 A.L.R. 285 (1930).\n\nThe purpose of the primary election law was to provide an easy method by which a person might become a candidate for state office, either on his own initiative, or by petition of a designated number of electors.

Wait, 92 Neb. 313, 138 N.W. 159 (1912), 43 L.R.A.N.S. 282 (1912).\n\nUnder former statute, a person was permitted to be a candidate of more than one political party in the primary election.
