The appointment cannot be made until after service of the summons in the action as directed by this code.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 38, p. 399;R.S.1913, § 7590;C.S.1922, § 8533;C.S.1929, § 20-309;R.S.1943, § 25-309;Laws 1975, LB 481, § 12;Laws 2022, LB741, § 2.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Probate Code, see section 30-2201.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1. Appointment of guardian\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Appointment of guardian\n\nAn infant must be defended in a lawsuit by a guardian. Carlos H. v. Lindsay M., 283 Neb. 1004, 815 N.W.2d 168 (2012).\n\nThe defense of an infant must be made by a guardian for the suit. Omey v. Stauffer, 174 Neb. 247, 117 N.W.2d 481 (1962).\n\nThe defense of a minor must be made by a guardian ad litem. Peterson v. Skiles, 173 Neb. 470, 113 N.W.2d 628 (1962).\n\nAppointment of guardian ad litem should not be made until after service of process in the action. Marsh v. Marsh, 173 Neb. 282, 113 N.W.2d 323 (1962).\n\nAppointment of guardian ad litem was proper. Cass v. Pense, 155 Neb. 792, 54 N.W.2d 68 (1952).\n\nFailure of court to appoint guardian ad litem for minor, under circumstances disclosed, was not prejudicial error. Kuhlman v. Schacht, 130 Neb. 511, 265 N.W. 549 (1936).\n\nWhere partition suit is brought by father against minor children under fourteen, service on minors and plaintiff as father and guardian is sufficient to confer jurisdiction to appoint guardian ad litem. Beadle v. Beadle, 102 Neb. 73, 165 N.W. 953 (1917).\n\nWhere minor acquires title to subject matter of action while it is pending, failure to appoint guardian ad litem will not invalidate judgment. Shelby v. St. James Orphan Asylum, 66 Neb. 40, 92 N.W. 155 (1902).\n\nFailure to appoint guardian ad litem was merely error; it does not render void the judgment entered. Manfull v. Graham, 55 Neb. 645, 76 N.W. 19 (1898).\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\nThis section refers to the defense of infants, rather than to affirmative action on their behalf. In re Bayer's Estate, 116 Neb. 670, 218 N.W. 746 (1928).\n\nGuardian should resist payment of illegal attorney fees out of estate of ward. Ress v. Shepherd, 84 Neb. 268, 120 N.W. 1132 (1909).",
