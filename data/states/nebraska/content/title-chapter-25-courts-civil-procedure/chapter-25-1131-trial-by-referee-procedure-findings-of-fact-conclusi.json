      "text": "25-1131.Trial by referee; procedure; findings of fact; conclusions of law; effect.\n\nThe trial before referees is conducted in the same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, to administer all necessary oaths in the trial of the case, and to grant adjournments, as the court upon such trial. They must state the facts found and the conclusions of law, separately, and their decision must be given, and may be excepted to and reviewed in like manner. The report of the referees upon the whole issue stands as the decision of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court. When the reference is to report the facts, the report has the effect of a special verdict.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 300, p. 445;R.S.1913, § 7869;C.S.1922, § 8814;C.S.1929, § 20-1131;R.S.1943, § 25-1131.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
