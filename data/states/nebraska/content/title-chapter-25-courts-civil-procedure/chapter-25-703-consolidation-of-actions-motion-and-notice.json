      "text": "25-703.Consolidation of actions; motion and notice.\n\nWhenever two or more actions are pending in the same court which might have been joined, the defendant may, on motion and notice to the adverse party, require him to show cause why the same shall not be consolidated, and if no such cause be shown, the said several actions shall be consolidated.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 150, p. 416;R.S.1913, § 7659;C.S.1922, § 8603;C.S.1929, § 20-703;R.S.1943, § 25-703.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIf the plaintiff does not choose to unite several causes of action in one petition and the defendant does not successfully require joinder, there is no legal requirement that distinct causes of action be joined in one suit. Suhr v. City of Scribner, 207 Neb. 24, 295 N.W.2d 302 (1980).\n\nRight of consolidation under this section is dependent upon an application by a defendant. Bruno v.
