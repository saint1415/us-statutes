      "text": "25-531.Lis pendens; notice; where filed; contents; recording; cancellation; filing fee.\n\nWhen the summons has been served or publication made, the action is pending so as to charge third persons with notice of pendency. While the action is pending no interest can be acquired by third persons in the subject matter thereof, as against the plaintiff's title. In all actions brought to affect the title to real property, the plaintiff may either at the time of filing his or her complaint or afterwards, file, or in case any defendant sets up an affirmative cause of action and demands relief which shall affect the title to real estate, he or she may, at the time of filing such answer or at any time afterwards, file with the clerk or register of deeds of each county in which the real estate thus to be affected, or any part thereof, is situated, a notice of the pendency of such action. The notice shall contain the names of the parties, the object of the action, and a description of the property in such county sought to be affected thereby. If the action is for foreclosure of a mortgage, such notice shall contain the date of the mortgage, the parties thereto, and the time and place of recording the same. The clerk or register of deeds of such county shall record the notice thus filed and enter the same upon the numerical index of all lands, any part of which is included in the description in the notice, for which he or she shall be entitled to receive filing fees in accordance with section 33-109, to be paid by the person filing such notice, and which shall be taxed as part of the costs in the action. From the time of filing such notice the pendency of such action shall be constructive notice to any purchaser or encumbrancer to be affected thereby. Every person whose conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently recorded shall be deemed to be a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer and shall be bound by all proceedings taken in the action after the filing of such notice to the same extent as if he or she were made a party to the action. The court in which such action was commenced or any judge thereof may at any time thereafter on the application of any person aggrieved, on good cause shown, and on such notice as the court or judge may determine, order the notice to be canceled by the clerk or register of deeds of any county in which the notice may have been filed or recorded by filing a notice of release. In actions in which such notice is filed in a county or counties, other than the county in which the action is pending, the county clerk or the register of deeds of the county in which the action was begun may cancel such notice by executing a written release under his or her hand and seal by reason of the order of the court or judge, and forward such release by mail to the county clerk or register of deeds of the county in which the notice has been filed or recorded, and which certificate such county clerk or register of deeds shall record in the records of his or her office. At any time after such notice of pendency is recorded, the party on whose behalf the same was filed or the party's attorney of record may cause the notice to be canceled in the office of the county clerk or register of deeds of any county in which the notice has been filed or recorded. Such cancellation may be made by written release in the same manner as such cancellations are entered on order of the court. For the service required by this section, the county clerk or register of deeds shall be entitled to charge and receive fees in accordance with section 33-109, to be paid by the party causing the service to be performed.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 85, p. 407;Laws 1887, c. 92, § 1, p. 643;R.S.1913, § 7651;C.S.1922, § 8595;C.S.1929, § 20-531;R.S.1943, § 25-531;Laws 1959, c. 140, § 1, p. 544;Laws 1963, c. 140, § 1, p. 517;Laws 1969, c. 181, § 1, p. 772;Laws 1971, LB 90, § 1;Laws 2002, LB 876, § 18;Laws 2012, LB14, § 2.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1. Scope\n\n2. Subsequent purchasers\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\n1.

Nicholas, 6 F.2d 10 (8th Cir. 1925).\n\n2.

Brown v. Jacobsen Land & Cattle Co., 297 Neb. 541, 900 N.W.2d 765 (2017).\n\nThe court having jurisdiction, a party cannot, while the action is pending, dispose of the property and avoid the effect of the final judgment in the case.
