Humfeldt v. Moles, 63 Neb. 448, 88 N.W. 655 (1902).\n\nStriking cause from docket is a suspension but not a dismissal of action. Hayden v. Huff, 62 Neb. 375, 87 N.W. 184 (1901).\n\nWhere the record did not show that the plaintiff died more than 1 year prior to the trial court's order dismissing the cause for lack of prosecution, that order could not be construed as an order striking the action from the docket. Linch v. Northport Irr. Dist., 14 Neb. App. 842, 717 N.W.2d 522 (2006).\n\nWhere cause of action cannot be revived, it must be stricken from the docket. Fitzgerald v. Clarke, 9 Neb.
