Right to partition\n\n2. Procedure\n\n3. Attorney's fees\n\n1. Right to partition\n\nThe removal of minerals whether held in solution upon the land or resting in the soil or subsurface, is the removal of a component part of the real estate itself. The severance changes the character of the property, but it remains real estate until detached. Wheelock & Manning OO Ranches, Inc. v. Heath, 201 Neb. 835, 272 N.W.2d 768 (1978).\n\nOnce joint title in real estate is established, partition may be had as a matter of law. Yunghans v. O'Toole, 199 Neb. 317, 258 N.W.2d 810 (1977).\n\nA life tenant who owns no other interest in the property cannot compel partition over objection of remaindermen. Dixon v. Dixon, 189 Neb. 212, 202 N.W.2d 180 (1972).\n\nLessee for a term of years cannot prevent partition where life tenant fails to object to partition. Hartman v. Drake, 166 Neb. 87, 87 N.W.2d 895 (1958).\n\nJoint tenants and tenants in common of a future interest, subject to an outstanding life estate in the whole of the premises, may bring or be compelled to suffer partition. Baskins v. Krepcik, 153 Neb. 36, 43 N.W.2d 624 (1950).\n\nWhen there is outstanding estate for life vested in another to the whole of the premises for which partition is sought, a remainderman cannot maintain partition over the objection of the holder of the life estate. Bodeman v. Cary, 152 Neb. 506, 41 N.W.2d 797 (1950).\n\nThis state enacted partition statute to give parties the right to sale of property and division of proceeds where partition in kind could not be made without great prejudice to the owners. Trowbridge v. Donner, 152 Neb. 206, 40 N.W.2d 655 (1950).\n\nEach joint tenant is entitled to partition of estate continuing during life of all tenants; on death of one of two joint tenants, survivor takes all. Arthur v. Arthur, 115 Neb. 781, 215 N.W. 117 (1927).\n\nLife tenant and remaindermen cannot require other remaindermen to submit to partition against their will, contrary to will restricting right. Freeland v. Andersen, 114 Neb. 822, 211 N.W. 167 (1926).\n\nRemaindermen cannot maintain partition over objection of life tenant. Weddingfeld v. Weddingfeld, 109 Neb. 729, 192 N.W. 227 (1923).\n\nPartition is not maintainable in violation of plaintiff's agreement or of restriction imposed by grantor. Wicker v. Moore, 79 Neb. 755, 113 N.W. 148 (1907).\n\nOnly joint tenant or tenant in common may maintain action; administrator cannot. Phillips v. Dorris, 56 Neb. 293, 76 N.W. 555 (1898); Barr v. Lamaster, 48 Neb. 114, 66 N.W. 1110 (1896).\n\nCompulsory partition is matter of right of any tenant; co-reversioners may partition. Oliver v. Lansing, 50 Neb. 828, 70 N.W. 369 (1897).\n\n2. Procedure\n\nPetition in action for partition was not defective because of failure to allege joint tenancy where facts were alleged in detail setting out the interests of the parties. Giles v. Sheridan, 179 Neb. 257, 137 N.W.2d 828 (1965).\n\nOne of several tenants in common has an absolute right to a partition of real estate, in the absence of an agreement or other impediment to the contrary, and such action may be brought by the guardian of an incompetent person who is a tenant in common. Windle v. Kelly, 135 Neb. 143, 280 N.W. 445 (1938).\n\nWhere there is an estate for life vested in a third person in the whole of the premises of which partition is sought a remainderman cannot maintain an action in partition over the objection of the holder of the life estate. Bartels v. Seefus, 132 Neb. 841, 273 N.W. 485 (1937).\n\nIt is error to order partition, over objection of some beneficiaries, of land conveyed in trust to pay rents and profits to beneficiaries and to sell land within trustee's discretion; if trustee dies, successor should be appointed. Heiser v. Brehm, 117 Neb. 472, 221 N.W. 97 (1928).\n\n3. Attorney's fees\n\nWhere partition proceedings are amicable and for the benefit of all parties in interest, an attorney's fee should be allowed even though there is a contest between the parties over whether property sold for fair value at partition sale. Wilcox v. Halligan, 141 Neb. 643, 4 N.W.2d 750 (1942).",
