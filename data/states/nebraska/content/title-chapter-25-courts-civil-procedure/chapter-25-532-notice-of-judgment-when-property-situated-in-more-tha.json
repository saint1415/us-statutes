It shall operate as such notice without record in the county where it is rendered; but this section shall not apply to actions or proceedings under any statute now in force which does not require such record.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 86, p. 407;R.S.1913, § 7652;C.S.1922, § 8596;C.S.1929, § 20-532;R.S.1943, § 25-532.",
