Boone County Old Age Assistance Board v. Myhre, 149 Neb. 669, 32 N.W.2d 262 (1948).\n\nThis section was applicable to federal civil rights claim of former guidance counselor in action against school district on allegations dismissal was due to his race and his exercise of First Amendment rights. Chambers v. Omaha Public School Dist., 536 F.2d 222 (8th Cir. 1976).\n\nSummons issued before time allowed by statute of limitations has expired will give court jurisdiction even though served after time has expired. Sandobal v. Armour & Co., 429 F.2d 249 (8th Cir. 1970).\n\nUnder former law, section 43-666, R.R.S.1943, is not sufficiently analogous to 20 U.S.C. section 1415 for its statute of limitation to apply to actions under that federal statute. However, the statute of limitations under either section 25-212 or 25-219, R.R.S.1943, appears to be more appropriate. Monahan v. State of Neb., 491 F.Supp. 1074 (D. Neb. 1980).\n\nThe statute of limitation for commencement of suits under the federal civil rights act, which guarantees equal rights under the law, is the three-year statute of limitation set by this section. Metcalf v. Omaha Steel Casting Co., 476 F.Supp. 870 (D. Neb. 1979).",
