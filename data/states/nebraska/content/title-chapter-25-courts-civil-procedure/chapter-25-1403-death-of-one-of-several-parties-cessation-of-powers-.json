Muller v. Weeder, 313 Neb. 639, 986 N.W.2d 38 (2023).\n\nAn order reviving an action, whether the order was entered in proceedings under section 25-322 or under this section to section 25-1420, is not a final order from which an appeal may immediately be taken. The order may be reviewed after final judgment in the case. Platte Valley Nat. Bank v. Lasen, 273 Neb. 602, 732 N.W.2d 347 (2007).\n\nIn an action seeking damages for injuries sustained in an automobile collision, the plaintiff's cause of action survives and does not abate on his death.
