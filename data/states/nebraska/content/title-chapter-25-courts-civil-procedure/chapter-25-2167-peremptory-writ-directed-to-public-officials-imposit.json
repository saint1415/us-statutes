Such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the county where the duty ought to have been performed; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action for any penalty incurred by such officer, or member of such body or board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 656, p. 509;R.S.1913, § 8282;C.S.1922, § 9235;C.S.1929, § 20-2167;R.S.1943, § 25-2167.",
