A judgment shall be considered as rendered when such judgment has been entered on the judgment index.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 477, p. 473;R.S.1913, § 8045;C.S.1922, § 8986;Laws 1927, c. 59, § 1, p. 221;Laws 1929, c. 83, § 3, p. 333;C.S.1929, § 20-1504;R.S.1943, § 25-1504;Laws 2018, LB193, § 24.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1. Priority\n\n2. When attaches\n\n3. Other lands\n\n1. Priority\n\nLien of a prior judgment attaches the instant the judgment debtor acquires property. Glissmann v.

Startzer, 62 Neb. 718, 87 N.W. 535 (1901).\n\nLien on subsequently purchased land attaches as soon as title vests in debtor. Lessert v. Sieberling, 59 Neb. 309, 80 N.W. 900 (1899).\n\nLien is inferior to inchoate right of dower. Butler v. Fitzgerald, 43 Neb. 192, 61 N.W. 640 (1895).\n\nJudgment lien is inferior to prior unrecorded deed. Pearson v.

Moninger, 204 Neb. 679, 284 N.W.2d 855 (1979).\n\nA manual interference with chattels is not essential to a valid levy thereon. It is sufficient if the property is present and subject for the time being to the control of the officer holding the writ, if the officer in express terms asserts his dominion over the property by virtue of such writ. Credit Bureau of Broken Bow, Inc. v. Moninger, 204 Neb. 679, 284 N.W.2d 855 (1979).\n\nA judgment of the district court becomes a lien against real estate in that county from the time of its entry on the judgment record, and the judgment first entered is superior. Pontiac Improvement Co. v. Leisy, 144 Neb. 705, 14 N.W.2d 384 (1944).\n\nA judgment becomes dormant and ceases to be a lien on real estate in five years from date thereof unless execution is sued out within such period, and a judgment revived is a lien on the real estate of judgment debtor from date of the order of revivor. Glissmann v. Happy Hollow Club, 132 Neb. 223, 271 N.W. 431 (1937).\n\nTo constitute sufficient levy, officer should have property under his control and openly and expressly assert dominion over it by virtue of writ, and where debtor promised to surrender automobile for purpose of levy, seizure of it at later date was not a sufficient levy as of time of promise.

Svoboda, 118 Neb. 76, 223 N.W. 641 (1929).\n\nJudgment transcribed from justice court is lien on after acquired property. Jones v. Knosp, 91 Neb. 224, 135 N.W. 1049 (1912).\n\nJudgment is not a lien on equitable interest in land. Flint v. Chaloupka, 72 Neb. 34, 99 N.W. 825 (1904).\n\nVendee in possession is bound from time of actual notice. Wehn v.
