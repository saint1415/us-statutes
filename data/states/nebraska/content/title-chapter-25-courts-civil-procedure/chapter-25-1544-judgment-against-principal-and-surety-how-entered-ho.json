      "text": "25-1544.Judgment against principal and surety; how entered; how executed.\n\nIn all cases where judgment is rendered in any court of record within this state upon any instrument in writing in which two or more persons are jointly and severally bound, and it shall be made to appear to the court by parol or other testimony that one or more of said persons so bound signed the same as surety or bail for his or their codefendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said court in recording the judgment thereon, to certify which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which are sureties or bail. The clerk of the court aforesaid shall issue execution on such judgment, commanding the sheriff or other officer to cause the money to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor, but for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor to make the same, that he cause the same to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the surety or bail. In all cases the property, both personal and real, of the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail shall be taken in execution.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 511, p. 481;R.S.1913, § 8090;C.S.1922, § 9026;C.S.1929, § 20-1544;R.S.1943, § 25-1544.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
