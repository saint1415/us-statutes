Failure to provide the name and address required under this subsection shall not void, invalidate, or affect in any way a complaint for the foreclosure or satisfaction of a mortgage filed under this section. This subsection does not impose upon the complainant a duty to maintain the mortgaged property. The designation of a representative to receive notices shall terminate upon transfer of fee title ownership to the mortgaged property.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 850, p. 543;R.S.1913, § 8259;C.S.1922, § 9212;C.S.1929, § 20-2144;R.S.1943, § 25-2142;Laws 2002, LB 876, § 36;Laws 2015, LB151, § 1.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
