Spradlin v. Myers, 200 Neb. 559, 264 N.W.2d 658 (1978).\n\nIn case of the death of a party after final judgment and before an appeal is taken, revivor statutes do not suspend the running of time in which an appeal can be taken. Independent Lubricating Co. v. Good, 135 Neb. 171, 280 N.W. 460 (1938).\n\nWhere the sole defendant dies after filing notice of appeal and supersedeas bond, his attorney does not confer jurisdiction on Supreme Court by filing transcript after defendant's death, and court cannot substitute administrator of his estate. Independent Lubricating Co. v. Good, 133 Neb. 431, 275 N.W. 668 (1937).",
