As used in this subdivision, a designated delivery service means a delivery service designated as such pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7502(f) and a signed delivery receipt includes an electronic or facsimile receipt with an image of the recipient's signature.\n\n(2) Failure to make service by the method elected by the plaintiff does not affect the validity of the service.\n\n(3) The State Court Administrator shall maintain on the website of the Supreme Court a list of designated delivery services.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 447, § 22;Laws 1984, LB 845, § 21;Laws 2009, LB35, § 6;Laws 2011, LB669, § 7.\n\nCross ReferencesWorkers' compensation cases, manner and time of service, see sections 48-174, 48-175, 48-175.01, and 48-190.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThis section does not require service to be sent to the defendant's residence or restrict delivery to the addressee. But service must still comply with the due process requirement that notice be reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and to afford them the opportunity to present their objections. Doe v. Board of Regents, 280 Neb. 492, 788 N.W.2d 264 (2010).\n\nPlaintiff may elect to have service made by any of the methods specified in the statute. West Town Homeowners Assn. v. Schneider, 221 Neb. 674, 380 N.W.2d 265 (1986).\n\nAlthough this section does not require service to be sent to the defendant's residence or restrict delivery to the addressee, due process requires notice to be reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and to afford them the opportunity to present their objections. Capital One Bank v. Lehmann, 23 Neb. App. 292, 869 N.W.2d 917 (2015).\n\nPersonal service at work rather than at home, despite the designation on the praecipe of where service should be effected, is nonetheless valid service. Hatcher v. McShane, 12 Neb. App. 239, 670 N.W.2d 638 (2003).",
