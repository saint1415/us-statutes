If the defendant shall fail to deliver the goods and chattels at the time and place mentioned in the notice to him given, or to pay to the officer holding the execution, the full value of said goods and chattels, or the amount of said debts and costs, the undertaking, given as aforesaid, shall be considered as broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 489, p. 476;R.S.1913, § 8065;C.S.1922, § 9006;C.S.1929, § 20-1524;R.S.1943, § 25-1524.",
