If such application is resisted, the matter may be referred to a master to take and report to the court the testimony of the parties. Upon the filing of the report, the court shall, by its order, award the possession of the property and the proceeds thereof to the party entitled thereto, and thereupon the receiver shall surrender the property and the proceeds thereof to such party. All orders appointing receivers, giving them further directions, and disposing of the property may be appealed to the Court of Appeals in the same manner as final orders and decrees.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 275, p. 439;R.S.1913, § 7819;C.S.1922, § 8763;C.S.1929, § 20-1090;R.S.1943, § 25-1090;Laws 1991, LB 732, § 46.\n\nCross ReferencesFor appeals to Court of Appeals, see section 25-1911 et seq.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
