      "text": "25-1333.Case not fully adjudicated on motion.\n\nIf on motion under sections 25-1330 to 25-1336 judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.\n\nSourceLaws 1951, c. 65, § 4, p. 199.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe right of a party to sue as representative of a class may be raised by a motion for summary judgment.
