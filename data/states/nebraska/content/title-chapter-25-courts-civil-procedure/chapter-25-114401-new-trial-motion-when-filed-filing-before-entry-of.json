Lindsay Internat. Sales & Serv. v. Wegener, 297 Neb. 788, 901 N.W.2d 278 (2017).\n\nThe trial court's unsigned journal entry that was sent to both parties was the court's announcement of its decision, and thus, the defendant's motion for new trial, which was filed after the court sent the unsigned journal entry to the parties but before the court entered the marital dissolution decree, was effective under this section. Despain v. Despain, 290 Neb. 32, 858 N.W.2d 566 (2015).\n\nA motion for new trial must be filed within 10 days after an entry of judgment, which occurs when the clerk of the court places the file stamp and date upon the judgment, decree, or final order.
