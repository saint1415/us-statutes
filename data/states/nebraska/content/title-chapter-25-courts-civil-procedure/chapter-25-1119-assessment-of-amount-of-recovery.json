Bushey v. French, 171 Neb. 809, 108 N.W.2d 237 (1961).\n\nWhere jury finds for plaintiff on its cause of action, and also for defendant on its counterclaim or setoff, verdict must show amount of each finding. Horse Shoe Lake Drainage Dist. v. Crane Co., 112 Neb. 323, 199 N.W. 526 (1924).\n\nCourt cannot disregard verdict and enter such judgment as evidence warrants; if verdict is not sustained by evidence, remedy is by motion for new trial. Kenesaw Mill & E. Co. v. Aufdenkamp, 106 Neb. 246, 183 N.W. 294 (1921).\n\nCourt may in action of debt add interest when such appears from verdict to be so intended by jury. Wiruth v.
