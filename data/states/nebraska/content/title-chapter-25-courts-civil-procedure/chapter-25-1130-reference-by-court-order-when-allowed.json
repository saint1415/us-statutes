The court shall direct a reference to a referee only when caseload and time constraints require such reference, and a referee shall not be appointed to conduct any hearing involving an issue of law and not equity that could result in the exercise of the right to a trial before a jury.\n\nSourceR.S.1867, Code § 299, p. 444;R.S.1913, § 7868;C.S.1922, § 8813;C.S.1929, § 20-1130;R.S.1943, § 25-1130;Laws 2008, LB1014, § 11.\n\nAnnotations\n\nTrial court can make a reference of an accounting to a referee.
