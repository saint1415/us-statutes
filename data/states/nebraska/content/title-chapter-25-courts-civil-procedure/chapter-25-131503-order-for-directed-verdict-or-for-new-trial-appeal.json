      "text": "25-1315.03.Order for directed verdict or for new trial; appeal.\n\nAn order entering judgment as provided in section 25-1315.02 or granting or denying a new trial is an appealable order. The time for and manner of taking such appeal shall be as in an appeal from a judgment, decree, or final order of the district court in a civil action. On appeal from an order granting a new trial, upon a review of an order denying a new trial in the action in which such motion was made, or on appeal from the judgment, the appellate court may order and direct judgment to be entered in favor of the party who was entitled to such judgment.\n\nSourceLaws 1947, c. 85, § 1(2), p. 263;Laws 1955, c. 89, § 1, p. 263;Laws 1991, LB 732, § 49;Laws 1992, LB 360, § 5.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.

Fellman, 245 Neb. 59, 511 N.W.2d 88 (1994).\n\nOn an appeal from the entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, all parties must preserve all errors on which they rely, alternative or otherwise, by adequate assignments in their respective briefs.
