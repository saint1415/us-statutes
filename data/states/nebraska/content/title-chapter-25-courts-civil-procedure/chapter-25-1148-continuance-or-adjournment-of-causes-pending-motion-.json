After the filing of such application and the affidavits in support thereof, the adverse party shall have the right to file counter affidavits in the matter. Either party may, upon obtaining leave of the court, introduce oral testimony upon the hearing of such application. The court may, upon the hearing, in its discretion, grant or refuse such application, and no reversal of such cause or proceeding shall be had on account of the action of the court in granting or refusing such application except when there has been an abuse of a sound legal discretion by the court.\n\nSourceLaws 1911, c. 39, § 1, p. 205;R.S.1913, § 7889;C.S.1922, § 8831;C.S.1929, § 20-1148;R.S.1943, § 25-1148;Laws 1991, LB 732, § 48.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.

Tuck, 104 Neb. 759, 178 N.W. 612 (1920).\n\nNonattendance of witnesses subpoenaed by plaintiff when the trial commenced is not of itself sufficient ground for a continuance at the request of defendant who relied upon plaintiff's efforts to procure the attendance of such witnesses.

Ronspies, 97 Neb. 656, 150 N.W. 1019 (1915).\n\nOrdinarily failure to have witness subpoenaed and reliance on his promise to appear and testify shows lack of such diligence as requires a continuance in case the witness fails to keep his promise.

Houston, 258 F.Supp. 546 (D. Neb. 1966).\n\n2.

State v. Valdez, 239 Neb. 453, 476 N.W.2d 814 (1991).\n\nThe failure to file a written motion for continuance supported by affidavit is a factor to be considered in determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance.

Santos, 238 Neb. 25, 468 N.W.2d 613 (1991).\n\nGenerally, the denial of a motion for a continuance is a matter for the discretion of the trial court whose ruling will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Perez, 235 Neb. 796, 457 N.W.2d 448 (1990).\n\nThere is no abuse of discretion by the court in denying a request for a continuance unless it appears that the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of that denial.

Hoegerl v. Burt, 215 Neb. 752, 340 N.W.2d 428 (1983).\n\nA trial court may, in a proper case, order a continuance on its own motion and in the absence of a showing of abuse of discretion, its ruling on a motion for a continuance will not be disturbed on appeal. State v. Lee, 195 Neb. 348, 237 N.W.2d 880 (1976).\n\nA motion for continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and in the absence of a showing of an abuse of discretion, a ruling on a motion for continuance will not be disturbed on appeal. Korte v. Betzer, 193 Neb. 15, 225 N.W.2d 30 (1975).\n\nA denial of a party's motion for continuance of a hearing on a motion for new trial is not an abuse of sound legal discretion. Engel v. Mead, 191 Neb. 541, 216 N.W.2d 718 (1974).\n\nIn the absence of a showing in conformance with this section, it is not error for the trial court to refuse to grant a continuance. Metschke v.

State, 159 Neb. 811, 68 N.W.2d 497 (1955).\n\nIn absence of showing of abuse of discretion, denial of continuance is not error. Hyslop v. State, 159 Neb. 802, 68 N.W.2d 698 (1955).\n\nWhere parties agree to continue case beyond day set for trial, and default judgment is entered at request of party violating the agreement for continuance, it is abuse of discretion to overrule motion for new trial.

Co., 114 Neb. 438, 208 N.W. 139 (1926).\n\nRefusal to grant continuance was abuse of discretion under circumstances of case. Richelieu v. Union P. R. R. Co., 97 Neb. 360, 149 N.W. 772 (1914).\n\nNoncompliance with the clear mandates of this section is merely a factor to be considered in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling upon a motion for continuance. State v. Vela-Montes, 19 Neb. App. 378, 807 N.W.2d 544 (2011).\n\nCourts may grant a continuance when the factual basis for granting the motion is wholly or largely dependent upon the oral statements of the prosecutor where the defense does not object to the procedure. State v. Roundtree, 11 Neb. App. 628, 658 N.W.2d 308 (2003).\n\nFailure to comply with this section is relevant as to whether the trial court abused its discretion. In re Interest of Azia B., 10 Neb. App. 124, 626 N.W.2d 602 (2001).\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\nSua sponte judicial delays might be characterized as continuances by the court, but they are not \"applications for continuances\" as described by section 29-1206 and, accordingly, need not be in conformance with the requirements of this section, which describes a hearing on the application and the necessary form of support for applications for continuances or adjournment \"made by a party or parties.\" State v. Chase, 310 Neb. 160, 964 N.W.2d 254 (2021).\n\nThis section and section 29-1206 do not define whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated. State v.
