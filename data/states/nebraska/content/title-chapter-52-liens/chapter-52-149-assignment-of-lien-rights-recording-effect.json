If requested by the owner, the assignee must furnish reasonable proof that an assignment has been made and unless he or she does so, the owner may pay the assignor.\n\n(3) Unless a statement of assignment is recorded, the assignee need not be a party to any judicial proceeding to foreclose a security interest, lien, or other encumbrance.\n\n(4) The failure to record an assignment does not otherwise affect its validity.\n\nSourceLaws 1981, LB 512, § 25.",
