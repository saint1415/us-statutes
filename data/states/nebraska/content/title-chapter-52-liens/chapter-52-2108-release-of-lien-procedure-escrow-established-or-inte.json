      "text": "52-2108.Release of lien; procedure; escrow established or interpleader filed; recording of document required; failure to file; additional procedures.\n\n(1) Whenever a notice of a commercial real estate broker's lien has been recorded, the record owner of the commercial real estate may have the lien released by depositing funds equal to the full amount stated in the notice of lien plus fifteen percent to be applied towards any lien under section 52-2103. These funds shall be held in escrow by such person and by such process which may be agreed to by the parties, either in the commission agreement or otherwise, for the payment to the commercial real estate broker or otherwise for resolution for their dispute or, in the absence of any such mutually agreed person or process, the funds may be deposited with the district court by the filing of an interpleader. Upon such deposit of funds by interpleader, the commercial real estate shall be considered released from such lien or claim of lien. Upon written notice to the commercial real estate broker that the funds have been escrowed or an interpleader filed, the commercial real estate broker shall, within ten business days, record in the office of the register of deeds where the notice of commercial real estate broker's lien was filed pursuant to section 52-2103 a document stating that the lien is released and the commercial real estate released by an escrow established pursuant to this section or by interpleader. If the commercial real estate broker fails to file such document, the person holding the funds may sign and file such document and deduct from the escrow the reasonable cost of preparing and filing the document. Upon the filing of such document, the commercial real estate broker shall be deemed to have an equitable lien on the escrow funds pending a resolution of the commercial real estate broker's claim for payment and the funds shall not be paid to any person, except for such payment to the holder of the funds as set forth in this section, until a resolution of the commercial real estate broker's claim for payment has been agreed to by all necessary parties or ordered by a court having jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a commercial real estate broker's lien has been recorded and an escrow account is established either from the proceeds from the transaction, conveyance, or any other source of funds computed as one hundred fifteen percent of the amount of the claim for lien, then the lien against the commercial real estate shall be extinguished and immediately become a lien on the funds contained in the escrow account. The requirement to establish an escrow account, as provided in this section, shall not be cause for any party to refuse to complete or close the transaction.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB3, § 14.",
