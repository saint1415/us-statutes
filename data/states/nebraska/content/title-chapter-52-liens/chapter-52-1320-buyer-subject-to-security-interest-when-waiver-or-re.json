If a buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products covered by the central filing system tenders to the seller the total purchase price by means of a check or other instrument payable to such seller and each security interest holder of the seller identified in the central filing system for such products and if such security interest holder authorizes the negotiation of such check or other instrument, such authorization or endorsement and payment thereof shall constitute a waiver or release of the security interest specified to the extent of the amount of the instrument. Such waiver or release of the security interest shall not serve to establish or alter in any way security interest or lien priorities under Nebraska law.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, Third Spec.
