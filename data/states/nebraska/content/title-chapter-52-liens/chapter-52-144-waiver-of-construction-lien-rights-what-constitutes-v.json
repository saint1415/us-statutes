Ambiguities in a written waiver are construed against the claimant.\n\n(2) A written waiver waives all construction lien rights of the claimant as to the improvement to which the waiver relates unless the waiver is specifically limited to a particular lien right or a particular portion of the services or materials furnished.\n\n(3) A waiver of lien rights does not affect any contract rights of the claimant otherwise existing.\n\n(4) Acceptance of a promissory note or other evidence of debt is not a waiver of lien rights unless the note or other instrument expressly so declares.\n\nSourceLaws 1981, LB 512, § 20.",
