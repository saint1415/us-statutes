The primary objective of the agricultural use zoning shall be to preserve and protect agricultural activities and the potential for the agricultural, horticultural, or open use of land. Uses to be allowed on such lands include primarily agricultural-related or horticultural-related uses, and nonagricultural or nonhorticultural industrial, commercial, or residential uses allowed on such lands shall be restricted so that they do not conflict with or detract from this objective.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 94, § 5;Laws 1987, LB 679, § 2;Laws 2006, LB 808, § 5;Laws 2019, LB193, § 166.",
