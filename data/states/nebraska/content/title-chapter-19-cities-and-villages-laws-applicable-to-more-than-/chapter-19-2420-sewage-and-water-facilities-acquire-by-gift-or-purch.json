For the purpose of acquiring, maintaining, operating, and extending any such system, any such city may use funds from any sewer, water, or electrical system presently owned and operated by it, without prior appropriation of such funds, and any other funds lawfully available for such purpose.\n\nRates charged for the use of any system or works acquired under this section shall be reasonable and based on cost properly allocable to the customers of such system.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 88, § 1, p. 277;Laws 2019, LB193, § 158.",
