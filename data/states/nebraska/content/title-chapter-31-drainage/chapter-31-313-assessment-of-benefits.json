Each tract or parcel of land, right-of-way, railroad bed, bridge, culvert and depot within the district shall bear its share of the entire cost and expenses incurred by the district in making such works and improvements in proportion to the benefits assessed, whether such improvements be made on the tract or parcel of land, right-of-way, or railroad bed, or not.\n\nSourceLaws 1905, c. 161, § 9, p. 614;Laws 1909, c. 147, § 3, p. 510;R.S.1913, § 1808;C.S.1922, § 1755;C.S.1929, § 31-412;R.S.1943, § 31-313.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIt is sufficient if classification of benefits is made upon a uniform plan which is fair and just. Petersen v. Thurston, 161 Neb. 758, 74 N.W.2d 528 (1956).\n\nWhere drainage district levies assessment for special drainage benefits accruing to land, the levies are not void because an older drainage district previously levied and collected assessments on the same land.
