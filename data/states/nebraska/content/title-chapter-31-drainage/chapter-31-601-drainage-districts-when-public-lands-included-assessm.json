It is further provided that in the event any levies or assessments against the school, university, or other state lands are not paid when due and delinquent, the drainage district may file claims with the Director of Administrative Services for the share of any apportionment to be paid by the lands; and it shall be the duty of the director to draw warrants to be paid from such funds of the state as are available for the payment of such warrants and transmit the same to the treasurer of such drainage district; and the State Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to pay the warrants for the purposes herein set forth.\n\nSourceLaws 1925, c. 17, § 2, p. 86;C.S.1929, § 31-701;R.S.1943, § 31-601;Laws 1999, LB 779, § 1.",
