Such maps shall delineate the flood plain of the base flood and, when information is available, the floodway and flood fringe of such flood plain. Such maps shall also contain or be accompanied by such other information as the department deems appropriate.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 35, § 18;Laws 1993, LB 626, § 5;Laws 2000, LB 900, § 79.",
