Such interest is equivalent to a proportionate equal share with all other participants listed on the certification list for a year of service in (a) the principal amount of all contributions deposited into the annual account for such year of service and (b) all income derived therefrom.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a city, village, or rural or suburban fire protection district from establishing a vesting schedule under which a stated proportion of a participant's interest in his or her annual accounts becomes nonforfeitable upon completion of a specified number of years of service, subject to sections 35-1313, 35-1323, and 35-1329.\n\nSourceLaws 1999, LB 849, § 12;Laws 2001, LB 808, § 11;Laws 2005, LB 268, § 2.",
