For purposes of such vote, the mayor is deemed to be a member of the city council.\n\n(2)(a) Ordinances of a general or permanent nature in a city of the first class shall be read by title on three different days unless three-fourths of the city council members vote to suspend this requirement, except that in a city having a commission plan of government such requirement may be suspended by a three-fifths majority vote.\n\n(b) Regardless of the form of government, such requirement shall not be suspended (i) for any ordinance for the annexation of territory or the redrawing of boundaries for city council election districts or wards or (ii) as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(c) In case such requirement is suspended, the ordinances shall be read by title or number and then moved for final passage.\n\n(d) Three-fourths of the city council members may require a reading of any such ordinance in full before enactment under either procedure set out in this section, except that in a city having a commission plan of government, such reading may be required by a three-fifths majority vote.\n\n(3) Ordinances in a city of the first class shall contain no subject which is not clearly expressed in the title, and, except as provided in section 19-915, no ordinance or section thereof shall be revised or amended unless the new ordinance contains the entire ordinance or section as revised or amended and the ordinance or section so amended is repealed, except that:\n\n(a) For an ordinance revising all the ordinances of a city of the first class, the only title necessary shall be An ordinance of the city of .........., revising all the ordinances of the city.
