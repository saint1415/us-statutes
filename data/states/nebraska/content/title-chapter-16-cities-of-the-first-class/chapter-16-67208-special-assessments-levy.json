The special assessment may be relevied if, for any reason, the levy thereof is void or not enforceable and in an amount not exceeding the previous levy. Such levy shall be enforced as special assessments for street improvements are enforced in cities of the first class, and any payments thereon, made under previous levies, shall be credited to the property involved. All assessments made for such purposes shall be collected in the same manner as general taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties.\n\nSourceLaws 1961, c. 46, § 8, p. 181;Laws 2016, LB704, § 132.",
