The city shall pay these employee contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the employee. The city shall pick up these contributions by a salary deduction either through a reduction in the cash salary of the employee or a combination of a reduction in salary and offset against a future salary increase. A police officer shall not be given an option to choose to receive the amount of the required contribution in lieu of having such contribution paid directly to the retirement system.\n\n(3) Each police officer shall be entitled to make voluntary cash contributions to the retirement system in an amount not to exceed the contribution limitations established by the Internal Revenue Code. Voluntary contributions shall be credited to the police officer's employee account and shall thereafter be credited with regular interest. A police officer's voluntary contribution shall become a part of the Police Officers Retirement System Fund and shall be held, administered, invested, and distributed in the same manner as any other employee contribution to the retirement system.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 237, § 5;Laws 1992, LB 672, § 9;Laws 1995, LB 574, § 19;Laws 2012, LB1082, § 5;Laws 2025, LB179, § 1.Operative Date: September 3, 2025",
