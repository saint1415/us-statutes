      "text": "87-303.12.Copy of pleadings, orders, judgments, and notices; provided to Attorney General; right to intervene.\n\n(1) A party filing a petition, counterclaim, cross-petition, or pleading in intervention alleging a violation under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, within seven days following the date of filing such pleading, shall provide a copy to the Attorney General and, within seven days following entry of any final judgment in the action, shall provide a copy of the judgment to the Attorney General. This subsection does not apply to Small Claims Court actions, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.\n\n(2) A party appealing a Small Claims Court order or judgment to district court involving an issue raised under the act, within seven days of providing notice of the appeal, shall notify the Attorney General in writing and provide a copy of the pleading raising the issue and a copy of the Small Claims Court order or judgment.\n\n(3) A party appealing an order or judgment involving an issue raised under the act, within seven days following the date such notice of appeal is filed with the court, shall notify the Attorney General in writing and provide a copy of the pleading raising the issue and a copy of the court order or judgment being appealed.\n\n(4) Upon timely application to the court in which an action involving an issue raised under the act is pending, the Attorney General may intervene as a party at any time or may be heard at any time. The Attorney General's failure to intervene shall not preclude the Attorney General from bringing a separate enforcement action.\n\n(5) All copies of pleadings, orders, judgments, and notices required by this section to be sent to the Attorney General shall be sent by certified mail unless the Attorney General has previously been provided such copies of the pleadings, orders, judgments, or notices in the same action by certified mail, in which case subsequent mailings may be made by regular mail. Failure to provide the required mailings to the Attorney General shall not be grounds for dismissal of an action under the act, but may be grounds for a subsequent action by the Attorney General to vacate or modify the judgment.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB801, § 4.",
