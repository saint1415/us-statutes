The personal data described by this subsection is subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.\n\n(3) A controller that processes personal data under an exemption in sections 87-1126 to 87-1129 bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing of the personal data qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section.\n\n(4) The processing of personal data by an entity for the purposes described by section 87-1126 does not solely make the entity a controller with respect to the processing of the data.\n\nSourceLaws 2024, LB1074, § 29.",
