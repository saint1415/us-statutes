Notwithstanding the requirements of article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, on filing notice of a security interest, the dealer shall have a continuing security interest in the inventory or tools until payment by the supplier and shall be treated the same as if the dealer still had possession of the inventory or tools.\n\n(4) This section shall not require the supplier to repurchase from the dealer:\n\n(a) Any repair part or attachment which has a limited storage life or is otherwise subject to deterioration;\n\n(b) Any repair part or attachment which is priced as a set of two or more items if the set is incomplete;\n\n(c) Any repair part or attachment which because of its condition is not resalable as a new part or attachment without repairing or reconditioning;\n\n(d) Any repair part or attachment which is not in new, unused, and undamaged condition;\n\n(e) Any equipment which is not in new, unused, undamaged, and complete condition;\n\n(f) Any inventory for which the dealer is unable to furnish evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the supplier, of good title free and clear of all claims, liens, and encumbrances;\n\n(g) Any inventory which was ordered by the dealer on or after the date of receipt of the notification of termination of the dealer agreement; or\n\n(h) Any inventory which was acquired by the dealer from any source other than the supplier or the supplier's predecessor in interest.\n\n(5) If any supplier fails or refuses to repurchase any inventory or specialized repair tools subject to this section within ninety days after the date the supplier takes possession, the supplier shall be civilly liable for (a) one hundred percent of the net cost of the equipment and of the current price of the attachments, repair parts, and tools, (b) any freight charges paid by the dealer, and (c) all costs of financing such repurchase, including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the existence or enforcement of a security interest which any person may have in the inventory or tools of the dealer.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 123, § 7;Laws 1999, LB 550, § 50.",
