Disclosure of a data protection assessment in compliance with a request from the Attorney General does not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work-product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.\n\n(5) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.\n\n(6) A data protection assessment conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may constitute compliance with the requirements of this section if the assessment has a reasonably comparable scope and effect.\n\nSourceLaws 2024, LB1074, § 16.",
