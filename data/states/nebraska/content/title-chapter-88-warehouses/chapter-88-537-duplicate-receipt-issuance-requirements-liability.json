The delivery of the grain or the issuance of a duplicate receipt pursuant to the approval of the commission shall not relieve the warehouse licensee from liability to a person to whom the negotiable receipt has been or will be negotiated for value without notice of the proceedings before the commission or of the delivery of the grain or the issuance of the duplicate receipt pursuant to such proceedings.\n\nSourceLaws 1987, LB 164, § 13.",
