The board shall provide notice to the other party to the disagreement at least fifteen days prior to the hearing. After the hearing is completed the board shall, within forty-five days, enter an order setting forth its decision on the issues in disagreement and the disposition of the dispute, taking into consideration whether the relief requested by the complaining party is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and will place no undue burden upon the parties affected thereby. Any provision in an order of the board regarding any rate to be charged by a public power district or public power and irrigation district which has agreed with the holders of its outstanding bonds that the district will fix such rates shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the district.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 421, § 5, p. 1296;Laws 1969, c. 550, § 4, p. 2207.",
