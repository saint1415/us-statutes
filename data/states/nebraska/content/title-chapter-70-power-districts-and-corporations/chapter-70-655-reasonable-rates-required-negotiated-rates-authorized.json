Any negotiated rates, tolls, rents, and other charges for a commercial or industrial customer shall be effective for no more than five years and in no case shall such rates, tolls, rents, and charges include a production component that is less than the incremental production cost of supplying such services if (a) such customer has entered an agreement with the state or any political subdivision to provide an economic development project pursuant to state or local law and (b) such economic development project has projected new or additional electrical load requirements greater than five hundred kilowatts and a minimum annual load demand factor of sixty percent during the applicable billing period. This subsection shall also apply to any nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of furnishing electric service pursuant to the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act or the Nebraska Nonprofit Corporation Act, any agency created pursuant to the Municipal Cooperative Financing Act, and any municipality engaged in furnishing electrical service to customers at retail or wholesale.\n\n(3) In order to facilitate the merger and consolidation of districts, the board of directors of a merged or consolidated district may negotiate, fix, establish, and collect rates, tolls, rents, and other charges for consumers in the service area of one or more of the predecessor districts which are different than rates, tolls, rents, and other charges for consumers in the remaining service area of the merged or consolidated district. Any different rates, tolls, rents, and other charges pursuant to this subsection shall be effective for no more than five years after the date of merger or consolidation and shall be based on cost of service or other rate studies showing that adoption of dissimilar rates for consumers in otherwise similar rate classes is needed to effectuate the merger or consolidation. This subsection shall also apply in the event of a merger or consolidation of any nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of furnishing electric service pursuant to the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act or the Nebraska Nonprofit Corporation Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1933, c. 86, § 13, p. 353;Laws 1937, c. 152, § 8, p. 589;Laws 1939, c. 89, § 1, p. 388;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 70-713;R.S.1943, § 70-655;Laws 1981, LB 181, § 26;Laws 1986, LB 1230, § 47;Laws 1995, LB 828, § 2;Laws 2001, LB 243, § 1;Laws 2005, LB 139, § 16;Laws 2012, LB1043, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesElectric Cooperative Corporation Act, see section 70-701.Municipal Cooperative Financing Act, see section 18-2401.Nebraska Nonprofit Corporation Act, see section 21-1901.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA discount provided only to wholesale customers who renewed their contractual relationship with Nebraska Public Power District was not discriminatory under the circumstances.
