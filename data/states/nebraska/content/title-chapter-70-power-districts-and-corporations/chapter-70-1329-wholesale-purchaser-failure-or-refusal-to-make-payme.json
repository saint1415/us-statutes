If the court issues a writ of mandamus and the purchaser gives the written notice of disputed issues as required by section 70-1304 the matter shall proceed to arbitration as provided by sections 70-1301 to 70-1329. If the court declines to issue a writ of mandamus, it shall nevertheless retain jurisdiction of the matter for the purpose of determining the amount due to the supplier.\n\nSourceLaws 1979, LB 207, § 29.",
