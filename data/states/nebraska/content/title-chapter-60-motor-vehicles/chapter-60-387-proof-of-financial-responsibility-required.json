Evidence of insurance in the form of a certificate of insurance for fleet vehicles may include, as an appropriate reference, a designation that the insurance coverage is applicable to all vehicles owned by the named insured, or wording of similar effect, in lieu of an explicit description. Proof of financial responsibility also may be evidenced by (1) a check by the department or its agents of the motor vehicle insurance database created under section 60-3,136 or (2) any other automated or electronic means as prescribed or developed by the department. For purposes of this section, fleet means a group of at least five vehicles that belong to the same owner.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 274, § 87;Laws 2007, LB286, § 34.\n\nAnnotations\n\nRecent legislative enactments to make automobile liability insurance compulsory could not be read retroactively in violation of vested rights under the policy, where the enactments were not in force when the policy was issued or when the loss occurred.
