The owner may receive a refund or credit of the registration fees and motor vehicle taxes and fees for the unexpired months remaining in the registration year determined based on the date when the motor vehicle or trailer was damaged and became unavailable for service. When the owner registers a replacement motor vehicle or trailer at the time of filing such affidavit, the credit may be immediately applied against the registration fee and the motor vehicle tax and fee for the replacement motor vehicle or trailer. When no such replacement motor vehicle or trailer is so registered, the county treasurer shall refund the unused registration fees. If the motor vehicle or trailer was damaged and became unavailable for service during the same month in which it was registered, no refund or credit shall be allowed for such month. When any such motor vehicle or trailer is reregistered within the same registration year in which its registration has been canceled, the taxes and fees shall be that portion of the registration fee and the motor vehicle tax and fee for the remainder of the registration year.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 274, § 97;Laws 2007, LB286, § 36;Laws 2012, LB801, § 63.",
