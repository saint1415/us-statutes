The director shall issue certificates in the manner and form prescribed by the director to no more than two motorcycle trainers who meet the minimum education, skill, and experience requirements. The department may reimburse documented expenses incurred by a person in connection with taking and successfully passing an educational course to become a motorcycle trainer, as provided in sections 81-1174 to 81-1177, when there are less than two motorcycle trainers working in this state. In return for the reimbursement of such documented expenses, motorcycle trainers shall teach the motorcycle safety instructor preparation course as assigned by the director.\n\n(2) If the certification requirements are comparable to the requirements in this state, a person currently certified as a motorcycle trainer by another state or recognized accrediting organization may be issued a motorcycle trainer's certificate by the department without having to receive the training required by this section.\n\n(3) A person who holds a valid, unexpired permit issued by the department to be a chief instructor for motorcycle safety before January 1, 2012, shall be recognized as a motorcycle trainer until January 1, 2014, or until the expiration date of such permit, whichever is earlier.
