After notation, the county treasurer or the department shall deliver the corrected certificate of title to the holder as provided by section 60-152. If a holder fails to deliver a certificate of title to the county treasurer or to the department, within fifteen days after the date on the notice for the purpose of noting such brand or lien on the certificate of title, the department shall cancel the certificate of title. This subsection does not apply when noting a lien in accordance with subsection (6) of section 60-164.\n\n(2) The department may remove a lien on a certificate of title when such lien was improperly noted if evidence of the improperly noted lien is submitted to the department and the department finds the evidence sufficient to support removal of the lien. The department shall send notification prior to removal of the lien to the last-known address of the lienholder. The lienholder must respond within thirty days after the date on the notice and provide sufficient evidence to support that the lien should not be removed. If the lienholder fails to respond to the notice, the lien may be removed by the department.\n\nSourceLaws 2007, LB286, § 17;Laws 2009, LB202, § 19;Laws 2012, LB801, § 43;Laws 2018, LB909, § 30.",
