      "text": "60-142.03.Recognized car club; qualified car club representative; department; powers and duties.\n\n(1) For purposes of this section, car club means an organization that has members with knowledge of and expertise pertaining to authentic vehicles and that has members with knowledge of and expertise pertaining to the restoration and preservation of specific makes and models of vehicles using replacement parts that are essentially the same in design and material to that originally supplied by the manufacturer for a specific year, make, and model of vehicle.\n\n(2) To become a recognized car club, a car club shall apply to the department. For a car club to become recognized, it must be a nonprofit organization with established bylaws and at least twenty members. The applicant shall provide a copy of the bylaws and a membership list to the department. The department shall determine if a car club qualifies as a recognized car club. The determination of the department shall be final and nonappealable.\n\n(3) A member of a recognized car club may apply to the department to become a qualified car club representative. Each qualified car club representative shall be designated by the president or director of the local chapter of the recognized car club of which he or she is a member. The department shall identify and maintain a list of qualified car club representatives. A qualified car club representative may apply to be placed on the list of qualified car club representatives by providing the department with his or her name, address, and telephone number, the name, address, and telephone number of the recognized car club he or she represents, a copy of the designation of the representative by the president or director of the local chapter of the recognized car club, and such other information as may be required by the department. The department may place a qualified car club representative on the list upon receipt of a completed application and may provide each representative with information for inspection of vehicles and parts. The determination of the department regarding designation of an individual as a qualified car club representative and placement on the list of qualified car club representatives shall be final and nonappealable. The department shall distribute the list to county treasurers.\n\n(4) When a qualified car club representative inspects vehicles and replacement parts, he or she shall determine whether all major component parts used in the assembly of a vehicle are original or essentially the same in design and material to that originally supplied by the manufacturer for the specific year, make, and model of vehicle, including the appropriate engine, body material, body shape, and other requirements as prescribed by the department. After such inspection, the representative shall provide the owner with a statement in the form prescribed by the department which includes the findings of the inspection. No qualified car club representative shall charge any fee for the inspection or the statement. No qualified car club representative shall provide a statement for any vehicle owned by such representative or any member of his or her immediate family.\n\n(5) The director may summarily remove a person from the list of qualified car club representatives upon written notice. Such person may reapply for inclusion on the list upon presentation of suitable evidence satisfying the director that the cause for removal from the list has been corrected, eliminated, no longer exists, or will not affect or interfere with the person's judgment or qualifications for inspection of vehicles to determine whether or not any replacement parts are essentially the same in design and material to that originally supplied by the original manufacturer for the specific year, make, and model of vehicle.\n\n(6) The department may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this section.\n\nSourceLaws 2006, LB 663, § 8;Laws 2012, LB801, § 28.",
