All other persons or providers shall reapply for certification. A person or provider may contest action taken by the director to cancel, suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew a certificate by filing a written petition with the department within thirty days after the date of the director's action.\n\nSourceLaws 1981, LB 22, § 7;R.S.1943, (1984), § 60-2115;Laws 1986, LB 1004, § 13;Laws 1989, LB 285, § 136;Laws 1999, LB 704, § 48;Laws 2011, LB170, § 12.",
