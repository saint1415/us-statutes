      "text": "60-376.Operation of vehicle without registration; In Transit sticker; records required; proof of ownership.\n\nSubject to all the provisions of law relating to motor vehicles and trailers not inconsistent with this section, any motor vehicle dealer or trailer dealer who is regularly engaged within this state in the business of buying and selling motor vehicles and trailers, who regularly maintains within this state an established place of business, and who desires to effect delivery of any motor vehicle or trailer bought or sold by him or her from the point where purchased or sold to points within or outside this state may, solely for the purpose of such delivery by himself or herself, his or her agent, or a bona fide purchaser, operate such motor vehicle or tow such trailer on the highways of this state without charge or registration of such motor vehicle or trailer. A sticker shall be displayed on the front and rear windows or the rear side windows of such motor vehicle, except an autocycle or a motorcycle, and displayed on the front and rear of each such trailer. On the sticker shall be plainly printed in black letters the words In Transit. One In Transit sticker shall be displayed on an autocycle or a motorcycle, which sticker may be one-half the size required for other motor vehicles. Such stickers shall include a registration number, which registration number shall be different for each sticker or pair of stickers issued, and the contents of such sticker and the numbering system shall be as prescribed by the department. Each dealer issuing such stickers shall keep a record of the registration number of each sticker or pair of stickers on the invoice of such sale. Such sticker shall allow such owner to operate the motor vehicle or tow such trailer for a period of thirty days in order to effect proper registration of the new or used motor vehicle or trailer. When any person, firm, or corporation has had a motor vehicle or trailer previously registered and license plates assigned to such person, firm, or corporation, such owner may operate the motor vehicle or tow such trailer for a period of thirty days in order to effect transfer of plates to the new or used motor vehicle or trailer. Upon demand of proper authorities, there shall be presented by the person in charge of such motor vehicle or trailer, for examination, a duly executed bill of sale therefor or other satisfactory evidence of the right of possession by such person of such motor vehicle or trailer.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 274, § 76;Laws 2008, LB756, § 12;Laws 2015, LB231, § 10.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA vehicle may be operated for 15 days without being registered pursuant to section 60-302, provided that it properly displays \"In Transit\" decals. State v. Childs, 242 Neb. 426, 495 N.W.2d 475 (1993).\n\nThis section provides for in-transit tags to be issued by a licensed dealer; it does not allow private sellers to issue in-transit tags. Thus, such handwritten tags are not entitled to the presumption of compliance that we have afforded dealer-issued tags. The law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion to stop a motor vehicle when he or she sees such vehicle being operated on the public streets without license plates and without dealer-issued in-transit tags. Upon demand, the driver of such vehicle must show documents proving compliance with motor vehicle registration laws. State v. Kling, 8 Neb. App. 631, 599 N.W.2d 240 (1999).\n\n\"Display\" of in-transit decals as described in this section logically implies a display of the decal which is visible. State v. Reiter, 3 Neb. App. 153, 524 N.W.2d 575 (1994).",
