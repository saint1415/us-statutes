In case the property cannot be divided or removed, the county receiving the same shall pay to the other a proportionate value for the same.\n\nSourceLaws 1879, § 16, p. 358;R.S.1913, § 926;C.S.1922, § 832;C.S.1929, § 25-215;R.S.1943, § 22-215;Laws 1979, LB 187, § 90;Laws 1992, LB 719A, § 91.\n\nAnnotations\n\nBalance in bridge fund divided in proportion to the relative assessed valuation of counties.
