A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the installment sales contract.

The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for filing, perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security interest in the goods or services.\n\nSourceLaws 2025, LB474, § 87.Operative Date: October 1, 2025",
