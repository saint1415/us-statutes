The licensee shall not charge the maker any interest or additional fees during the term of the extended payment plan.\n\n(5) If the maker fails to pay any extended payment plan installment when due, the maker shall be in default of the payment plan and the licensee immediately may accelerate payment on the remaining balance. Upon default, the licensee may take action to collect all amounts due.\n\nSourceLaws 2018, LB194, § 15.",
