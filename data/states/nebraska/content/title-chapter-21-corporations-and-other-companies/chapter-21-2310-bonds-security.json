Each pledge, agreement, mortgage, and deed of trust made for the benefit of security of any of the bonds of the corporation shall continue to be effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the pledge, agreement, mortgage, and deed of trust were made shall have been fully paid. In the event of default in payment or in any agreements of the corporation made as a part of the contract under which the bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or in any mortgage or deed of trust executed as security for the bonds, the rights of the bondholders may be enforced by mandamus, the appointment of a receiver in equity, or by foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust, or any one or more of the remedies.SourceLaws 1972, LB 1517, § 11;Laws 1995, LB 494, § 10.",
