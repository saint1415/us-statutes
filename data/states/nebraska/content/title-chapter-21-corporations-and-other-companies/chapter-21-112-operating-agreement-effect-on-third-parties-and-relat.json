An amendment is ineffective if its adoption does not include the required approval or satisfy the specified condition.\n\n(b) The obligations of a limited liability company and its members to a person in the person's capacity as a transferee or dissociated member are governed by the operating agreement. Subject only to any court order issued under subdivision (b)(2) of section 21-142 to effectuate a charging order, an amendment to the operating agreement made after a person becomes a transferee or dissociated member is effective with regard to any debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited liability company or its members to the person in the person's capacity as a transferee or dissociated member.\n\n(c) If a record that has been delivered by a limited liability company to the Secretary of State for filing and has become effective under the Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act contains a provision that would be ineffective under subsection (b) of section 21-110 if contained in the operating agreement, the provision is likewise ineffective in the record.\n\n(d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a record that has been delivered by a limited liability company to the Secretary of State for filing and has become effective under the act conflicts with a provision of the operating agreement:\n\n(1) the operating agreement prevails as to members, dissociated members, transferees, and managers; and\n\n(2) the record prevails as to other persons to the extent they reasonably rely on the record.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB888, § 12.",
