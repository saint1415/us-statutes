The consent may specify the time at which the action taken thereunder is to be effective. A director's consent may be withdrawn by a revocation signed by the director and delivered to the corporation prior to delivery to the corporation of unrevoked written consents signed by all the directors.\n\n(c) A consent signed under this section has the effect of action taken at a meeting of the board of directors and may be described as such in any document.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB749, § 96.",
