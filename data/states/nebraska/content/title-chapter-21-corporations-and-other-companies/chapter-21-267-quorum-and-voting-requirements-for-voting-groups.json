Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.\n\n(b) Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.\n\n(c) If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation require a greater number of affirmative votes.\n\n(d) An amendment of articles of incorporation adding, changing, or deleting a quorum or voting requirement for a voting group greater than specified in subsection (a) or (c) of this section is governed by section 21-269.\n\n(e) The election of directors is governed by section 21-270.\n\n(f) Whenever a provision of the Nebraska Model Business Corporation Act provides for voting of classes or series as separate voting groups, the rules provided in subsection (c) of section 21-2,153 for amendments of articles of incorporation apply to that provision.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB749, § 67.",
