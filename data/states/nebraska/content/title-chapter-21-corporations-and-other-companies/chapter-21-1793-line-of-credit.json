When a line of credit has been approved, no additional credit application shall be required as long as the aggregate indebtedness of the line of credit with the credit union does not exceed the approved limit. The credit union may, at its option, require reapplication for a line of credit either periodically or as circumstances warrant.\n\n(2) A line of credit shall be subject to a periodic review by the credit union in accordance with the written policies of the board of directors.\n\nSourceLaws 1996, LB 948, § 93.",
