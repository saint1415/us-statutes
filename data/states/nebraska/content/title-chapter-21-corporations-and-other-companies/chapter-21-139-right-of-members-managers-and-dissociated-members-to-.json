The company shall respond to a demand made pursuant to this subsection in the manner provided in subdivision (b)(3) of this section.\n\n(d) A limited liability company may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.\n\n(e) A member or dissociated member may exercise rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal disability, a legal representative. Any restriction or condition imposed by the operating agreement or under subsection (g) of this section applies both to the agent or legal representative and the member or dissociated member.\n\n(f) The rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee.\n\n(g) In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its operating agreement, a limited liability company, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the company has the burden of proving reasonableness.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB888, § 39.",
