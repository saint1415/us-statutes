A person's dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution.\n\n(c) A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than money. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of section 21-154, a limited liability company may distribute an asset in kind if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person's share of distributions.\n\n(d) If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB888, § 33.",
