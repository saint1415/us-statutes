In order to be effective, the amendment must be adopted by at least the minimum status vote.\n\n(2) If a plan of merger, conversion, or share exchange would have the effect of terminating the status of a business corporation as a benefit corporation, the plan must be adopted by at least the minimum status vote in order to be effective.
