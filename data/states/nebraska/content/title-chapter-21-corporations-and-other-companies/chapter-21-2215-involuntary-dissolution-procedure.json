The Attorney General shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the corporation at its last-known registered office or mailing address within ten days after the first publication thereof. The certificate of the Attorney General of the mailing of such notice shall be prima facie evidence thereof. Such notice shall be published at least once each week for two successive weeks, and the first publication thereof may begin at any time after the summons has been returned. Unless a corporation shall have been served with summons, no default shall be taken against it earlier than thirty days after the first publication of such notice.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 121, § 15, p. 559.",
