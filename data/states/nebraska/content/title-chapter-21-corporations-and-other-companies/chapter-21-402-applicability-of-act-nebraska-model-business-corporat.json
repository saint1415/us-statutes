The act does not affect a statute or rule of law that is applicable to a business corporation that is not a benefit corporation.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in the Nebraska Benefit Corporation Act, the Nebraska Model Business Corporation Act is generally applicable to all benefit corporations. The specific provisions of the Nebraska Benefit Corporation Act control over the general provisions of the Nebraska Model Business Corporation Act. A benefit corporation may be subject simultaneously to the Nebraska Benefit Corporation Act and one or more other statutes that provide for the incorporation of a specific type of business corporation.\n\n(4) A provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a benefit corporation may not limit, be inconsistent with, or supersede a provision of the Nebraska Benefit Corporation Act.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB751, § 2;Laws 2015, LB35, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Model Business Corporation Act, see section 21-201.",
