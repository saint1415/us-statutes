Qualifications must be reasonable as applied to the corporation and must be lawful.\n\n(b) A requirement that is based on a past, current, or prospective action, or expression of an opinion, by a nominee or director that could limit the ability of a nominee or director to discharge his or her duties as a director is not a permissible qualification under this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, qualifications may include not being or having been subject to specified criminal, civil, or regulatory sanctions or not having been removed as a director by judicial action or for cause.\n\n(c) A director need not be a resident of this state or a shareholder of the corporation unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws so prescribe.\n\n(d) A qualification for nomination for director prescribed before a person's nomination shall apply to such person at the time of nomination. A qualification for nomination for director prescribed after a person's nomination shall not apply to such person with respect to such nomination.\n\n(e) A qualification for director prescribed before the start of a director's term may apply only at the time an individual becomes a director or may apply during a director's term. A qualification prescribed during a director's term shall not apply to that director before the end of that term.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB749, § 85;Laws 2017, LB35, § 14.",
