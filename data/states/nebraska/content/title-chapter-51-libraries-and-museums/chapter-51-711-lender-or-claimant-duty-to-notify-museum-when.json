Failure to notify the museum of these changes may result in the lender's or claimant's loss of rights in the property.\n\n(2) The lender or claimant of property on loan to a museum may file with the museum a notice of intent to preserve an interest in the property as provided for in section 51-706. The filing of a notice of intent to preserve an interest in property on loan to a museum does not validate or make enforceable any claim which would be extinguished under the terms of a written agreement or which would otherwise be invalid or unenforceable.\n\nSourceLaws 1996, LB 1276, § 11.",
