If the museum does not intend to retain a notice for this reason, the museum shall promptly notify the claimant at the address given on the notice that the museum believes the notice is ineffective to preserve an interest and the reasons for the insufficiency. The fact that a museum retains a notice under section 51-710 does not mean that the museum accepts the sufficiency or accuracy of the notice or that the notice is effective to preserve an interest in property on loan to the museum.\n\nSourceLaws 1996, LB 1276, § 6.",
