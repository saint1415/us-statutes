The lien may be established and enforced in the same manner as is provided by sections 57-801 to 57-820. For such purposes any nonconsenting owner shall be deemed to have contracted with the unit operator for his proportionate part of the cost of developing and operating the unit area.\n\nSourceLaws 1965, c. 343, § 11, p. 980.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe possible advantage in delay to nonpooling owners by being carried or otherwise financed may be lessened or offset by allowance of a cost item for risk capital.
