The risk of all payments made to the original contractor shall be upon the owner after the receipt of notice that a lien is claimed and has been filed as herein provided by a person other than the original contractor. An owner shall not have the right to offset obligations of the original contractor unless such obligations arise out of the original contract.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 241, § 7, p. 811.",
