The Legislature further finds and declares that private transfer fee obligations violate this public policy by impairing the marketability and transferability of real property and by constituting an unreasonable restraint on alienation regardless of the duration of the obligation to pay a private transfer fee, the amount of a private transfer fee, or the method by which any private transfer fee is created or imposed. The Legislature finds and declares that a private transfer fee obligation should not run with the title to property or otherwise bind subsequent owners of property under any common-law or equitable principle.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB26, § 2.",
