If the owners of the adjoining units have specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the application must state the proposed reallocations. Unless the executive board determines within thirty days that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment that identifies the units involved, states the reallocations, is executed by those unit owners, and contains words of conveyance between them.\n\n(b) The association shall prepare and record plats or plans necessary to show the altered boundaries between adjoining units and their dimensions and identifying numbers.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 433, § 25;Laws 1984, LB 1105, § 4.",
