Walters v. Sporer, 298 Neb. 536, 905 N.W.2d 70 (2017).\n\nAssignment of a vendee's vested equitable interest in land, acquired by land contract, creates a privity of estate between the assignee and the original vendor, but not a privity of contract between them. Beren Corp. v. Spader, 198 Neb. 677, 255 N.W.2d 247 (1977).\n\nExtent of reservation of mineral rights was obscure and ambiguous, and required construction of deed. Gettel v. Hester, 165 Neb. 573, 86 N.W.2d 613 (1957).\n\nInterest in oil and gas rights was reserved. Elrod v. Heirs of Gifford, 156 Neb. 269, 55 N.W.2d 673 (1952).",
