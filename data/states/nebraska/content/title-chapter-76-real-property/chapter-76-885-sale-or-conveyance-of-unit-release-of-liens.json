This subsection does not apply to any real estate which a declarant has the right to withdraw.\n\n(b) Before conveying real estate to the association the declarant shall have that real estate released from: (1) all liens the foreclosure of which would deprive unit owners of any right of access to or easement of support of their units, and (2) all other liens on that real estate unless the public-offering statement describes certain real estate which may be conveyed subject to liens in specified amounts.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 433, § 61.",
