      "text": "76-1002.Transfers in trust; real property; purpose.\n\n(1) Transfers in trust of real property may be made to secure (a) existing debts or obligations, (b) debts or obligations created simultaneously with the execution of the trust deed, (c) future advances necessary to protect the security, even though such future advances cause the total indebtedness to exceed the maximum amount stated in the trust deed, (d) any future advances to be made at the option of the parties in any amount unless, except as otherwise provided under subsection (2) or (3) of this section, a maximum amount of total indebtedness to be secured is stated in the trust deed, or (e) the performance of an obligation of any other person named in the trust deed to a beneficiary.\n\n(2) Future advances necessary to protect the security shall include, but not be limited to, advances for payment of real property taxes, special assessments, prior liens, hazard insurance premiums, maintenance charges imposed under a condominium declaration or other covenant, and costs of repair, maintenance, or improvements. Future advances necessary to protect the security are secured by the trust deed and shall have the priority specified in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(3)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this subsection, all items identified in subsection (1) of this section are equally secured by the trust deed from the time of filing the trust deed as provided by law and have the same priority as the trust deed over the rights of all other persons who acquire any rights in or liens upon the trust property subsequent to the time the trust deed was filed.\n\n(b)(i) The trustor or his or her successor in title may limit the amount of optional future advances secured by the trust deed under subdivision (1)(d) of this section by filing a notice for record in the office of the register of deeds of each county in which the trust property or some part thereof is situated. A copy of such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the beneficiary at the address of the beneficiary set forth in the trust deed or, if the trust deed has been assigned, to the address of the most recent assignee reflected in a recorded assignment of the trust deed. The amount of such secured optional future advances shall be limited to not less than the amount actually advanced at the time of receipt of such notice by the beneficiary.\n\n(ii) If any optional future advance is made by the beneficiary to the trustor or his or her successor in title after receiving written notice of the filing for record of any trust deed, mortgage, lien, or claim against such trust property, then the amount of such optional future advance shall be junior to such trust deed, mortgage, lien, or claim. The notice under this subdivision shall be sent by certified mail to the beneficiary at the address of the beneficiary set forth in the trust deed or, if the trust deed has been assigned, to the address of the most recent assignee reflected in a recorded assignment of the trust deed.\n\n(iii) Subdivisions (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection shall not limit or determine the priority of optional future advances as against construction liens governed by section 52-139.\n\n(4) The reduction to zero or elimination of the obligation evidenced by any of the transfers in trust authorized by this section shall not invalidate the operation of this section as to any future advances unless a notice or release to the contrary is filed for record as provided by law. All right, title, interest, and claim in and to the trust property acquired by the trustor or his or her successors in interest subsequent to the execution of the trust deed shall inure to the trustee as security for the obligation or obligations for which the trust property is conveyed in like manner as if acquired before execution of the trust deed.\n\nSourceLaws 1965, c. 451, § 2, p. 1424;Laws 1984, LB 679, § 17;Laws 1988, LB 984, § 1;Laws 1999, LB 277, § 1;Laws 2002, LB 876, § 80;Laws 2002, LB 957, § 31;Laws 2011, LB43, § 1;Laws 2014, LB788, § 11.",
