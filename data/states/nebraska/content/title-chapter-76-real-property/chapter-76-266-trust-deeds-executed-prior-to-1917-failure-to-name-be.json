In all actions which may be brought after July 24, 1919, by any person claiming a right or interest in or to said real estate, or a lien thereon adverse to such conveyance, assignment or release by said trustee, the presumption that such trustee had power and authority to make such conveyance, assignment or release shall be conclusive.\n\nSourceLaws 1917, c. 223, § 6, p. 547;C.S.1922, § 5659;C.S.1929, § 76-265;R.S.1943, § 76-266.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIf no declaration of terms of trust have been recorded, trustee holding legal title will be conclusively presumed to have had authority to enter into lease. Bauer v. Bauer, 136 Neb. 329, 285 N.W. 565 (1939).\n\nMere insertion of trustee after name of patentee does not prevent grantee from transferring to another where trust is not disclosed. Perry v. Ritze, 110 Neb. 286, 193 N.W. 758 (1923).",
