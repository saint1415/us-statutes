For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that the homeowner has a reasonable ability to make lease payments and to repurchase the residence in foreclosure if the homeowner's payments for primary housing expenses and regular principal and interest payments on other personal debt do not exceed sixty percent of the homeowner's monthly gross income; and(5) The price the homeowner must pay to exercise the option to repurchase the residence in foreclosure is not unconscionable. Without limitation on available claims under section 76-2726, a repurchase price exceeding twenty-five percent of the price at which the equity purchaser acquired the residence in foreclosure creates a rebuttable presumption that the reconveyance contract is unconscionable. The acquisition price paid by the equity purchaser may include any actual costs incurred by the equity purchaser in acquiring the residence in foreclosure, including repairs and capital improvements, and may include below market rent discounts. The equity purchaser shall provide the homeowner with documentation proving such costs and below market rent discounts prior to the homeowner's exercise of the option to purchase.SourceLaws 2008, LB123, § 23.",
