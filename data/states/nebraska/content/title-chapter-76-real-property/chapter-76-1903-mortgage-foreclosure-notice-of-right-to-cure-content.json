The right to cure provided by this section shall expire two months from the date the notice of right to cure is sent to the mortgagor.\n\n(4) If the default is cured prior to the expiration of the two-month period, any action previously commenced shall be dismissed and the mortgage and the obligation thereby secured shall be reinstated and shall be and remain in force and effect the same as if no default or acceleration had occurred.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, Third Spec.
