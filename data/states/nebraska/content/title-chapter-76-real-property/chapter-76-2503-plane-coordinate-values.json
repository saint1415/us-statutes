When the values are expressed in feet, a definition of one foot equals 0.3048 meters exactly must be used. One of the distances, to be known as the \"northing or y-coordinate\", shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. The other, to be known as the \"easting or x-coordinate\", shall give the position in an east-and-west direction.\n\nSourceLaws 1998, LB 924, § 65;R.S.1943, (1999), § 86-1603;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 499;Laws 2024, LB102, § 12.",
