In the alternative, the developer may obtain the agreement of the lienholder to take the project, in the event of default by the developer, subject to the rights of the nondefaulting purchasers by (1) posting a bond, equal to fifty percent of the amount owed to the lienholder, (2) making an assignment of receivables equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the principal amounts due from purchasers, (3) pledging collateral security equal to one hundred percent of the amount owed to the lienholder, or (4) entering into any other financing plan or escrow agreement acceptable to the lienholder.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 945, § 40.",
