Said plans shall show graphically all particulars of any building including, but not limited to, the dimensions, area and location of each apartment therein and the dimensions, area and location of common elements affording access to each apartment. Other common elements, both limited and general, shall be shown graphically insofar as possible and shall be described in detail in words and figures.
