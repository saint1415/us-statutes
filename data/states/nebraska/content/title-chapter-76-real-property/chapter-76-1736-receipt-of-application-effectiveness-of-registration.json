Such notification shall serve to suspend the effective date of the filing until the sixtieth day after the developer files such additional information as the commission shall require. If the developer fails to provide additional information as required by the commission within ninety days after receiving notice, the commission may deny the application or amendment. Any developer, upon receipt of such notice of suspension may request a hearing, and such hearing shall be held within forty-five days after receipt of such request.\n\n(3) If an application or amendment is denied by the commission, the developer shall submit a new application for registration or amendment and any filing fees pursuant to section 76-1734.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 945, § 36;Laws 2001, LB 68, § 17.",
