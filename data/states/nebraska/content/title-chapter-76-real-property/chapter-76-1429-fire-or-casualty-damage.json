Accounting for rent in the event of termination or apportionment is to occur as of the date of the casualty. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the tenant is responsible for damage caused by his negligence.SourceLaws 1974, LB 293, § 29.AnnotationsThe Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act expressly upholds tenants’ liability for negligent fire damage.
