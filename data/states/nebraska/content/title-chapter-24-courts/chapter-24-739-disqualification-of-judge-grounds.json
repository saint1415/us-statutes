When an attorney in a case (filing and signing the information used to charge the defendant) is the judge's spouse, the judge is disqualified and may not sit on the case, whether that judge had knowledge of the spouse's involvement or not.

Effect of refusal to disqualify\n\nIn an equity suit, the trial judge's refusal to disqualify himself is immaterial on appeal since the reviewing court examines the record and tries the case de novo. Deacon v. Deacon, 207 Neb. 193, 297 N.W.2d 757 (1980).\n\nIn equity suit, denial by district court of disqualification is immaterial on appeal since case is tried de novo in reviewing court.
