The State Court Administrator shall ensure that each judicial district has at least one of such courts by January 1, 2024.\n\n(6) The State Court Administrator shall track and evaluate outcomes of problem solving courts. On or before June 1, 2024, and on or before each June 1 thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a report to the Legislature regarding the impact of problem solving courts on recidivism rates in the state. The report shall also include rates of return to court and program completion. The report shall identify judicial districts that are underserved by problem solving courts and what services or funding are needed to properly serve such districts.\n\nSourceLaws 2004, LB 454, § 2;Laws 2008, LB1014, § 7;Laws 2016, LB919, § 2;Laws 2023, LB50, § 1.",
