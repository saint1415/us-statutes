General Powers\n\nAs a court of general jurisdiction, district court has power to examine into and determine the sufficiency of supersedeas and appeal bonds and the sureties thereon up to the time when appeal to the Supreme Court is complete. Fisher v. Keeler, 142 Neb. 79, 5 N.W.2d 143 (1942).\n\nCourt has power to punish for contempt. Back v. State, 75 Neb. 603, 106 N.W. 787 (1906).\n\nDistrict court has power to send original process to any part of state unless restricted. Eager v. Eager, 74 Neb. 827, 105 N.W. 636 (1905), reversed on rehearing, 74 Neb. 830, 107 N.W. 254 (1906).\n\nCourt has power in equity to supply omissions in legal procedure. Wardell v. Wardell, 71 Neb. 774, 99 N.W. 674 (1904).\n\nDistrict court may, in its discretion, sit as an examining magistrate. State v.

In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888).\n\n2. Jurisdiction\n\nA district court's jurisdiction over a 42 U.S.C. 1983 claim flows from the Legislature's grant of general jurisdiction to that court, over and above the district court's jurisdiction conferred by the Nebraska Constitution. Webb v. Nebraska Dept. of Health & Human Servs., 301 Neb. 810, 920 N.W.2d 268 (2018).\n\nIn a court of general jurisdiction, jurisdiction may be presumed absent a record showing the contrary. Webb v. Nebraska Dept. of Health & Human Servs., 301 Neb. 810, 920 N.W.2d 268 (2018).\n\nSection 30-810 provides special procedures for settling wrongful death claims, but it is silent on wrongful death actions and subrogation. Accordingly, under section 48-118.01, wrongful death actions and, under section 48-118.04, proceedings for the fair and equitable distribution of wrongful death action proceeds subject to subrogation in workers' compensation cases must be brought in the district court. In re Estate of Evertson, 295 Neb. 301, 889 N.W.2d 73 (2016).\n\nSection 48-161 provides the Workers' Compensation Court with jurisdiction to determine insurance disputes in workers' compensation claims, including the existence of coverage and the extent of an insurer's liability. According to the terms of section 48-161, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, however, and the district court may also exercise its inherent jurisdiction for these purposes. Schweitzer v. American Nat. Red Cross, 256 Neb. 350, 591 N.W.2d 524 (1999).\n\nUnless upon change of venue, an accused cannot be tried lawfully in any county other than the county where the offense was committed. State v. Furstenau, 167 Neb. 439, 93 N.W.2d 384 (1958).\n\nDistrict courts have general and original jurisdiction in criminal cases except when otherwise provided. Lingo v. Hann, 161 Neb. 67, 71 N.W.2d 716 (1955).\n\nLegislature cannot take from courts the broad general jurisdiction conferred on them by the Constitution of Nebraska. State ex re. Wright v. Barney, 133 Neb. 676, 276 N.W. 676 (1937).\n\nCourts have no discretion to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of cause of action brought by nonresident because of such nonresidence. Herrmann v. Franklin Ice Cream Co., 114 Neb. 468, 208 N.W. 141 (1926).\n\nCourt has general equity jurisdiction. Rhoades v. Rhoades, 78 Neb. 495, 111 N.W. 122 (1907).\n\nCourt has jurisdiction to assign dower. Swobe v. Marsh, 73 Neb. 331, 102 N.W. 619 (1905).\n\nIf the court has no jurisdiction, judgment is void. Aldrich v. Steen, 71 Neb. 33, 98 N.W. 445 (1904), affirmed on rehearing, 71 Neb. 57, 100 N.W. 311 (1904).\n\nDistrict court does not have original jurisdiction of will contest, or to construe same where there is no trust. Andersen v. Andersen, 69 Neb. 565, 96 N.W. 276 (1903).\n\nParties cannot confer jurisdiction over subject matter. Crawford Co. v. Hathaway, 61 Neb. 317, 85 N.W. 303 (1901).\n\nCourt has jurisdiction of action for alimony independent of divorce action. Earle v. Earle, 27 Neb. 277, 43 N.W. 118 (1889).\n\nCourt has jurisdiction to set aside deed fraudulently secured. Barker v. Barker, 27 Neb. 135, 42 N.W. 889 (1889).\n\nCourt has general jurisdiction to compel executor to account for trust funds. Blake v. Chambers, 4 Neb. 90 (1875).\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\nVoid judgment may be collaterally attacked. Radil v. Sawyer, 85 Neb. 235, 122 N.W. 980 (1909).\n\nRegularity of proceedings will be presumed. Back v. State, 75 Neb. 603, 106 N.W. 787 (1906); Wright v. State, 45 Neb. 44, 63 N.W. 147 (1895).\n\nEven though a court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a request for a domestic abuse protection order, the defendant may file to transfer the action to a more appropriate venue pursuant to section 25-403.01. Jacobo v. Zoltenko, 30 Neb. App. 44, 965 N.W.2d 32 (2021).",
