The director may designate a county road as part of the state highway system over which the department shall have responsibility, as soon as such road is deemed a temporary detour for the state highway system.\n\nIf such county road remains a detour road for the state highway system one year after it was initially designated a detour road, the Director-State Engineer shall consider the factors in section 39-1309 to determine whether such road shall continue as part of the state highway system. Upon a determination by the director that such road shall no longer be part of the state highway system, the director shall provide notice of such fact to the county board or the county's governing body having primary authority for such road.\n\nSourceLaws 1981, LB 285, § 4.",
