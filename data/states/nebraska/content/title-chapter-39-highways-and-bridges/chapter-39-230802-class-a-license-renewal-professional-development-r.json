If the board determines that good cause was not shown or if the license holder requests renewal as a Class B licensee, the board shall issue a Class B license. Renewal of such Class B license shall be governed by section 39-2308.\n\n(3) A holder of a Class B license who previously held a Class A license may be reissued a Class A license by:\n\n(a) Electing to either:\n\n(i) Complete one and one-half of the triennial requirements for professional development as set forth in the rules and regulations of the board; or\n\n(ii) Reapply under section 39-2308.01; and\n\n(b) Paying the seventy-five-dollar Class A application fee.\n\nSourceLaws 2003, LB 500, § 10.",
