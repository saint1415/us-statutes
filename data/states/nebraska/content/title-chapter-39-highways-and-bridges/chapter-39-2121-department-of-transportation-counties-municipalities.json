Such funds shall be held in escrow for six months until the county or municipality complies. If the county or municipality complies within the six-month period it shall receive the money in escrow, but after six months, if the county or municipality fails to comply, the money in the escrow account shall be lost to the county or municipality and shall be distributed to other counties or municipalities, as appropriate, in the manner provided by law for allocation of highway-user revenue.\n\n(3) If any county or municipality either (a) files a materially false certification form or (b) constructs any highway, road, or street below the minimum standards developed under section 39-2113, without having received prior approval thereof, such county's or municipality's share of highway-user revenue allocated during the following calendar year shall be reduced by ten percent and the amount of any such reduction shall be distributed among the other counties or municipalities, as appropriate, in the manner provided by law for allocation of highway-user revenue. The penalty for filing a materially false certification form and the penalty for constructing a highway, road, or street below established minimum standards without prior approval shall be assessed by the board only after a review of the facts involved in such case and the holding of a public hearing on the matter. The decision thereafter rendered by the board may be appealed, and the appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 312, § 21, p. 1127;Laws 1971, LB 100, § 10;Laws 1973, LB 137, § 3;Laws 1976, LB 724, § 6;Laws 1988, LB 352, § 33;Laws 2017, LB339, § 157;Laws 2019, LB82, § 11.\n\nCross ReferencesAdministrative Procedure Act, see section 84-920.",
