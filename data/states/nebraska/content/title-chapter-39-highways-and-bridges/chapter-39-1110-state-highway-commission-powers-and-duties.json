The commission shall submit to the Governor, within two weeks after such hearing, its written advice upon such proposed relinquishment or abandonment.\n\n(2) All funds rendered available by law to the department, including funds already collected for such purposes, may be used by the State Highway Commission in administering and effecting such purposes, to be paid upon approval by the Director-State Engineer.\n\n(3) All data and information of the department shall be available to the State Highway Commission.\n\n(4) The State Highway Commission may issue bonds under the Nebraska Highway Bond Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1953, c. 334, § 10, p. 1098;Laws 1955, c. 163, § 3, p. 469;Laws 2000, LB 1135, § 4;Laws 2017, LB339, § 120.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Highway Bond Act, see section 39-2222.",
