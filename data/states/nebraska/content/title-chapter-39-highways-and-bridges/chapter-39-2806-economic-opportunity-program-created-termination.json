The Department of Transportation shall develop the program, including the application process, criteria for providing funding, matching requirements, and provisions for recapturing funds awarded for projects with unmet obligations, in consultation with statewide associations representing municipal and county officials, economic developers, and the Department of Economic Development. No project shall be approved through the Economic Opportunity Program without an economic impact analysis proving positive economic impact. The Economic Opportunity Program terminates June 30, 2025, with all projects with approved applications or approved letters of interest as of May 1, 2025, authorized for continued funding from the program until expended or no longer needed.
