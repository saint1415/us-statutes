If such road lies within a township in a county operating roads on a township basis, the road shall not be vacated or abandoned unless an offer has been made to relinquish to the township in the manner provided in section 39-1726.\n\n(3) In the event that the county board decides to vacate or abandon a public road, its resolution shall state upon what conditions, if any, the vacation or abandonment shall be qualified and particularly whether or not the title or right-of-way to any vacated or abandoned fragment or section of road shall be sold, revert to private ownership, or remain in the public. If the county board fails to specify in a resolution as to the disposition of right-of-way, and if there shall be nonuse of such right-of-way for any public purpose for a continuous period of not less than ten years, the right-of-way shall revert to the owners of the adjacent real estate, one-half on each side of such road.\n\n(4) When the county vacates all or any portion of a road, the county shall, within thirty days after the effective date of the vacation, file a certified copy of the vacating resolution with the register of deeds for the county to be indexed against all affected lots.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 155, art.
