If such boards for any reason shall fail to agree with reference to such matter, it shall be the duty of the drainage or irrigation district to build the necessary bridges and approaches, and restore the highway in question to its former state as nearly as may be as it was laid out prior to the construction of the ditch or channel in question, and it shall be the duty of the county or municipal corporation involved to maintain the bridges and approaches. Where more than seventy-five percent of the water passing through any such ditch or channel is used by any person, firm, or corporation for purposes other than irrigation or drainage, it shall be the duty of such person, firm, or corporation, so using such seventy-five percent or more of such water, to build and maintain solely at the expense of such person, firm, or corporation, all such bridges and approaches thereto. Any bridge that may be built by any drainage or irrigation district or by any person, firm, or corporation under the provisions of this section shall be constructed under the supervision of the Department of Transportation, if on a state highway, and under the supervision of the county board or governing body of a municipality, if under the jurisdiction of such board or governing body of such municipality.\n\nSourceLaws 1913, c. 172, § 1, p. 524;R.S.1913, § 2983;C.S.1922, § 2734;Laws 1929, c. 172, § 1, p. 586;C.S.1929, § 39-821;R.S.1943, § 39-805;Laws 2017, LB339, § 110.\n\nCross ReferencesIrrigation ditches, bridges across, see sections 46-251 and 46-255.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThis section is in conflict with common law and must be strictly construed.
