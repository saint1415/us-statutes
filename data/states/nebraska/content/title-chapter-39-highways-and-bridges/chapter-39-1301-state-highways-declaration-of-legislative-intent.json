It is the intent of the Legislature to grant authority to the Director-State Engineer to exercise sufficient power and authority to enable him or her and the department to carry out the broad objectives stated in this section.\n\n(9) While it is necessary to fix responsibilities for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the several systems of highways, it is intended that the State of Nebraska shall have an integrated system of all roads and streets to provide safe and efficient highway transportation throughout the state. The authority granted in sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 to the Director-State Engineer and to the political or governmental subdivisions or public corporations of this state to assist and cooperate with each other is therefor essential.\n\n(10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 are necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, for promotion of the general welfare, and as a contribution to the national defense.\n\nSourceLaws 1955, c. 148, § 1, p. 414;Laws 1993, LB 15, § 3;Laws 2016, LB1038, § 7;Laws 2017, LB271, § 3;Laws 2025, LB36, § 28.Effective Date: September 3, 2025\n\nAnnotations\n\nThis section declares the policy of the state with respect to state highways.
