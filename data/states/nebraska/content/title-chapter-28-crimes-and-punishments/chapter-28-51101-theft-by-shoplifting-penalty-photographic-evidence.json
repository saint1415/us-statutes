Sexton, 240 Neb. 466, 482 N.W.2d 567 (1992).\n\nWhere a defendant was convicted by a jury of shoplifting merchandise valued at $787 and the only evidence of value was the price at which the merchandise was offered for sale, such evidence was insufficient to prove value. State v. Ybarra, 9 Neb. App. 230, 609 N.W.2d 696 (2000).",
