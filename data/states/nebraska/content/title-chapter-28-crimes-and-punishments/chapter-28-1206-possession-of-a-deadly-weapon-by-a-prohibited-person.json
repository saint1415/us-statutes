Felon in possession\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Felon in possession\n\nSufficient circumstantial evidence supported the defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person where a witness heard a gunshot, saw the defendant with an object in his hands, and heard the defendant scream something like \"next time I won't miss\" and law enforcement located a spent shell casing near where the witness saw the defendant standing. State v. Dap, 315 Neb. 466, 997 N.W.2d 363 (2023).\n\nIn the sufficiency of evidence context, the State is not required to prove that a defendant charged with violating this section had or waived counsel at the time of a prior conviction as an essential element of the crime. State v. Vann, 306 Neb. 91, 944 N.W.2d 503 (2020).\n\nTo prove that a defendant has a prior felony conviction in a felon in possession case, convictions obtained after Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963), are entitled to a presumption of regularity such that records of conviction are admissible, unless the defendant can show that he or she did not have or waive counsel at the time of conviction. State v. Vann, 306 Neb. 91, 944 N.W.2d 503 (2020).\n\nBefore a prior felony conviction can be used to prove that a defendant is a felon in a felon in possession case, the State must prove either that the prior felony conviction was counseled or that counsel was waived. State v. Watt, 285 Neb. 647, 832 N.W.2d 459 (2013).\n\nUse of a prior conviction to establish status as a felon and then enhance a sentence does not constitute impermissible double enhancement. State v. Ramirez, 274 Neb. 873, 745 N.W.2d 214 (2008).\n\nPossession of a knife by a convicted felon is not unlawful under the plain language of this section. State v. Gozzola, 273 Neb. 309, 729 N.W.2d 87 (2007).\n\nNebraska law explicitly and unequivocally prohibits a felon from being in possession of a firearm. State v. Mowell, 267 Neb. 83, 672 N.W.2d 389 (2003).\n\nThis section punishes the specific conduct of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony, not the underlying felony. State v. Peters, 261 Neb. 416, 622 N.W.2d 918 (2001).\n\nIn order to use a prior conviction as proof that a defendant has been convicted of a felony for purposes of the felon in possession statute, the State must establish that at the time of the prior conviction, the defendant had or waived counsel. State v. Portsche, 258 Neb. 926, 606 N.W.2d 794 (2000).\n\nThe release of a convicted felon from probation and the restoration of his or her civil rights does not nullify the conviction under the terms of subsection (1) of this section. State v. Illig, 237 Neb. 598, 467 N.W.2d 375 (1991).\n\nPursuant to subsection (1) of this section, a convicted felon may not possess a firearm for purposes of self-defense. State v. Harrington, 236 Neb. 500, 461 N.W.2d 752 (1990).\n\nPossession of a firearm by a felon on two separate days, absent any evidence of an interruption in that possession, is a single continuing offense where the statute does not specify any means for dividing an uninterrupted possession into separate offenses, and the former instance of possession is included in the offense for the latter. State v. Williams, 211 Neb. 650, 319 N.W.2d 748 (1982).\n\nStatute prohibiting felon from possessing a firearm includes purchase and possession of antique firearm. State v. Tharp, 22 Neb. App. 454, 854 N.W.2d 651 (2014).\n\nTo have \"previously been convicted of a felony\", as the phrase is used in subsection (1) of this section, a defendant need not have commenced serving his or her sentence for the previous conviction. State v. Moore, 3 Neb. App. 417, 527 N.W.2d 223 (1995).\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\nSubsection (1) of this section is not unconstitutionally overbroad. State v. Green, 287 Neb. 212, 842 N.W.2d 74 (2014).\n\nProsecution for both unlawful discharge of a firearm under section 28-1212.02 and possession of a deadly weapon by a felon under this section does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. State v. McBride, 252 Neb. 866, 567 N.W.2d 136 (1997).\n\nA pistol is a firearm. State v. Melton, 239 Neb. 790, 478 N.W.2d 341 (1992).\n\nThis section is held not to be invalid as in conflict with Neb. Const. art. I, section 1. State v. Comeau, 233 Neb. 907, 448 N.W.2d 595 (1989).\n\nEvidence which was seized during a search based solely on an illegal wiretap must be suppressed and a conviction based on that evidence reversed, where it was agreed that the defendant had waived his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but had not waived his rights under section 86-701 et seq. (recodified in 2002 as section 86-271 et seq.). State v. Aulrich, 209 Neb. 546, 308 N.W.2d 739 (1981).\n\nPursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the doctrine of constructive possession applies to the possession of a firearm by a felon or a fugitive from justice, and the fact of possession may be proved by circumstantial evidence. State v. Long, 8 Neb. App. 353, 594 N.W.2d 310 (1999).",
