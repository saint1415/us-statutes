State v. Mather, 264 Neb. 182, 646 N.W.2d 605 (2002).\n\nThe sexual nature of a photograph is not determined solely from the subjects of the photograph, but from the motives of the persons generating the photograph. State v. Saulsbury, 243 Neb. 227, 498 N.W.2d 338 (1993).\n\nUnder previous statute, the act of appearing in an obscene film depicting children was prohibited. State v. Jensen, 226 Neb. 40, 409 N.W.2d 319 (1987).\n\nSubsection (1) of this section is neither overbroad nor vague under federal Constitution, but there is an open question of constitutionality under the Constitution of Nebraska. One may \"publish\" by showing a videotape; the phrase \"portrayed observer\" is not unconstitutionally overbroad; the phrase \"sexually explicit conduct\" is not unconstitutionally vague; and sexual excitement is not an element or substantial motivational factor of some of the conduct proscribed under subsection (1) of this section. State v. Burke, 225 Neb. 625, 408 N.W.2d 239 (1987).",
