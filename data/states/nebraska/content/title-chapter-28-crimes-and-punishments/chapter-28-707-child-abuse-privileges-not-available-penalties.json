Constitutionality\n\n2. Lesser-included offense\n\n3. Jury instructions\n\n4. Elements\n\n5. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Constitutionality\n\nMultiple convictions for second degree murder and child abuse resulting in death do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the state or federal Constitution. State v. Molina, 271 Neb. 488, 713 N.W.2d 412 (2006).\n\nSubsections (1)(a) and (c) of this section are not void for vagueness and are thus constitutional. State v. Crowdell, 234 Neb. 469, 451 N.W.2d 695 (1990).\n\n2. Lesser-included offense\n\nNegligent child abuse resulting in death is a lesser-included offense of intentional child abuse resulting in death. State v. Gonzalez, 313 Neb. 520, 985 N.W.2d 22 (2023).\n\nNegligent child abuse and intentional child abuse are lesser-included offenses of child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury and child abuse resulting in death. State v. Molina, 271 Neb. 488, 713 N.W.2d 412 (2006).\n\nMisdemeanor child abuse is a lesser-included offense of felony child abuse. State v. Parks, 253 Neb. 939, 573 N.W.2d 453 (1998).\n\nMisdemeanor child abuse is a lesser-included offense of felony child abuse. It is the defendant's state of mind which differentiates the offenses—if the abuse is committed knowingly and intentionally, it is a felony; if committed negligently, it is a misdemeanor. State v. Nguth, 13 Neb. App. 783, 701 N.W.2d 852 (2005).\n\n3. Jury instructions\n\nWhere a jury instruction properly reflects the State's alternative theories of guilt under different subsections of this section, a jury can convict the defendant if it finds the defendant committed any of the prohibited acts, and an appellate court will affirm the conviction if the evidence was sufficient to support any of the State's theories of guilt. State v. Knutson, 288 Neb. 823, 852 N.W.2d 307 (2014).\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is a lesser-included offense of child abuse resulting in death, and the jury should be so instructed if there is a rational basis upon which it could conclude that the defendant committed child abuse negligently, but not knowingly and intentionally. State v. Sinica, 277 Neb. 629, 764 N.W.2d 111 (2009).\n\nJury instruction given by trial court adequately distinguished the crimes of intentional child abuse and negligent child abuse. State v. Fitzgerald, 1 Neb. App. 315, 493 N.W.2d 357 (1992).\n\n4. Elements\n\nTo prove that child abuse results in the death of such child, the State must prove that the defendant proximately caused the child's death. State v. Matteson, 313 Neb. 435, 985 N.W.2d 1 (2023).\n\nTo convict a defendant of knowing and intentional child abuse resulting in death, the State must prove the defendant knowingly and intentionally caused or permitted the child to be abused in one or more of the ways defined in subsection (1) of this section, and also must prove the offense resulted in the child's death. It is not necessary to prove the defendant intended the abuse to result in the child's death. State v. Montoya, 304 Neb. 96, 933 N.W.2d 558 (2019).\n\nCriminal endangerment in subsection (1) of this section, providing that a \"person commits child abuse if he or she knowingly, intentionally, or negligently causes or permits a minor child to be . . . [p]laced in a situation that endangers his or her life or physical or mental health,\" encompasses not only conduct directed at the child, but also conduct that presents the likelihood of injury due to the child's having been placed in a situation caused by the defendant's conduct. State v. Ferguson, 301 Neb. 697, 919 N.W.2d 863 (2018).\n\nCriminal endangerment in subsection (1)(a) of this section encompasses not only conduct directed at the child but also conduct which presents the likelihood of injury due to the child's having been placed in a situation caused by the defendant's conduct. State v. Mendez-Osorio, 297 Neb. 520, 900 N.W.2d 776 (2017).\n\nThe State is not required to prove a minor child was in the exclusive care or custody of the defendant when the child abuse occurred. State v. Olbricht, 294 Neb. 974, 885 N.W.2d 699 (2016).\n\nEvidence must be sufficient for the factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful conduct resulted in death. State v. Muro, 269 Neb. 703, 695 N.W.2d 425 (2005).\n\n\"Endangers\" as used in subsection (1)(a) of this section means to expose a minor child's life or health to danger or the peril of probable harm or loss. State v. Crowdell, 234 Neb. 469, 451 N.W.2d 695 (1990).\n\nThe term cruelly punished as used in this statute has acquired a relatively widely accepted connotation in the law and is capable of an easily understood meaning. State v. Sinica, 220 Neb. 792, 372 N.W.2d 445 (1985).\n\nThis section applies to persons who either \"cause\" or \"permit\" a minor child to be placed in a situation to be sexually abused. By its very nature, this section governs both action and inaction. No overt act is required when one permits a child to be placed in a situation to be sexually abused; rather, one can permit it to happen by failing to take action to prevent it. State v. Fernando, 32 Neb. App. 289, 996 N.W.2d 630 (2023).\n\nThis section only requires proof of the status of the victim as a minor child; it does not require proof of the victim's actual identity or birth date. State v. Thomas, 25 Neb. App. 256, 904 N.W.2d 295 (2017).\n\n5. Miscellaneous\n\nThe subsection of this section criminalizing child abuse that results in the death of such child is not unconstitutionally vague. State v. Matteson, 313 Neb. 435, 985 N.W.2d 1 (2023).\n\nThis section contains multiple gradations of felony child abuse, depending upon the result of the abusive conduct. State v. Muro, 269 Neb. 703, 695 N.W.2d 425 (2005).\n\nUnder subsection (2) of this section, the statutory privilege between patient and professional counselor is not available in a prosecution for child abuse. State v. McMillion, 23 Neb. App. 687, 875 N.W.2d 877 (2016).\n\nA general finding of guilt under this section would not be a finding of felony assault because it is possible to commit the crime of child abuse by means other than by felony assault. In re Interest of Janet J., 12 Neb. App. 42, 666 N.W.2d 741 (2003).",
