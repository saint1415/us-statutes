State v. Benson, 305 Neb. 949, 943 N.W.2d 426 (2020).\n\nEvidence was sufficient to support a conviction for tampering with a witness, where after the victim reported that she was sexually assaulted, the defendant relayed a message asking the victim to drop the charges; by doing so, the defendant essentially asked the victim to inform falsely or to withhold information. State v. Guzman, 305 Neb. 376, 940 N.W.2d 552 (2020).\n\nSufficient evidence was presented from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to persuade the victim, who is also the witness, to withhold any further information concerning the rape she had reported.
