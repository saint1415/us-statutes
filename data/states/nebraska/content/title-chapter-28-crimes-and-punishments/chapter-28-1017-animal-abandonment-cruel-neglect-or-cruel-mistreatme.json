When an immediate response is necessary to protect the health and safety of the animal or others, the report of an employee shall be made by telephone as soon as possible.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose a duty to investigate observed or reasonably suspected animal abandonment, cruel neglect, or cruel mistreatment. Any person making a report under this section is immune from liability except for false statements of fact made with malicious intent.\n\n(5) A report made by an employee pursuant to this section shall include:\n\n(a) The reporter's name and title, business address, and telephone number;\n\n(b) The name, if known, of the animal owner or custodian, whether a business or individual;\n\n(c) A description of the animal or animals involved, person or persons involved, and location of the animal or animals and the premises; and\n\n(d) The date, time, and a description of the observation or incident which led the reporter to reasonably suspect animal abandonment, cruel neglect, or cruel mistreatment and any other information the reporter believes may be relevant.\n\n(6) A report made by an employee pursuant to this section may be made on preprinted forms prepared by the entity or entities that investigate reports of animal abandonment, cruel neglect, or cruel mistreatment in that jurisdiction. The form shall include space for the information required under subsection (5) of this section.\n\n(7) When two or more employees jointly have observed or reasonably suspected animal abandonment, cruel neglect, or cruel mistreatment and there is agreement between or among them, a report may be made by one person by mutual agreement. Any such reporter who has knowledge that the person designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter make the report.\n\n(8) Any employee failing to report under this section shall be guilty of an infraction.\n\nSourceLaws 2003, LB 273, § 1;Laws 2009, LB494, § 6.",
