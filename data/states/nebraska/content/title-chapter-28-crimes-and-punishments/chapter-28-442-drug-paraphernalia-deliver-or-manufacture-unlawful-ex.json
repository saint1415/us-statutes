Casbah, Inc. v. Thone, 651 F.2d 551 (8th Cir. 1981).\n\nWhere statute includes requirement of intent in definition of drug paraphernalia and enumerates factors which officer has to consider in determining whether object is drug paraphernalia, statute does not alter requirement that searches and seizures be based on probable cause and is thus not violative of Fourth Amendment. Casbah, Inc. v. Thone, 651 F.2d 551 (8th Cir. 1981).",
