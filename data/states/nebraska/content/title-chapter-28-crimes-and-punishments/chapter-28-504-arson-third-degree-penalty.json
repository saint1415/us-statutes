Such property shall not be contained within a building and shall not be a building or occupied structure.(2) Arson in the third degree is a Class IV felony if the damages amount to one thousand five hundred dollars or more.(3) Arson in the third degree is a Class I misdemeanor if the damages are five hundred dollars or more but less than one thousand five hundred dollars.(4) Arson in the third degree is a Class II misdemeanor if the damages are less than five hundred dollars.SourceLaws 1977, LB 38, § 103;Laws 2010, LB712, § 10;Laws 2015, LB605, § 27.AnnotationsUnder this section, the amount of damages involved in the crime of third degree arson affects the severity of the punishment. Although the amount of damages is not an element of arson, the State must prove by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the amount of damages to the property that was damaged by arson in order to prove that the arson was a Class IV felony.
