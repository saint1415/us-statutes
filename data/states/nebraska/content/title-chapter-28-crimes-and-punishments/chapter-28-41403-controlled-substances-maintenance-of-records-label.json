Such label shall bear the name and address of the pharmacy or dispensing practitioner, the name of the patient, the date of filling, the serial number of the prescription under which it is recorded in the practitioner's prescription records, the name of the prescribing practitioner, and the directions for use of the controlled substance. Unless the prescribing practitioner writes \"do not label\" or words of similar import on the original paper prescription or so designates in an electronic prescription or an oral prescription, such label shall also bear the name of the controlled substance.\n\n(4) For multidrug containers, more than one drug, device, or biological may be dispensed in the same container when (a) such container is prepackaged by the manufacturer, packager, or distributor and shipped directly to the pharmacy in this manner or (b) the container does not accommodate greater than a thirty-one-day supply of compatible dosage units and is labeled to identify each drug or biological in the container in addition to all other information required by law.\n\n(5) If a pharmacy fills prescriptions for controlled substances on behalf of another pharmacy under contractual agreement or common ownership, the prescription label shall contain the Drug Enforcement Administration number of the pharmacy at which the prescriptions are filled.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB811, § 9;Laws 2017, LB166, § 5.",
