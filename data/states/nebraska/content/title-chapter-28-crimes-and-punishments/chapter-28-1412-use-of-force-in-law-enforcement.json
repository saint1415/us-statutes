Thompson, 244 Neb. 189, 505 N.W.2d 673 (1993).Pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, a police officer in making an arrest must use only reasonable force, which is that amount of force which an ordinary, prudent, and intelligent person with the knowledge and in the situation of the arresting officer would have deemed necessary under the circumstances. Wagner v. City of Omaha, 236 Neb. 843, 464 N.W.2d 175 (1991).Officer's use of force during arrest was justified and authorized. State v. Moore, 226 Neb. 347, 411 N.W.2d 345 (1987).The legislative policy in Nebraska is that force is not to be used in making an arrest unless the arrester believes such force is immediately necessary to effect a lawful arrest. State v. White, 209 Neb. 218, 306 N.W.2d 906 (1981).This section, which was section 28-839 under the old criminal code, does apply to police officers, notwithstanding the fact that this section refers only to \"actors\" and that the statutory definition of \"actor\" excludes law enforcement officers. Landrum v. Moats, 576 F.2d 1320 (8th Cir. 1978).Where a police officer who pursued and fatally shot a burglary suspect whom he did not believe was involved in a crime involving the use or threatened use of deadly force and who did not present a substantial risk that he would cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension were delayed, the police officer used unreasonable force as a matter of law in firing at the suspect as he fled.
