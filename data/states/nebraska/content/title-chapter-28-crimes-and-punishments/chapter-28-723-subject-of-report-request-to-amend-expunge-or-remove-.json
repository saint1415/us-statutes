If the department refuses to do so or does not act within thirty days, the subject of the report of child abuse or neglect shall have the right to a fair hearing within the department to determine whether the record of the report of child abuse or neglect should be amended, expunged, or removed on the grounds that it is inaccurate or that it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with the Child Protection and Family Safety Act. Such fair hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the subject's request and at a reasonable place and hour. In such hearings, the burden of proving the accuracy and consistency of the record shall be on the department. A juvenile court finding of child abuse or child neglect shall be presumptive evidence that the report was not unfounded. The hearing shall be conducted by the chief executive officer of the department or his or her designated agent, who is hereby authorized and empowered to order the amendment, expunction, or removal of the record to make it accurate or consistent with the requirements of the act. The decision shall be made in writing, at the close of the hearing or within thirty days thereof, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based. Decisions of the department may be appealed under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1979, LB 505, § 11;Laws 1982, LB 522, § 6;Laws 2005, LB 116, § 15;Laws 2014, LB853, § 13.\n\nCross ReferencesAdministrative Procedure Act, see section 84-920.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services Regulation and Licensure must prove the accuracy and consistency of a central registry report of child abuse or neglect by a preponderance of the evidence in a hearing to expunge, amend, or remove a report under this section.
