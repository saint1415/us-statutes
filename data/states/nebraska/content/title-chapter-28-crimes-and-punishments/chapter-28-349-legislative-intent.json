Often such persons cannot find others able or willing to render assistance. The Legislature intends through the Adult Protective Services Act to establish a program designed to fill this need and to assure the availability of the program to all eligible persons. It is also the intent of the Legislature to authorize the least restriction possible on the exercise of personal and civil rights consistent with the person's need for services.\n\nSourceLaws 1988, LB 463, § 2;Laws 2012, LB1051, § 2.\n\nAnnotations\n\nA public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine applies to allow a cause of action for retaliatory discharge when an employee is fired for making a report of abuse as mandated by the Adult Protective Services Act.
