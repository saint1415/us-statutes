      "text": "28-387.Short-term protective services; temporary placement; authorized; when; procedure.\n\n(1) A county court may issue an ex parte order authorizing the provision of short-term involuntary adult protective services or temporary placement for a vulnerable adult for up to forty-eight hours, excluding nonjudicial days, pending the hearing for a need for continuing services, after finding on the record that:\n\n(a) The person is a vulnerable adult;\n\n(b) An emergency exists; and\n\n(c) There are compelling reasons for ordering protective services or temporary placement.\n\n(2) An ex parte order shall be issued only if other protective custody services are unavailable or other services provide insufficient protection.\n\n(3) The department shall contact the appropriate county attorney to file an application for short-term involuntary adult protective services or temporary placement if an investigation indicates probable cause to believe that an emergency exists for a vulnerable adult. The department shall not be given legal custody nor be made guardian of such vulnerable adult. A vulnerable adult shall be responsible for the costs of services provided either through his or her own income or other programs for which he or she may be eligible.\n\n(4) A law enforcement officer accompanied by a representative of the department may enter the premises where the vulnerable adult is located after obtaining the court order and announcing his or her authority and purpose. Forcible entry may be made only after the court order has been obtained unless there is probable cause to believe that the delay of such entry would cause the vulnerable adult to be in imminent danger of life-threatening physical injury or neglect.\n\n(5) When, from the personal observations of a representative of the department and a law enforcement officer, it appears probable that the vulnerable adult is likely to be in imminent danger of life-threatening physical injury or neglect if he or she is not immediately removed from the premises, the law enforcement agency shall, when authorized by the court order, take into custody and transport the vulnerable adult to an appropriate medical or protective placement facility.\n\n(6) When action is taken under this section, a hearing shall be held within forty-eight hours of the signing of the court order, excluding nonjudicial days, to establish probable cause for short-term involuntary adult protective services or for protective placement. Unless the vulnerable adult has counsel of his or her own choice or has indicated a desire for an attorney of his or her own choice, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent him or her in the proceeding, who shall have the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.\n\n(7) Notice of the hearing shall be served personally on the vulnerable adult. Waiver of notice by the vulnerable adult shall not be effective unless he or she attends the hearing or such notice is waived by the guardian ad litem. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the following parties whose whereabouts can be readily ascertained: (a) The spouse of the vulnerable adult; (b) children of the vulnerable adult; and (c) any other party specified by the court.\n\n(8) A judgment authorizing continuance of short-term involuntary adult protective services shall prescribe those specific adult protective services which are to be provided, the duration of the services which shall not exceed sixty days, and the person or persons who are authorized or ordered to provide them.\n\nSourceLaws 1988, LB 463, § 40;Laws 2012, LB1051, § 16.",
