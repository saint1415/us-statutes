A licensed obstetrician or family practitioner who regularly assists pregnant women in resolving medical matters related to pregnancy may be qualified to testify as an expert on the screening, counseling, management, and treatment of pregnancies;\n\n(4) Any physician advertising services in this state shall be deemed to be transacting business in this state pursuant to section 25-536 and shall be subject to the provisions of section 28-327;\n\n(5) It shall be an affirmative defense to an allegation of inadequate disclosure under the requirements of section 28-327 that the defendant omitted the contested information because statistically validated surveys of the general population of women of reproductive age, conducted within the three years before or after the contested abortion, demonstrate that less than five percent of women would consider the contested information to be relevant to an abortion decision; and\n\n(6) In addition to the other remedies available under the common or statutory law of this state, a woman or her survivors shall have a cause of action for reckless endangerment against any person, other than a physician or pharmacist licensed under the Uniform Credentialing Act, who attempts or completes an abortion on the pregnant woman or aids or abets the commission of a self-induced abortion.
