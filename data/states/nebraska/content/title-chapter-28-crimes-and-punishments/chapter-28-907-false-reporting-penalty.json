Elements2. Miscellaneous1. ElementsSubsection (1)(a) of this section includes other officials besides police officers who have the authority to investigate actual criminal matters. Nebraska Legislature on behalf of State v. Hergert, 271 Neb. 976, 720 N.W.2d 372 (2006).Subsection (1)(a) of this section prohibits a person from furnishing material information he or she knows to be false to any peace officer or other official with the intent to impede the investigation of an actual criminal matter. Nebraska Legislature on behalf of State v. Hergert, 271 Neb. 976, 720 N.W.2d 372 (2006).To commit the crime of false reporting one need not actually impede a police investigation, but must furnish false information with the intent to impede the investigation of a criminal matter. State v. Gonzales, 224 Neb. 659, 399 N.W.2d 832 (1987).\"To impede the investigation of an actual criminal matter\" includes the impeding of the gathering of information as to the identity of a defendant named in an arrest warrant. State v. Nissen, 224 Neb. 60, 395 N.W.2d 560 (1986).The phrase \"the investigation of an actual criminal matter\" requires that there be a legitimate and valid investigation of facts which could constitute a predicate criminal offense. State v. Ewing, 221 Neb. 462, 378 N.W.2d 158 (1985).The defendant's allegedly false statements to the 911 emergency dispatch service concerning crimes being committed at a certain address were made to a peace officer for purposes of the criminal statute prohibiting false reporting of a criminal matter; although the 911 emergency dispatch service was not a branch of law enforcement, it acted as an intermediary used by the general public to reach peace officers, and statements made to the emergency dispatch service were made with the intent to summon a law enforcement officer to that address. State v. Halligan, 20 Neb. App. 87, 818 N.W.2d 650 (2012).2. MiscellaneousThe purpose of subsection (1)(a) of this section is to prevent the public from willfully furnishing erroneous information to law enforcement officers and thus interfering with the performance of their duties. Interference with an officer's duties includes false statements that impede an officer's gathering of information. Nebraska Legislature on behalf of State v. Hergert, 271 Neb. 976, 720 N.W.2d 372 (2006).Evidence was sufficient for juvenile court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had violated provisions of this section. In re Interest of McManaman, 222 Neb. 263, 383 N.W.2d 45 (1986).Purpose of statute is to prevent wasted time and efforts of law enforcement personnel by discouraging public from willfully furnishing erroneous information to law enforcement officers which may interfere with performance of their duties. In re Interest of McManaman, 222 Neb. 263, 383 N.W.2d 45 (1986).A local ordinance which did not explicitly require that the false statement be material or be given with the intent to instigate or impede a criminal investigation is not inconsistent with this section where the ordinance does not restrict anything expressly permitted by this section and the provisions are able to coexist. In re Interest of Genevieve C., 13 Neb. App. 665, 698 N.W.2d 462 (2005).A person must have reliable knowledge of the principal's identity to be guilty as an accessory under section 28-204. Merely reporting false information about a crime without knowledge of the principal's identity constitutes the misdemeanor of false reporting, as defined by this section. State v. Anderson, 10 Neb. App. 163, 626 N.W.2d 627 (2001).",
