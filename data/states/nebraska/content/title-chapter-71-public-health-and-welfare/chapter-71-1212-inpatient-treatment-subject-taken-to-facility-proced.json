The administrator, over his or her signature, shall acknowledge the delivery on the original warrant which the sheriff shall return to the clerk of the district court with his or her costs and expenses endorsed thereon.

Such person shall take and subscribe an oath or affirmation to faithfully discharge his or her duty and shall be entitled to the same fees as the sheriff. The sheriff, deputy sheriff, or other person appointed by the mental health board may take with him or her such assistance as may be required to execute the warrant. No female subject shall be taken to a treatment facility without being accompanied by another female or relative of the subject. The administrator in his or her acknowledgment of delivery shall record whether any person accompanied the subject and the name of such person.\n\nSourceLaws 2006, LB 1199, § 68.",
