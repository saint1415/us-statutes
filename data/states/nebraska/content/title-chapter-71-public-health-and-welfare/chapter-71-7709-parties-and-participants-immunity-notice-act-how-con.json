The persons filing such notice shall also notify the department if negotiations have terminated, or if negotiations are continuing they shall notify the department of progress of negotiation at least once every six months. The department may request additional information from the potential parties and may communicate with and monitor the parties in any manner the department deems necessary but shall not hinder or interfere with negotiations.\n\n(5) The submission of a cooperative agreement for department approval pursuant to the act shall be voluntary, and the failure of the parties to any such agreement to seek approval shall not be admissible in any civil or criminal antitrust action if such action is based upon the cooperative agreement or arises from conduct or activity reasonably necessary and reasonably foreseeable to implement the cooperative agreement.\n\n(6) Nothing in the act shall be construed to limit the application of any other statute concerning the licensure of facilities, services, or professions, and any activities undertaken pursuant to a cooperative agreement shall comply with applicable law.\n\nSourceLaws 1994, LB 1223, § 119.",
