      "text": "71-4837.Rights and duties of procurement organization and others.\n\n(a) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donor Registry of Nebraska established pursuant to section 71-4822 and any donor registry that it knows exists for the geographical area in which the individual resides to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift.\n\n(b) A procurement organization must be allowed reasonable access to information in the records of the Donor Registry of Nebraska or any donor registry described in subsection (a) of this section to ascertain whether an individual at or near death is a donor.\n\n(c) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to determine the medical suitability of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research, or education from a donor or a prospective donor. During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows that the individual expressed a contrary intent. Measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part from a prospective donor may not be administered if it is determined that the administration of those measures would not provide the prospective donor with appropriate end-of-life care or it can be anticipated by reasonable medical judgment that such measures would cause the prospective donor's death other than by the prospective donor's underlying pathology.\n\n(d) Unless prohibited by law other than the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, at any time after a donor's death, the person to which a part passes under section 71-4834 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to determine the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.\n\n(e) Unless prohibited by law other than the act, an examination under subsection (c) or (d) of this section may include an examination of all medical and dental records of the donor or prospective donor.\n\n(f) Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless a procurement organization knows the minor is emancipated, the procurement organization shall conduct a reasonable search for the parents of the minor and provide the parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or revoke the refusal.\n\n(g) Upon referral by a hospital under subsection (a) of this section, a procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in section 71-4832 having priority to make or object to the making of an anatomical gift on behalf of a prospective donor. If a procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift to any other person was made, amended, or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person of all relevant information.\n\n(h) Subject to subsection (i) of section 71-4834 and sections 23-1825 to 23-1832, the rights of the person to which a part passes under section 71-4834 are superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. Subject to the terms of the document of gift and the act, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a part, the person to which the part passes under section 71-4834, upon the death of the donor and before embalming, burial, or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation.\n\n(i) Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of the decedent's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the decedent.\n\n(j) A physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a donor that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB1036, § 14.",
