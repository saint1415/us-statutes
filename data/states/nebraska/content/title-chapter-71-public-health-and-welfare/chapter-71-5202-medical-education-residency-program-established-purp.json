The dean and the departmental chairmen in the College of Medicine shall determine where residency education and training shall be established, giving consideration to communities in the state where the population, hospital facilities, number of physicians and interest in medical education indicate the potential success of residency education and training. The communities chosen shall be selected because they can be expected to fill requirements of the American Medical Association for participation in a residency program.\n\nSourceLaws 1975, LB 571, § 2.",
