For the purposes of this section, each six months of practice outside of this state of the practices or occupation for which application for a license is made shall be deemed the equivalent of one hundred hours of study and training required in this state in order to qualify for the practice of barbering.\n\nSourceLaws 1983, LB 87, § 5;Laws 1993, LB 226, § 14;Laws 1997, LB 752, § 167;Laws 2009, LB195, § 65.",
