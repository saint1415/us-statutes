The Legislature further finds that the injuries sustained by the infant or child can include brain swelling and damage, subdural hemorrhage, intellectual disability, or death. The Legislature further finds and declares that there is a present and growing need to provide programs aimed at reducing the number of cases of abusive head trauma in infants and children in Nebraska.\n\nSourceLaws 2006, LB 994, § 148;Laws 2013, LB23, § 33;Laws 2019, LB60, § 2.",
