If the hospital is unable to contact the caregiver, such lack of contact shall not interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care provided to the patient or the medically appropriate discharge or transfer of the patient. The hospital shall document all attempts to contact the caregiver in the patient's medical record.\n\nSourceLaws 2016, LB698, § 11.",
