If such person refuses to comply with such order, the state health officer or a local health officer shall institute proceedings for commitment, returnable to the county court of the county in which the person resides or, if the person is a nonresident or has no permanent residence, in the county in which the person is found. Strictness of pleading is not required, and a general allegation that the public health requires commitment of the person is sufficient.\n\n(2) When a person with communicable tuberculosis conducts himself or herself in such a way as to expose another person to the danger of infection, the state health officer or local health officer may order such person to submit to directed health measures necessary for the treatment of the person and to prevent the transmission of the disease. If such person refuses to comply with such order, the state health officer or a local health officer shall institute proceedings for commitment, returnable to the county court of the county in which the person resides or, if the person is a nonresident or has no permanent residence, in the county in which the person is found.
