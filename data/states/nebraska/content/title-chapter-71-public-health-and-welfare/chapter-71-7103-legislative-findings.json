Since the services of emergency service personnel affect the public health, safety, and welfare, the Legislature declares that a critical incident stress management program designed to reduce critical incident stress experienced by such personnel would be in the public interest and would assist such personnel with the demands which occur in their work.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 703, § 3;Laws 1997, LB 184, § 3.",
