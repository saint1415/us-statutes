If the question is submitted at a special election, three weeks' notice of such special election shall be given by publication in some newspaper of general circulation. Such notice shall be published three consecutive weeks if the election is in a city or village or, if in a village and no paper is published in such village, then the notice shall be posted in three of the most public places in the village. If a majority of the votes cast at such election on the question are in favor of the levy, then the regularly constituted authorities of the city, county, or village shall include the same in the estimate for expenses for each year during the period for which adopted, unless the same shall be revoked. The tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected. The levy shall be subject to section 77-3443.\n\nSourceLaws 1917, c. 209, § 2, p. 515;C.S.1922, § 8235;C.S.1929, § 71-2407;R.S.1943, § 71-1702;R.S.1943, (1986), § 71-1702;Laws 1987, LB 389, § 4;Laws 1996, LB 1114, § 65;Laws 1997, LB 269, § 33.\n\nAnnotations\n\nRegular election as used in this section has the same meaning as general election, and therefore a general November election is a competent time at which to submit to the voters the proposed tax levy.
