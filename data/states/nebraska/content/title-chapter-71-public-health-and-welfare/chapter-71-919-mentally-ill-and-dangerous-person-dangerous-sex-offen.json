The person in emergency protective custody shall remain at the medical facility until the medical or psychiatric emergency has passed and it is safe to transport such person, at which time the person shall be transferred to an available jail or Department of Correctional Services facility.\n\n(3)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (3)(b) of this section, upon admission to a facility or jail of a person taken into emergency protective custody by a law enforcement officer under this section, such officer shall execute a written certificate prescribed and provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.

A copy of such certificate shall be immediately forwarded to the county attorney.\n\n(b) In the case of a subject domiciled within Indian country who is taken into emergency protective custody by a law enforcement officer under tribal law, upon admission to a facility or jail, such officer shall execute written documentation in a format provided by the tribe. At a minimum, such documentation shall clearly identify the subject, identify the relevant tribe, allege the officer's belief that the person in custody is mentally ill and dangerous or a dangerous sex offender under tribal law, and contain a summary of the subject's behavior supporting such allegations. A copy of such documentation shall be immediately forwarded to the appropriate tribal prosecutor or tribal official.\n\n(4)(a) The administrator of the facility or jail shall have such person evaluated by a mental health professional as soon as reasonably possible but not later than thirty-six hours after admission. The mental health professional shall not be the mental health professional who causes such person to be taken into custody under this section and shall not be a member or alternate member of the mental health board that will preside over any hearing under the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act or the Sex Offender Commitment Act with respect to such person. Upon the agreement of all parties, the evaluation may be conducted by videoconferencing if the mental health professional thinks it appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(b) A person shall be released from emergency protective custody after completion of such evaluation unless the mental health professional determines, in his or her clinical opinion, that such person is mentally ill and dangerous or a dangerous sex offender. In the case of a subject domiciled within Indian country who is taken into emergency protective custody under tribal law, the mental health professional shall notify an appropriate tribal prosecutor or official of such release.\n\nSourceLaws 1976, LB 806, § 30;Laws 1978, LB 501, § 2;Laws 1988, LB 257, § 2;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 964;Laws 1996, LB 1155, § 95;R.S.1943, (1999), § 83-1020;Laws 2004, LB 1083, § 39;Laws 2006, LB 1199, § 38;Laws 2007, LB296, § 462;Laws 2024, LB1288, § 14;Laws 2025, LB150, § 109.Operative Date: September 3, 2025\n\nCross ReferencesRegional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act, see section 47-1201.Sex Offender Commitment Act, see section 71-1201.",
