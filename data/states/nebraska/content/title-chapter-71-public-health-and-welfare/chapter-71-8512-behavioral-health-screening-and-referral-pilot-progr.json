      "text": "71-8512.Behavioral Health Screening and Referral Pilot Program; created by University of Nebraska Medical Center; clinics; selection; collection of data; evaluation; termination of section.\n\n(1) The University of Nebraska Medical Center shall create the Behavioral Health Screening and Referral Pilot Program. The pilot program shall utilize a strategy of screening and behavioral health intervention in coordination with the regional behavioral health authorities established pursuant to section 71-808 in which the clinics identified under subsection (2) of this section are located. It is the intent of the Legislature that the pilot program demonstrate a method of addressing the unmet emotional or behavioral health needs of children that can be replicated statewide. Under the pilot program, behavioral health screening will be offered: (a) In primary care providers' offices during examinations under the early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment services program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(r), as such section existed on January 1, 2013; or (b) upon request from parents or legal guardians who have concerns about a child's behavioral health.\n\n(2) Three clinics shall be selected to serve as sites for the pilot program, including at least one rural and one urban clinic. Selected clinics shall have child psychologists integrated in the pediatric practice of the clinics. Parents or legal guardians of children participating in the pilot program shall be offered routine mental and behavioral health screening for their child during required physical examinations or at the request of a parent or legal guardian. Behavioral health screening shall be administered by clinic staff and interpreted by the psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, psychologist, or licensed mental health practitioner and the child's primary care physician.\n\n(3) Children identified through such screenings as being at risk may be referred for further evaluation and diagnosis as indicated. If intervention is required, the primary care medical team, including the psychologist and the primary care physician, shall develop a treatment plan collaboratively with the parent or legal guardian and any other individuals identified by the parent or legal guardian. If appropriate, the child shall receive behavioral therapy, medication, or combination therapy within the primary care practice setting.\n\n(4) Consultation via telephone or telehealth with faculty and staff of the departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychiatric Nursing, and Developmental Pediatrics, and the Munroe-Meyer Institute Psychology Department, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center shall be available to the primary care practice and the children as needed to manage the care of children with mental or behavioral health issues that require more specialized care than can be provided by the primary care practice.\n\n(5) Data on the pilot program shall be collected and evaluated by the Interdisciplinary Center for Program Evaluation at the Munroe-Meyer Institute of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Evaluation of the pilot program shall include, but not be limited to:\n\n(a) The number of referrals for behavioral health screening under the pilot program;\n\n(b) Whether each referral is initiated by a parent, a school, or a physician;\n\n(c) The number of children and adolescents recommended for further psychological assessment after screening for a possible behavioral health disorder;\n\n(d) The number and type of further psychological assessments of children and adolescents recommended and conducted;\n\n(e) The number and type of behavioral health disorders in children and adolescents diagnosed as a result of a further psychological assessment following a behavioral health screening under the pilot program;\n\n(f) The number and types of referrals of children and adolescents for behavioral health treatment from primary care medical practitioners;\n\n(g) The number of children and adolescents successfully treated for a behavioral health disorder based upon patient reports, parent ratings, and academic records;\n\n(h) The number and type of referrals of children and adolescents to psychiatric backup services at the University of Nebraska Medical Center;\n\n(i) The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with a behavioral health disorder who are successfully managed or treated through psychiatric backup services from the University of Nebraska Medical Center;\n\n(j) The number and types of medications, consultations, or prescriptions ordered by psychiatric nurse practitioners for children and adolescents;\n\n(k) The number of referrals of children and adolescents for severe behavioral health disorders and consultations to child psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, or psychologists specializing in treatment of adolescents;\n\n(l) The number of children and adolescents referred to psychiatric hospitals or emergency departments of acute care hospitals for treatment for dangerous or suicidal behavior;\n\n(m) The number of children and adolescents prescribed psychotropic medications and the types of such psychotropic medications; and\n\n(n) Data collection on program costs and financial impact as related to capacity for replication in other primary care practices. Primary program costs include physician and psychologist time for conducting screenings, family interviews, further testing, and specialist consulting costs relating to consulting services by psychiatric nurses, developmental pediatricians, and psychologists. Treatment or medications paid by private insurance, the medical assistance program, or the State Children's Health Insurance Program shall not be included in program costs pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(6) This section terminates two years after September 6, 2015.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB556, § 4;Laws 2015, LB240, § 1.",
