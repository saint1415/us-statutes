Access to such records shall be provided upon request pursuant to sections 71-8401 to 71-8407, except that mental health medical records may be withheld if any treating physician, psychologist, or mental health practitioner determines in his or her professional opinion that release of the records would not be in the best interest of the patient unless the release is required by court order. The request and any authorization shall be in writing. If an authorization does not contain an expiration date or specify an event the occurrence of which causes the authorization to expire, the authorization shall expire twelve months after the date the authorization was executed by the patient.\n\n(2) Upon receiving a written request for a copy of the patient's medical records under subsection (1) of this section, the provider shall furnish the person making the request a copy of such records not later than thirty days after the written request is received.\n\n(3) Upon receiving a written request to examine the patient's medical records under subsection (1) of this section, the provider shall, as promptly as required under the circumstances but no later than ten days after receiving the request: (a) Make the medical records available for examination during regular business hours; (b) inform the patient if the records do not exist or cannot be found; (c) if the provider does not maintain the records, inform the patient of the name and address of the provider who maintains such records, if known; or (d) if unusual circumstances have delayed handling the request, inform the patient in writing of the reasons for the delay and the earliest date, not later than twenty-one days after receiving the request, when the records will be available for examination. The provider shall furnish a copy of medical records to the patient as provided in subsection (2) of this section if requested.\n\n(4) This section does not require the retention of records or impose liability for the destruction of records in the ordinary course of business prior to receipt of a request made under subsection (1) of this section.
