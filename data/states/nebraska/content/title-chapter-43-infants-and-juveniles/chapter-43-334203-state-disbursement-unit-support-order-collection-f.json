After a payor has originated one payment resulting in a returned check or an electronic payment not accepted within a period of two years, the unit may issue a notice to the originator that, for the following year, any payment shall be required to be paid by money order, cashier's check, certified check, or any other form of guaranteed payment as may be approved by the unit. After a payor has originated two payments resulting in returned checks or electronic payments not accepted, the unit may issue a notice to the originator that all future payments shall be paid by money order, cashier's check, certified check, or any other form of guaranteed payment as may be approved by the unit, except that pursuant to rule and regulation and at least two years after such issuance of notice, the unit may waive for good cause shown such requirements for methods of payment. The fees shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the State Disbursement Unit Cash Fund, which is hereby created, which funds shall be used to offset the expenses incurred in the collection of child support bad debt and other collection expenses incurred by the unit. Any money in the fund available for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.\n\n(3) The State Disbursement Unit shall use automated procedures, electronic processes, and computer-driven technology to the maximum extent feasible, efficient, and economical for the collection and disbursement of support payments.\n\n(4) Employers with more than fifty employees who have an employee with a child support order shall remit child support payments electronically.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 972, § 3;Laws 2002, LB 1062, § 4;Laws 2005, LB 116, § 21;Laws 2008, LB620, § 1;Laws 2019, LB505, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Capital Expansion Act, see section 72-1269.Nebraska State Funds Investment Act, see section 72-1260.",
