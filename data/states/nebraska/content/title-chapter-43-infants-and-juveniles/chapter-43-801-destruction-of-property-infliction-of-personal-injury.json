VIII, Neb. Const. art. I, sec. 9, and Neb. Const. art. VII, sec. 5. Distinctive Printing & Packaging Co. v. Cox, 232 Neb. 846, 443 N.W.2d 566 (1989).\n\nThis section does not violate either the prohibition against special legislation contained in Neb. Const. art. III, sec. 18, or the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV on the ground that the liability of parents of children who intentionally inflict personal injury is limited and the liability of parents whose children intentionally inflict property damage is not. Distinctive Printing & Packaging Co. v. Cox, 232 Neb. 846, 443 N.W.2d 566 (1989).\n\nThis section may not be characterized as imposing punitive damages in contravention of Neb. Const. art.

Cox, 232 Neb. 846, 443 N.W.2d 566 (1989).\n\nAction of trial court in dismissing action as to parents for tort of child upheld. Neill v.
