The grant does not create an independent, continuing right to caretaking authority, decisionmaking authority, or limited contact in an individual to whom it is granted.\n\n(b) A nonparent granted caretaking authority, decisionmaking authority, or limited contact under sections 43-4613 to 43-4623 has standing to enforce the grant until it is terminated by court order or under sections 43-4624 to 43-4627.\n\nSourceLaws 2015, LB219, § 20.",
