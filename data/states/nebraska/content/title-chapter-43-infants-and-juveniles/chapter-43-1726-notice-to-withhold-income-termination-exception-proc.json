The notice to withhold income shall terminate with respect to the employer or other payor without any court action or action by the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department thirty days after the obligor ceases employment with or is no longer entitled to income from such employer or other payor, except that a notice to withhold income shall not terminate with respect to unemployment compensation benefits being withheld by the Commissioner of Labor pursuant to section 48-647. The employer or other payor shall return a copy of the notice to withhold income to the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department, indicate that the employment or obligation to pay income has ceased, and cooperate in providing any known forwarding information. The county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department shall notify the clerk of the appropriate district court that such employment or obligation to pay income has ceased. A notice to withhold income shall also terminate when the child, spousal, or medical support obligation terminates, all past-due support has been paid, and any monetary judgments have been paid, in which case the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department shall notify the employer or other payor to cease withholding income.\n\nSourceLaws 1985, Second Spec.
