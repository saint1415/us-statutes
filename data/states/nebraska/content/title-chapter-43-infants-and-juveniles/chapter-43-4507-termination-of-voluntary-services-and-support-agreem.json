      "text": "43-4507.Termination of voluntary services and support agreement; notice; appeal; procedure; department; duties.\n\n(1) A young adult may choose to terminate the voluntary services and support agreement and stop receiving services and support under the bridge to independence program at any time. If a young adult chooses to terminate the voluntary services and support agreement, the department shall provide the young adult with a clear and developmentally appropriate written notice informing the young adult of the potential negative effects of terminating the voluntary services and support agreement early, the option to reenter the bridge to independence program at any time before attaining twenty-one years of age, the procedures for reentering the bridge to independence program, and information about and contact information for community resources that may benefit the young adult, specifically including information regarding state programs established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 677.\n\n(2) If the department determines that the young adult is no longer eligible for the bridge to independence program under section 43-4504, the department may terminate the voluntary services and support agreement and stop providing services and support to the young adult. Academic breaks in postsecondary education attendance, such as semester and seasonal breaks, and other transitions between eligibility requirements under section 43-4504, including education and employment transitions of no longer than thirty days, shall not be a basis for termination. Even if a young adult's voluntary services and support agreement has been previously terminated by either the department or the young adult, the young adult may come back into the bridge to independence program by entering into another voluntary services and support agreement at any time, so long as he or she is eligible under section 43-4504. At least thirty days prior to the termination of the voluntary services and support agreement, the department shall provide a clear and developmentally appropriate written notice to the young adult informing the young adult of the termination of the voluntary services and support agreement and a clear and developmentally appropriate explanation of the basis for the termination. The written termination notice shall also provide information about the process for appealing the termination, information about the option to enter into another voluntary services and support agreement once the young adult reestablishes eligibility under section 43-4504, and information about and contact information for community resources that may benefit the young adult, specifically including information regarding state programs established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 677. In addition, the independence coordinator shall make efforts to meet with the young adult in person to explain the information in the written termination notice and to assist the young adult in reestablishing eligibility if the young adult wishes to continue participating in the program. The young adult may appeal the termination of the voluntary services and support agreement and any other actions or inactions by the department administratively, as allowed under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(3) If the young adult remains in the bridge to independence program until attaining twenty-one years of age, the department shall provide the young adult with a clear and developmentally appropriate written notice informing the young adult of the termination of the voluntary services and support agreement and information about and contact information for community resources that may benefit the young adult, specifically including information regarding state programs established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 677.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB216, § 7;Laws 2014, LB853, § 36.\n\nCross ReferencesAdministrative Procedure Act, see section 84-920.",
