In re Interest of DeWayne G., Jr. & Devon G., 263 Neb. 43, 638 N.W.2d 510 (2002).\n\nThe terms \"care\" and \"custody\" as used in this section are not synonymous. In re Interest of Jeremy T., 257 Neb. 736, 600 N.W.2d 747 (1999).\n\nThis statutory provision, by its liberal use of the word \"may,\" authorizes the juvenile court to exercise broad discretion in its disposition of children who have been found to be abused or neglected. In re Interest of Amber G. et al., 250 Neb. 973, 554 N.W.2d 142 (1996).\n\nThis section does not authorize the Department of Social Services to determine or place restrictions on parental visitation rights; rather, such rights are matters for judicial determination. In re Interest of C.A., 235 Neb. 893, 457 N.W.2d 822 (1990).\n\nDisposition of juveniles adjudged within section 43-247 is pursuant to sections 43-283 to 43-2,101. In re Interest of C.G. and G.G.T., 221 Neb. 409, 377 N.W.2d 529 (1985).\n\nThe dispositional statutes (sections 43-283 to 43-2,101) do not violate the equal protection provisions of either the U.S. Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Nebraska, because they validly classify status offenders, who do not violate the state's criminal law, on the one hand, and juvenile criminal offenders, on the other, who violate the state's criminal law by their own volitional acts. In re Interest of C.G. and G.G.T., 221 Neb. 409, 377 N.W.2d 529 (1985).\n\nWhen a juvenile is adjudicated under subsection (3) of section 43-247, the juvenile court may permit the juvenile to remain in his or her own home subject to supervision or may make an order committing the juvenile to the care and custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. In re Interest of Alex F. & Tony F., 23 Neb. App. 195, 870 N.W.2d 150 (2015).\n\nThe juvenile court may permit a juvenile adjudged to be under section 43-247(3) to remain in his or her own home subject to supervision or may make an order committing the juvenile to the care of some suitable institution, reputable citizen, or suitable family or to the care and custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. In re Interest of Crystal T. et al., 7 Neb. App. 921, 586 N.W.2d 479 (1998).",
