The agreement does not create an independent, continuing right to caretaking authority, decisionmaking authority, or limited contact in an individual to whom custodial responsibility is given.\n\n(b) A nonparent who has caretaking authority, decisionmaking authority, or limited contact by an agreement under sections 43-4608 to 43-4612 has standing to enforce the agreement until it has been terminated by court order, by modification under section 43-4610, or under sections 43-4624 to 43-4627.\n\nSourceLaws 2015, LB219, § 9.",
