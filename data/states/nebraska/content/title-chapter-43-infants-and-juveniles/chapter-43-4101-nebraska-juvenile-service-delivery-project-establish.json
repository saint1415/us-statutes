The reimbursed funds received by the department shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Probation Program Cash Fund for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Office of Probation Administration pursuant to the Nebraska Juvenile Service Delivery Project.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB985, § 1;Laws 2013, LB269, § 4.",
