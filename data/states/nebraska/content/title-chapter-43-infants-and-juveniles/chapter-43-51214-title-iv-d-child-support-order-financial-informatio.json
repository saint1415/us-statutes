The parent requesting review shall also provide an affidavit regarding the financial circumstances of the nonrequesting parent upon the request of the department. Failure by a nonrequesting parent to provide adequate financial information shall create a rebuttable presumption that such parent's income has changed for purposes of section 43-512.12.\n\nReferral of an order to a county attorney or authorized attorney under this section shall create a rebuttable presumption that there has been a material change in financial circumstances of one of the parents such that the child support obligation shall be increased at least ten percent if there is inadequate financial information regarding the noncustodial parent or that the child support obligation shall be decreased at least ten percent if there is inadequate financial information regarding the custodial parent. Such referral shall also be sufficient to rebut the presumption specified in section 42-364.16, and the court, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, may order a decrease or an increase of at least ten percent in the child support obligation as provided in this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 715, § 15;Laws 1993, LB 523, § 9;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 165;Laws 1997, LB 307, § 66.",
