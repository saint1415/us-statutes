If the child, the guardian ad litem, the caregiver, or a party to the proceeding believes that the child has not had regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in such activities, the juvenile court may make appropriate findings or orders to ensure the child has regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age and developmentally appropriate activities. In making such findings or orders, the court shall give deference to the caregiver in making decisions within the reasonable and prudent parent standard.\n\nSourceLaws 2016, LB746, § 11.",
