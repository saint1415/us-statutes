      "text": "43-1727.Income withholding notice; modification or revocation; notice.\n\n(1) An income withholding notice may be modified or revoked by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department as a result of a review conducted pursuant to sections 43-512.12 to 43-512.18. An income withholding notice may also be modified or revoked by a court of competent jurisdiction, for other good cause shown, after notice and a hearing on the issue. An income withholding notice may also be modified or revoked by the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department as provided in subsection (2) of this section or for other good cause. Payment by the obligor of overdue support or any monetary judgment, other than through income withholding, after receipt of notice of income withholding shall not by itself constitute good cause for modifying or revoking an income withholding notice.\n\n(2) When income withholding has been implemented and, as a result, a support delinquency has been eliminated, the Title IV-D Division or its designee shall notify the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department. Upon receipt of such notification, the county attorney, the authorized attorney, or the department shall modify the income withholding notice to require income withholding for current support and any monetary judgments and shall notify the employer or other payor of the change in the same manner as provided in section 43-1723.\n\nSourceLaws 1985, Second Spec.
