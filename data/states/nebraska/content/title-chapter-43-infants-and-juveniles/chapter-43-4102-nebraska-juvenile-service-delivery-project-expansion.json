      "text": "43-4102.Nebraska Juvenile Service Delivery Project; expansion; funding; information-sharing process; established.\n\n(1) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Nebraska Juvenile Service Delivery Project, established as a pilot program under section 43-4101 within the Office of Probation Administration, be expanded statewide in a three-step, phase-in process beginning July 1, 2013, with full implementation by July 1, 2014. The expansion of the project will result in the Office of Probation Administration taking over the duties of the Office of Juvenile Services with respect to its previous functions of community supervision and parole of juvenile law violators and of evaluations for such juveniles. The Office of Juvenile Services shall continue for the purpose of operating the youth rehabilitation and treatment centers and the care and custody of the juveniles placed at such centers. Expansion of the project shall be funded by the transfer of funds from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Juvenile Services used to fully fund community-based services and juvenile parole to the Office of Probation Administration.\n\n(2) There shall be established through the use of technology an information-sharing process to support and enhance the exchange of information between the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Probation Administration, and the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate two hundred fifty thousand dollars from the General Fund to the Office of Probation Administration to facilitate the information-sharing process.\n\n(3) Costs incurred on behalf of juveniles under the Nebraska Juvenile Service Delivery Project shall be paid as provided in section 43-290.01.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB561, § 55;Laws 2014, LB464, § 32.",
