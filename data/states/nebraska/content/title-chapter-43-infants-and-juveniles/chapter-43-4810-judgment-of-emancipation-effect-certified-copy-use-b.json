For the purposes described in this subsection, the minor shall be considered in law as an adult and any obligation or benefit he or she incurs is enforceable by and against such minor without regard to his or her minority.\n\n(2) A minor emancipated by court order shall be considered to have the rights and responsibilities of an adult, except for those specific constitutional and statutory age requirements regarding voting, use of alcoholic beverages, gambling, use of tobacco, and other health and safety regulations relevant to the minor because of his or her age.\n\n(3) The emancipated minor shall be provided a certified copy of the judgment of emancipation at the time the judgment is entered. Upon presentation of the judgment of emancipation, a third party shall be allowed to retain a copy of the same as proof of the minor’s ability to act as stated in this section.\n\n(4) Unless otherwise provided in the judgment of emancipation, the judgment of emancipation shall explicitly suspend any order regarding custody, parenting time, or support of the minor and be reported by the district court clerk to the jurisdiction that issued such order.\n\nSourceLaws 2018, LB714, § 10.",
