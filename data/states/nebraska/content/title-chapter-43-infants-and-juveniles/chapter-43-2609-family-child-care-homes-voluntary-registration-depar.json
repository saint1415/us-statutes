The department shall promulgate standards for such voluntary registration. The application for registration shall include the applicant's social security number. The department shall not make payments for child care, from any state or federal funds, to any family child care home provider not voluntarily registered under this section.\n\n(3) The department shall issue a certificate of registration to any family child care home provider registered pursuant to this section.\n\n(4) For purposes of implementing voluntary registration, the department may contract with family child care home associations or full-service community-based agencies to carry out such voluntary registration procedures for the department.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 836, § 9;Laws 1995, LB 401, § 9;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 221;Laws 1997, LB 307, § 91;Laws 1997, LB 752, § 107.",
