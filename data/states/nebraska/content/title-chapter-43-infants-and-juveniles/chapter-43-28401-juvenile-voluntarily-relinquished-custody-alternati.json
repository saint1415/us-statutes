If the court makes such finding, then alternative disposition may be made as provided under section 43-284. Such alternative disposition shall relieve the department or licensed child placement agency of all responsibility with regard to such juvenile.\n\nSourceLaws 1985, LB 447, § 9;Laws 1989, LB 182, § 11;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 131;Laws 2013, LB561, § 21.",
