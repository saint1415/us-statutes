Abandonment, for purposes of permitting substitute consent, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re Guardianship of Sain, 211 Neb. 508, 319 N.W.2d 100 (1982).Under subsection (3) of this section, the county court is the proper court for authorizing consent of a guardian appointed under former sections 38-101 to 38-120 or section 43-111.01, as the authority to appoint a guardian under those sections lies exclusively in the county court, while the juvenile court would be the proper court for a guardian appointed under sections 43-201 to 43-227 since the juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction to appoint a guardian under these sections. However, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court arises only if there has been a determination, prior to the adoption proceedings, that the child is dependent and neglected; otherwise the matter remains exclusively in the jurisdiction of the county court. Section 38-114 remains as the legislative bridge between the reference to former sections 38-101 to 38-120 in this section and the provisions of sections 30-2601 to 30-2616. A guardian appointed for a minor child for whom adoption is being sought by the use of substitute consent pursuant to this section should be an independent party not directly interested in the outcome of the adoption proceedings.
