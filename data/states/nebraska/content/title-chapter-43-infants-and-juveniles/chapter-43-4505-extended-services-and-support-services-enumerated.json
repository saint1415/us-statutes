As decided by and with the young adult, young adults may reside in a foster family home, a supervised independent living setting, an institution, or a foster care facility. Placement in an institution or a foster care facility should occur only if necessary due to a young adult's developmental level or medical condition. A young adult who is residing in a foster care facility upon leaving foster care may choose to temporarily stay until he or she is able to transition to a more age-appropriate setting. For young adults residing in a supervised independent living setting:\n\n(a) The department may send all or part of the foster care maintenance payments directly to the young adult. This should be decided on a case-by-case basis by and with the young adult in a manner that respects the independence of the young adult; and\n\n(b) Rules and restrictions regarding housing options should be respectful of the young adult's autonomy and developmental maturity. Specifically, safety assessments of the living arrangements shall be age-appropriate and consistent with federal guidance on a supervised setting in which the individual lives independently.

The case plan shall incorporate the independent living transition proposal in section 43-1311.03. A new plan shall be developed for young adults who have no previous independent living transition proposal. Case management shall also include, but not be limited to, documentation that assistance has been offered and provided that would help the young adult meet his or her personal goals, if such assistance is appropriate and if the young adult is eligible and consents to receive such assistance.
