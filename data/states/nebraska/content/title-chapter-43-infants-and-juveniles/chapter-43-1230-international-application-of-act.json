Such a determination shall create a rebuttable presumption against recognition and enforcement of the foreign child custody determination and, thereafter, a court of this state may exercise child custody jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) and subsection (c) of section 43-1238.\n\n(e) The changes made to this section by Laws 2007, LB 341, shall be deemed remedial and shall apply to all cases pending on or before February 2, 2007, and to all cases initiated subsequent thereto.\n\n(f) A court of this state shall have initial and continuing jurisdiction to make any determinations and to grant any relief set forth in subsection (d) of this section upon the motion or complaint seeking such, filed by any parent or custodian of a child who is the subject of a foreign court's custody determination and a habitual resident of Nebraska. The absence or dismissal, either voluntary or involuntary, of an action for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign court's custody determination under subsection (b) of this section shall in no way deprive the court of jurisdiction set forth in this subsection. Subsection (c) of section 43-1238 shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.\n\nThis subsection shall be deemed remedial and shall apply to all cases pending on or before March 6, 2009, and to all cases initiated subsequent thereto.\n\nSourceLaws 2003, LB 148, § 5;Laws 2007, LB341, § 13;Laws 2009, LB201, § 1.",
