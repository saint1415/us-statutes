All petitions filed with the board of the natural resources district must contain:\n\n(a) A statement of the problem involved;\n\n(b) A presentation of the project proposed;\n\n(c) A description of the area to be affected by the project; and\n\n(d) A request for a hearing.\n\n(2) If there are twenty or less landowners in the improvement project area, then the signatures of at least one-fourth must be on the petition. If there are more than twenty, then the signature of ten landowners shall be sufficient. Any petition regarding a project which would provide a revenue-producing continuing service shall contain so many signatures of landowners as shall in the board's discretion indicate enough interest to generate sufficient revenue to recover any reimbursable costs should a project be authorized.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 9, § 53, p. 131;Laws 1973, LB 206, § 5;Laws 2001, LB 136, § 2.",
