Such license shall not be transferable to another person or location and shall be prominently displayed to the public in the pesticide dealer's place of business.\n\n(5) If the pesticide dealer has had a license suspended or revoked, or has otherwise had a history of violations of the Pesticide Act, the department may require an additional demonstration of dealer qualifications prior to issuance or renewal of a license to such person.\n\n(6) Application for an initial pesticide dealer license shall be submitted to the department prior to commencing business as a pesticide dealer. Application for renewal of a pesticide dealer license shall be submitted to the department by January 1 of each year. All applications shall be accompanied by an annual license fee of twenty-five dollars. The fee may be increased by the director by rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to the act. The fee shall not exceed one hundred dollars per license. Application shall be on a form prescribed by the department and shall include the full name of the person applying for such license.

The purpose of the additional fee is to cover the administrative costs associated with collecting fees.\n\nAll fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Pesticide Administrative Cash Fund.\n\n(7) Each licensed pesticide dealer shall be responsible for the acts of each person employed by him or her in the solicitation and distribution of pesticides and all claims and recommendations for use of pesticides. The dealer's license shall be subject to denial, suspension, modification, or revocation after a hearing for any violation of the act, whether committed by the dealer or by the dealer's officer, agent, or employee.\n\n(8) The department shall require each pesticide dealer to maintain records of the dealer's purchases and distribution of all restricted-use pesticides and may require such records to be kept separate from other business records. The department may prescribe by rules and regulations the information to be included in the records. The dealer shall keep such records for a period of three years and shall provide the department access to examine such records and a copy of any record on request.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 267, § 34;Laws 1993, LB 588, § 14;Laws 1994, LB 884, § 8;Laws 1997, LB 752, § 54;Laws 2001, LB 329, § 5;Laws 2002, LB 436, § 8;Laws 2013, LB69, § 5;Laws 2019, LB320, § 7.",
