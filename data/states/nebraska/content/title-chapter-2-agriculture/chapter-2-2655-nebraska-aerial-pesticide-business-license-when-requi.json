      "text": "2-2655.Nebraska aerial pesticide business license; when required; liability; exempt operations.\n\n(1) A person shall not apply pesticides by use of an aircraft or cause or arrange aerial pesticide spraying operations to occur on the property of another unless such person holds a Nebraska aerial pesticide business license for the principal departure location of the aircraft to be used. Any person applying pesticides without a principal departure location licensed in this state and who applies pesticides by use of an aircraft within this state may obtain a Nebraska aerial pesticide business license for the principal out-of-state departure location. An individual licensed as a commercial applicator shall apply pesticides by use of an aircraft only under the direct supervision of a person holding a Nebraska aerial pesticide business license. Such supervising license holder is jointly liable with the commercial applicator for any damages caused by the commercial applicator. An individual who is licensed as a commercial applicator with an aerial pest control category may perform aerial operations without the supervision by a person holding a Nebraska aerial pesticide business license if the commercial aerial applicator acquires a Nebraska aerial pesticide business license. For purposes of sections 2-2655 to 2-2659, unless utilizing a licensed aerial pesticide business to perform the application of pesticides by use of an aircraft, a person causing or arranging aerial pesticide spraying operations shall include a person performing billing and collection of payment for aerial spraying services performed, employing or contracting with pilots to perform aerial applications, assigning aerial spraying work orders to pilots, or paying compensation to pilots for aerial spraying services performed whether or not such person is licensed as a commercial applicator.\n\n(2) Sections 2-2655 to 2-2659 shall not apply to aerial spraying operations conducted by federal, state, or local government with public aircraft.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB254, § 2.",
