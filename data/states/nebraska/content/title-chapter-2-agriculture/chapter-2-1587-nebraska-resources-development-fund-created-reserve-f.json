Unless disapproved by the Governor, the department may credit to such reserve fund that portion of any appropriation to the Nebraska Resources Development Fund which exceeds five million dollars. The department may also credit to the reserve fund such other funds as it determines are available.\n\n(3) Any money in the Nebraska Resources Development Fund available for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.\n\nSourceLaws 1974, LB 975, § 2;R.S.1943, (1977), § 2-3264;Laws 1984, LB 985, § 1;Laws 1986, LB 258, § 5;Laws 1995, LB 7, § 8;Laws 2000, LB 900, § 32;Laws 2009, First Spec.
