Prior to the issuance of a permanent sales permit by the department to any person for the sale of a tractor model, the board shall compare the test results with the manufacturer's representations as to power, fuel, and other ratings of the tractor model. If any such representations are found to be false, the board shall recommend that the department deny a permit for the sale of such tractor model. Any representation which a person makes with regard to the performance of its tractor at other than the customarily used power outlets shall be subject to test at the option of the board.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 425, art.
