Such an order shall specifically describe the nature of the violation found and the precise action necessary to bring the milk or milk products into compliance with the applicable provisions of the act. Such an order shall clearly advise the person in charge of the milk or milk products that he or she may request an immediate hearing before the director or his or her designee on the matter. The issuance of orders under this section shall be limited to instances in which no alternative course of action would sufficiently protect the public health, safety, or welfare.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 632, § 7;Laws 2001, LB 198, § 4;R.S.Supp.,2006, § 2-3907;Laws 2007, LB111, § 8.",
