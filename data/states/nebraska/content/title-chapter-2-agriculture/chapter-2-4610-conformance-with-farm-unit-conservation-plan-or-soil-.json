Such assistance may be used for any erosion or sediment control practice. The lack of available cost-sharing assistance does not offset the requirement that the owner and, if appropriate, the operator of such land comply with the terms of an approved plan of compliance or an administrative order.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, LB 474, § 10;Laws 1988, LB 594, § 4;Laws 1994, LB 480, § 24;Laws 2015, LB206, § 5.",
