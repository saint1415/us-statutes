Such benefits are not confined to historical and traditional societal benefits that accrue from the proper constraint of livestock, but also include suppression of civil disputes and public and private nuisances and the protection of public safety. Division fences promote the peace and security of society by the demarcation of rural boundaries, physical separation of conflicting land uses, enhancement of privacy, diminishment of frequency of public burden imposed by incidences of trespass and adverse possession, and the mitigation of impacts of conflicting land use intrusion into those areas of the state devoted to agricultural and horticultural use.\n\nSourceLaws 2010, LB667, § 1.",
