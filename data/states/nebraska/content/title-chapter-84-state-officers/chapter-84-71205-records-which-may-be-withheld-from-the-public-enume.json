Jacob v. Nebraska Bd. of Parole, 313 Neb. 109, 982 N.W.2d 815 (2022).\n\nDisclosure, within the meaning of the public records statutes, refers to the exposure of documents to public view. An exemption from disclosure should not be misunderstood as an exception to the laws of the public records statutes. State ex rel. BH Media Group v. Frakes, 305 Neb. 780, 943 N.W.2d 231 (2020).\n\nUnder subdivision (3) of this section, a public power district could not withhold its proprietary or commercial information that would give advantage to business competitors, because the district failed to demonstrate by clear and conclusive evidence that the information would serve no public purpose. Aksamit Resource Mgmt. v. Nebraska Pub. Power Dist., 299 Neb. 114, 907 N.W.2d 301 (2018).\n\nBecause the Legislature has expressed a strong public policy for disclosure, Nebraska courts must narrowly construe statutory exemptions shielding public records from disclosure. Evertson v. City of Kimball, 278 Neb. 1, 767 N.W.2d 751 (2009).\n\nIf a requesting party satisfies its prima facie claim for release of public records under section 84-712.03, the public body opposing disclosure must show by clear and convincing evidence that this section or section 84-712.08 exempts the records from disclosure. Evertson v. City of Kimball, 278 Neb. 1, 767 N.W.2d 751 (2009).\n\nThe investigatory record exception does not apply to protect material compiled ancillary to an agency's routine administrative functions or oversight activities. Evertson v. City of Kimball, 278 Neb. 1, 767 N.W.2d 751 (2009).\n\nUnder subdivision (5) of this section, a public body can withhold from the public records of its investigation into an employee's conduct only if the investigation focuses on specifically alleged illegal acts. Evertson v. City of Kimball, 278 Neb. 1, 767 N.W.2d 751 (2009).\n\nUnder subdivision (5) of this section, a public record is an investigatory record where (1) the activity giving rise to the document sought is related to the duty of investigation or examination with which the public body is charged and (2) the relationship between the investigation or examination and that public body's duty to investigate or examine supports a colorable claim of rationality. This two-part test provides a deferential burden-of-proof rule for a public body performing an investigation or examination with which it is charged. Evertson v. City of Kimball, 278 Neb. 1, 767 N.W.2d 751 (2009).\n\nA public record is an investigatory record under this section where (1) the activity giving rise to the document sought is related to the duty of investigation or examination with which the public body is charged and (2) the relationship between the investigation or examination and that public body's duty to investigate or examine supports a colorable claim of rationality. When an inquiry by an administrative agency departs from the routine and focuses with special intensity on a particular party, an investigation is underway for purposes of this section. Records that have been \"disclosed\" within the meaning of this section are only those records that a public body has, in its official capacity, already made available to the general public. State ex rel. Neb. Health Care Assn. v. Dept. of Health and Human Services Finance and Support, 255 Neb. 784, 587 N.W.2d 100 (1998).\n\nCourt upheld Attorney General's refusal to disclose requested documents pursuant to subsections (4) and (5) of this section. State ex rel. Sileven v. Spire, 243 Neb. 451, 500 N.W.2d 179 (1993).",
