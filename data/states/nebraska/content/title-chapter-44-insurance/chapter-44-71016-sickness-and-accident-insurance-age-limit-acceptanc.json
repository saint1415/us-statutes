In the event the age of the insured has been misstated and if, according to the correct age of the insured, the coverage provided by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to the acceptance of such premium or premiums, then the liability of the insurer shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums paid for the period not covered by the policy.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 188, § 17, p. 658;Laws 1989, LB 92, § 146.",
