The policy may provide that the term employees shall include the employees of one or more subsidiary corporations and the employees, individual proprietors, members, and partners of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietorships, or partnerships if the business of the employer and of the affiliated corporations, proprietorships, or partnerships is under common control. The policy may provide that the term employees shall include the individual proprietor or partners if the employer is an individual proprietorship or partnership. The policy may provide that the term employees may include retired employees, former employees, and directors of a corporate employer. The policy may provide that the term employees shall include the trustees or their employees, or both, if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship; and\n\n(2) The premium for the policy shall be paid from funds contributed by the employer or employers of the insured persons, by the union or unions or similar employee organizations, or by both, or from funds contributed by the insured persons or from both the insured persons and the employers or unions or similar employee organizations. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured persons specifically for their insurance shall insure all eligible persons, except those who reject the coverage in writing, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.\n\nSourceLaws 1949, c. 150, § 1(4), p. 380;Laws 1957, c. 192, § 4, p. 674;Laws 1969, c. 376, § 1, p. 1336;Laws 1989, LB 92, § 176;Laws 1993, LB 121, § 235;Laws 2008, LB855, § 12.",
