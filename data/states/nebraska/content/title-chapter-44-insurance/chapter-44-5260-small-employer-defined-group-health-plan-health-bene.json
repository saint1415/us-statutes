      "text": "44-5260.Small employer, defined; group health plan; health benefit plans; requirements; filing; exceptions; preexisting condition exclusion; network plans.\n\n(1) For purposes of this section, small employer shall mean, in connection with a group health plan with respect to a calendar year and a plan year, any person, firm, corporation, partnership, association, or political subdivision that is actively engaged in business that employed an average of at least two but not more than fifty employees on business days during the preceding calendar year and who employs at least two employees on the first day of the plan year. All persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be treated as one employer. Subsequent to the issuance of a health benefit plan to a small employer and for the purpose of determining continued eligibility, the size of a small employer shall be determined annually. Except as otherwise specifically provided, provisions of the Small Employer Health Insurance Availability Act that apply to a small employer shall continue to apply at least until the health benefit plan anniversary following the date the small employer no longer meets the requirements of this definition. In the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether the employer is a small or large employer shall be based on the average number of employees that it is reasonably expected the employer will employ on business days in the current calendar year. Any reference in the act to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.\n\n(2)(a) Every small employer carrier shall, as a condition of transacting business in this state with small employers, actively offer to small employers all health benefit plans it actively markets to small employers in this state, including at least two health benefit plans. One health benefit plan offered by each small employer carrier shall be a basic health benefit plan, and one plan shall be a standard health benefit plan. A small employer carrier shall be considered to be actively marketing a health benefit plan if it offers that plan to any small employer not currently receiving a health benefit plan by such small employer carrier. This subdivision shall not require a small employer carrier to offer to small employers a health benefit plan marketed only through a bona fide association.\n\n(b)(i) Subject to subdivision (2)(a) of this section, a small employer carrier shall issue any health benefit plan to any eligible small employer that applies for the plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other reasonable provisions of the health benefit plan not inconsistent with the Small Employer Health Insurance Availability Act. However, no small employer carrier shall be required to issue a health benefit plan to a self-employed individual who is covered by, or is eligible for coverage under, a health benefit plan offered by an employer.\n\n(ii) In the case of a small employer carrier that establishes more than one class of business, the small employer carrier shall maintain and issue to eligible small employers at least one basic health benefit plan and at least one standard health benefit plan in each class of business so established. A small employer carrier may apply reasonable criteria in determining whether to accept a small employer into a class of business if:\n\n(A) The criteria are not intended to discourage or prevent acceptance of small employers applying for a basic health benefit plan or a standard health benefit plan;\n\n(B) The criteria are not related to the health status or claim experience of employees or dependents of the small employer;\n\n(C) The criteria are applied consistently to all small employers applying for coverage in the class of business; and\n\n(D) The small employer carrier provides for the acceptance of all eligible small employers into one or more classes of business.\n\nThe provisions of subdivision (2)(b)(ii) of this section shall not apply to a class of business into which the small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new small businesses.\n\n(3)(a) A small employer carrier shall file with the director, in a format and manner prescribed by the director, the basic health benefit plans and the standard health benefit plans to be used by the carrier. A health benefit plan filed pursuant to this subsection may be used by a small employer carrier beginning thirty days after it is filed unless the director disapproves its use.\n\n(b) The director at any time may, after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the small employer carrier, disapprove the continued use by a small employer carrier of a basic health benefit plan or standard health benefit plan on the grounds that the plan does not meet the requirements of the act.\n\n(4) Health benefit plans covering small employers shall comply with the following provisions:\n\n(a) A health benefit plan shall not deny, exclude, or limit benefits for a covered individual for losses incurred more than twelve months, or eighteen months in the case of a late enrollee, following the enrollment date of the individual's coverage due to a preexisting condition or the first date of the waiting period for enrollment if that date is earlier than the enrollment date. A health benefit plan shall not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than as defined in section 44-5246.02. A health benefit plan shall not impose any preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy as a preexisting condition;\n\n(b) A health benefit plan shall not impose any preexisting condition exclusion:\n\n(i) To an individual who, as of the last day of the thirty-day period beginning with the date of birth, is covered under creditable coverage, and the individual had creditable coverage that was continuous to a date not more than sixty-three days prior to the enrollment date of new coverage; or\n\n(ii) To a child less than eighteen years of age who is adopted or placed for adoption and who, as of the last day of the thirty-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage, and the child had creditable coverage that was continuous to a date not more than sixty-three days prior to the enrollment date of new coverage;\n\n(c)(i) A small employer carrier shall waive any time period applicable to a preexisting condition exclusion or limitation period with respect to particular services in a health benefit plan for the aggregate period of time an individual was previously covered by creditable coverage that provided benefits with respect to such services if the creditable coverage was continuous to a date not more than sixty-three days prior to the enrollment date of new coverage. The period of continuous coverage shall not include any waiting period or affiliation period for the effective date of the new coverage applied by the employer or the carrier. This subdivision shall not preclude application of any waiting period applicable to all new enrollees under the health benefit plan.\n\n(ii) A small employer carrier that does not use preexisting condition limitations in any of its health benefit plans may impose an affiliation period:\n\n(A) That does not exceed sixty days for new entrants and does not exceed ninety days for late enrollees;\n\n(B) During which the carrier charges no premiums and the coverage issued is not effective; and\n\n(C) That is applied uniformly, without regard to any health-status-related factor.\n\n(iii) This subdivision does not preclude application of any waiting period applicable to all enrollees under the health benefit plan if any carrier waiting period is no longer than sixty days.\n\n(iv)(A) In lieu of the requirements of subdivision (4)(c)(i) of this section, a small employer carrier may elect to reduce the period of any preexisting condition exclusion based on coverage of benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in federal regulations.\n\n(B) A small employer electing to reduce the period of any preexisting condition exclusion using the alternative method described in subdivision (4)(c)(iv)(A) of this section shall make the election on a uniform basis for all enrollees and count a period of creditable coverage with respect to any class or category of benefits if any level of benefits is covered within the class or category.\n\n(C) A small employer carrier electing to reduce the period of any preexisting condition exclusion using the alternative method described in subdivision (4)(c)(iv)(A) of this section shall prominently state that the election has been made in any disclosure statements concerning coverage under the health benefit plan to each enrollee at the time of enrollment under the plan and to each small employer at the time of the offer or sale of the coverage and include in the disclosure statements the effect of the election;\n\n(d)(i) A small employer carrier shall permit an eligible employee or dependent, who requests enrollment following the open enrollment opportunity, to enroll, and the eligible employee or dependent shall not be considered a late enrollee if the eligible employee or dependent:\n\n(A) Was covered under another health benefit plan at the time the eligible employee or dependent was eligible to enroll;\n\n(B) Stated in writing at the time of the open enrollment period that coverage under another health benefit plan was the reason for declining enrollment but only if the health benefit plan or health carrier required such a written statement and provided a notice of the consequences of such written statement;\n\n(C) Has lost coverage under another health benefit plan as a result of the termination of employment, the termination of the other health benefit plan's coverage, death of a spouse, legal separation, or divorce or was under a continuation-of-coverage policy or contract available under federal law and the coverage was exhausted; and\n\n(D) Requests enrollment within thirty days after the termination of coverage under the other health benefit plan.\n\n(ii)(A) If a small employer carrier issues a health benefit plan and makes coverage available to a dependent of an eligible employee and such dependent becomes a dependent of the eligible employee through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, then such health benefit plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period during which the dependent may be enrolled under the health benefit plan and, in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of an eligible employee may be enrolled if otherwise eligible for coverage.\n\n(B) A dependent special enrollment period shall be a period of not less than thirty days and shall begin on the later of (I) the date such dependent coverage is available or (II) the date of the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.\n\n(C) If an eligible employee seeks to enroll a dependent during the first thirty days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective:\n\n(I) In the case of marriage, not later than the first day of the first month beginning after the date the completed request for enrollment is received;\n\n(II) In the case of the birth of a dependent, as of the date of birth; and\n\n(III) In the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, the date of such adoption or placement for adoption;\n\n(e)(i) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(e)(iv) of this section, requirements used by a small employer carrier in determining whether to provide coverage to a small employer, including requirements for minimum participation of eligible employees and minimum employer contributions, shall be applied uniformly among all small employers with the same number of eligible employees applying for coverage or receiving coverage from the small employer carrier.\n\n(ii) A small employer carrier may vary application of minimum participation requirements and minimum employer contribution requirements only by the size of the small employer group.\n\n(iii)(A) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(e)(iii)(B) of this section, in applying minimum participation requirements with respect to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall not consider employees or dependents who have creditable coverage in determining whether the applicable percentage of participation is met.\n\n(B) With respect to a small employer with ten or fewer eligible employees, a small employer carrier may consider employees or dependents who have coverage under another health benefit plan sponsored by such small employer in applying minimum participation requirements.\n\n(iv) A small employer carrier shall not increase any requirement for minimum employee participation or any requirement for minimum employer contribution applicable to a small employer at any time after the small employer has been accepted for coverage; and\n\n(f)(i) If a small employer carrier offers coverage to a small employer, the small employer carrier shall offer coverage to all of the eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents who apply for enrollment during the period in which the employee first becomes eligible to enroll under the terms of the plan. A small employer carrier shall not offer coverage to only certain individuals in a small employer group or to only part of the group except in the case of late enrollees as provided in subdivision (4)(a) of this section.\n\n(ii) Except as permitted under subdivisions (a) and (d) of this subsection, a small employer carrier shall not modify a health benefit plan with respect to a small employer or any eligible employee or dependent, through riders, endorsements, or otherwise, to restrict or exclude coverage or benefits for specific diseases, medical conditions, or services otherwise covered by the plan.\n\n(iii) A small employer carrier shall not place any restriction in regard to any health-status-related factor on an eligible employee or dependent with respect to enrollment or plan participation.\n\n(5) A small employer carrier shall not be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (2) of this section in the case of the following:\n\n(a) To an employee if previous basic health benefit plans or standard health benefit plans have, in the aggregate, paid one million dollars in benefits on behalf of the employee. Benefits paid on behalf of the employee in the immediately preceding two calendar years by prior small employer carriers under basic and standard plans shall be included when calculating the lifetime maximum benefits payable under the succeeding basic or standard plans. In any situation in which a determination of the total amount of benefits paid by prior small employer carriers is required by the succeeding carrier, prior carriers shall furnish a statement of the total benefits paid under basic and standard plans at the succeeding carrier's request; or\n\n(b) Within an area where the small employer carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director, that it will not have the capacity within its established geographic service area to deliver service adequately to the members of such groups because of its obligations to existing group policyholders and enrollees.\n\n(6)(a) A small employer carrier offering coverage through a network plan shall not be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to or from a small employer as defined in subsection (1) of this section:\n\n(i) If the small employer does not have eligible employees who live, work, or reside in the service area for such network plan; or\n\n(ii) If the small employer does have eligible employees who live, work, or reside in the service area for such network plan, the carrier has demonstrated, if required, to the director that it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to enrollees of any additional groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees and that it is applying subdivision (6)(a)(ii) of this section uniformly to all employers without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their employees and their dependents or any health-status-related factor relating to such employees and dependents.\n\n(b) A small employer carrier, upon denying health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with subdivision (6)(a)(ii) of this section, shall not offer coverage in the small employer market within such service area for a period of one hundred eighty days after the date such coverage is denied.\n\n(7) A small employer carrier shall not be required to provide coverage to small employers pursuant to subsection (2) of this section for any period of time for which the director determines that requiring the acceptance of small employers in accordance with the provisions of such subsection would place the small employer carrier in a financially impaired condition.\n\nSourceLaws 1994, LB 1222, § 38;Laws 1995, LB 837, § 4;Laws 1997, LB 862, § 46;Laws 2002, LB 1139, § 33;Laws 2009, LB192, § 8.",
