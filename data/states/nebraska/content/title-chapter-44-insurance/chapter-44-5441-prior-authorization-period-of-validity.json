If an adverse determination is overturned on appeal, and no other legal action related to the claim is pending, then the health carrier shall reimburse the health care provider at the contracted rate for inpatient care provided to the enrollee.\n\n(3) This section does not require a health benefit plan to cover care, treatment, or services for a health condition that the terms of coverage otherwise completely exclude from the policy's covered benefits without regard for whether the care, treatment, or services are medically necessary.\n\nSourceLaws 2025, LB77, § 10.Operative Date: January 1, 2026",
