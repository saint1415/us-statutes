No insurance company shall be liable or responsible to any person to determine or ascertain the existence or identity of any such judgment creditor prior to payment of any such proceeds, cash values, or benefits. This subsection shall apply to any judgment rendered on or after January 1, 1995, irrespective of when the criminal conviction is or was rendered and irrespective of whether proceedings for attachment, garnishment, or other legal or equitable process were pending on March 14, 1997.\n\nSourceLaws 1933, c. 73, § 1, p. 315;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 44-1130;R.S.1943, § 44-371;Laws 1980, LB 940, § 4;Laws 1981, LB 327, § 1;Laws 1987, LB 335, § 1;Laws 1997, LB 47, § 1;Laws 2005, LB 465, § 3;Laws 2017, LB268, § 8.\n\nAnnotations\n\nWhere this section is not applicable, an oral assignment or pledge of a life insurance policy by the named beneficiary, after the death of the insured, to secure a debt or obligation of the beneficiary, accompanied by delivery of the policy, constitutes a pledge entitling the pledgee to an equitable lien upon the proceeds of the policy.
