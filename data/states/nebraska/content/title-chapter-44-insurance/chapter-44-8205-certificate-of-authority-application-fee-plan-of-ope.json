The director shall deem that any captive insurer that has failed to disclose a transaction or a series of transactions that would circumvent the Captive Insurers Act to be in hazardous financial condition with respect to the public or its policyholders and subject to suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority of the captive insurer.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise authorized in section 44-8216, a captive insurer may only transact any line or lines of insurance specified in subdivisions (5), (7), (8), (9), (10), and (18) of section 44-201.
