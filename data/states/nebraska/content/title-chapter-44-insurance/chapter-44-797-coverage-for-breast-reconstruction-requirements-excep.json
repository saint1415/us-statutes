Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit normal underwriting.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an individual or group sickness and accident insurance policy, subscriber contract, or group health maintenance organization contract offering health insurance coverage from negotiating the level and type of reimbursement with a provider for care provided in accordance with this section.\n\n(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any individual or group policy or certificate which provides:\n\n(a) Coverage only for accident or disability income insurance, or any combination thereof;\n\n(b) Coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance;\n\n(c) Liability insurance, including general liability insurance and automobile liability insurance;\n\n(d) Workers' compensation or similar insurance;\n\n(e) Automobile medical payment insurance;\n\n(f) Credit-only insurance;\n\n(g) Coverage for onsite medical clinics;\n\n(h) Other similar insurance coverage, specified in federal regulations, under which benefits for medical care are secondary or incidental to other insurance benefits;\n\n(i) Limited-scope dental or vision benefits;\n\n(j) Benefits for long-term care, nursing home care, home health care, community-based care, or any combination thereof;\n\n(k) Such other similar, limited benefits as are specified in federal regulations;\n\n(l) Coverage only for a specified disease or illness;\n\n(m) Hospital indemnity or other fixed indemnity insurance;\n\n(n) Medicare supplemental health insurance as defined under section 1882(g)(1) of the Social Security Act, as such section existed on January 1, 2005;\n\n(o) Coverage supplemental to the coverage provided under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, as such chapter existed on January 1, 2005; and\n\n(p) Similar supplemental coverage provided to coverage under a group health plan.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 930, § 4;Laws 2005, LB 119, § 9.",
