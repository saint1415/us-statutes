      "text": "44-761.Group sickness and accident insurance; required provisions.\n\nEach group policy of sickness and accident insurance shall contain in substance the following provisions:\n\n(1) A provision that the policy, the application of the policyholder if such application or copy thereof is attached to such policy, and the individual applications, if any, submitted in connection with such policy by the employees or members, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, that all statements, in the absence of fraud, made by any applicant or applicants shall be deemed representations and not warranties, and that no such statement shall avoid the insurance or reduce benefits thereunder unless contained in a written application of which a copy is attached to the policy;\n\n(2) A provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder, for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, an individual certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features of the insurance coverage of such employee or member and to whom benefits thereunder are payable. If dependents are included in the coverage, only one certificate need be issued for each family unit;\n\n(3) A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy; and\n\n(4) A provision that the insurance coverage of the employee or member may include, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of the employee or member, any two or more eligible members of his or her family, including husband, wife, dependent children, any children enrolled on a full-time basis in any college, university, or trade school, or any children under a specified age which shall not exceed thirty years, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder. Any policy which provides that coverage of an unmarried dependent child shall terminate upon the attainment of the limiting age for unmarried dependent children specified in the policy shall also provide that attainment of such limiting age shall not operate to terminate the coverage of such child during the continuance of the insurance coverage of the employee or member under such policy and while such child is and continues to be (a) incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental or physical handicap and (b) chiefly dependent upon the policyholder for support and maintenance, if proof of such incapacity and dependency is furnished to the insurer by the policyholder within thirty-one days of such child's attainment of the limiting age and subsequently as may be required by the insurer but not more frequently than annually after the two-year period following such child's attainment of the limiting age. The insurer may charge an additional premium for and with respect to any such continuation of coverage beyond the limiting age of the policy, which premium shall be determined by the insurer on the basis of the class of risks applicable to such child. The provisions of this subdivision shall be contained in all new policies of group sickness and accident insurance delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state. No group policy of sickness and accident insurance shall contain any provisions which are in conflict with sections 44-3,144 to 44-3,150.\n\nSourceLaws 1947, c. 164, § 16(2), p. 469;Laws 1976, LB 649, § 1;Laws 1989, LB 92, § 153;Laws 1994, LB 1224, § 79;Laws 2009, LB551, § 2.\n\nAnnotations\n\nGroup accident policy may insure eligible members of family including wife.
