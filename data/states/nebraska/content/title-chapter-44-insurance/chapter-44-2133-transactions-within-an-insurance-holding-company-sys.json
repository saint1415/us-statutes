      "text": "44-2133.Transactions within an insurance holding company system; standards.\n\n(1) Transactions within an insurance holding company system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards:\n\n(a) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;\n\n(b) Agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall include such provisions as are required by rules and regulations which the director may adopt and promulgate;\n\n(c) Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;\n\n(d) Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;\n\n(e) The books, accounts, and records of each party to all such transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties; and\n\n(f) The insurer's policyholders surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.\n\n(2) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section which are subject to any materiality standards contained in subdivisions (2)(a) through (e) of this section, shall not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the director in writing of its intention to enter into such transaction at least thirty days prior thereto or such shorter period as the director may permit and the director has not disapproved it within such period. The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported, within thirty days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the director for determination of the type of filing required, if any:\n\n(a) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments if such transactions are equal to or exceed (i) with respect to an insurer other than a life insurer, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of policyholders surplus as of December 31 next preceding and (ii) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 next preceding;\n\n(b) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, when the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in any affiliate of the insurer making such loans or extensions of credit if such transactions are equal to or exceed (i) with respect to an insurer other than a life insurer, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of policyholders surplus as of December 31 next preceding and (ii) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 next preceding;\n\n(c) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including (i) all reinsurance pooling agreements and (ii) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities or the projected reinsurance premium or change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three years equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer's policyholders surplus as of December 31 next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;\n\n(d) All management agreements, service contracts, tax-allocation agreements, and cost-sharing arrangements; and\n\n(e) Any material transactions, specified by rule and regulation, which the director determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\n(3) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the director determines that such separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for such purpose, the director may exercise his or her authority under sections 44-2143 to 44-2147.\n\n(4) The director, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\n(5) The director shall be notified within thirty days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent of such corporation's voting securities.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 236, § 13;Laws 2012, LB887, § 9.",
