Special rates shall be provided for children under eighteen years of age.\n\n(b) For calendar years prior to January 1, 2010, the pool, with the assistance of an independent actuary, shall determine the standard risk rate by calculating the average individual rate charged by the five insurers writing the largest amount of individual health insurance coverage in the state actuarially adjusted to be comparable with the pool coverage, except that such five insurers shall not include any insurer which has not been writing individual health insurance coverage in this state in at least the three preceding calendar years. The selection of the independent actuary shall be subject to the approval of the director. In the event five insurers do not offer comparable coverage, the standard risk rate shall be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and shall reflect anticipated risk experience and expenses for such coverage.
