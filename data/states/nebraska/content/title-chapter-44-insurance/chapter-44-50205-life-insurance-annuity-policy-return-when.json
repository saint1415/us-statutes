If a policyholder or a purchaser pursuant to such notice returns the policy to the insurer at its home office or branch office or to the agent or agency through which it was purchased, the policy shall be void from the beginning and the parties shall be in the same position as if no policy had been issued.\n\nSourceLaws 1989, LB 92, § 128.",
