In no event may any action be commenced to recover damages for malpractice or professional negligence or breach of warranty in rendering or failing to render professional services more than ten years after the date of rendering or failing to render such professional service which provides the basis for the cause of action.\n\nSourceLaws 1976, LB 434, § 28;Laws 1984, LB 692, § 9.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe continuous treatment doctrine for limitations in a malpractice action applies only for incorrect treatment based on misdiagnosis or other continuing course of negligent treatment. Bogue v. Gillis, 311 Neb. 445, 973 N.W.2d 338 (2022).\n\nWhile section 30-810 includes a general statute of limitations applicable to wrongful death actions, this section is a subsequently enacted special statute of limitations applicable to all personal injury and wrongful death actions against health care providers who have taken the necessary steps to qualify under the Nebraska Hospital-Medical Liability Act. Alegent Health Bergan Mercy Med. Ctr. v. Haworth, 260 Neb. 63, 615 N.W.2d 460 (2000).\n\nThe discovery exception contained in this section is a tolling provision which permits the filing of an action after the 2-year period only in those circumstances where the cause of action was not discovered and could not reasonably have been discovered within that period. Weaver v. Cheung, 254 Neb. 349, 576 N.W.2d 773 (1998).\n\nThe language in this section is identical in all material respects to that contained in section 25-222, which applies to professional negligence actions governed by the common law. Giese v. Stice, 252 Neb. 913, 567 N.W.2d 156 (1997).\n\nIn medical malpractice cases, the period of limitations or repose begins to run when the treatment rendered after and relating to the allegedly wrongful act or omission is completed.
