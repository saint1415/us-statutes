The matter of any credit to be deducted from a judgment shall be determined by the court in a separate hearing or upon the stipulation of the parties.\n\n(2) Damages recoverable in any action shall be those losses which have been or shall be sustained by the claimant as a direct and proximate result of the defendant's wrongful acts as established by a preponderance of the evidence. In wrongful death actions, pecuniary loss to a widow or widower, any dependent, or next of kin shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of sections 44-2801 to 44-2855.\n\nSourceLaws 1976, LB 434, § 19.",
