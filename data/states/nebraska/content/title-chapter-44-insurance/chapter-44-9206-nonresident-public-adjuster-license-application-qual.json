A licensed nonresident public adjuster shall notify the director of any change to a new home state as soon as possible, but no later than thirty days after receiving a license as a resident public adjuster from the new home state. The nonresident public adjuster shall include both the new and the old addresses in the notice to the director.\n\nSourceLaws 2018, LB743, § 6.",
