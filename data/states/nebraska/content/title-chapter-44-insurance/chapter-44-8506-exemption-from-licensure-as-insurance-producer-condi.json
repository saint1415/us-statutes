The training required by this subdivision shall comply with the following:\n\n(i) The training shall be delivered to employees and authorized representatives of a vendor who are directly involved in the activity of selling or offering for sale portable electronics insurance;\n\n(ii) The training may be provided in electronic form. If the training is provided in electronic form, the supervising entity shall implement a supplemental education program that is conducted and overseen by licensed employees of the supervising entity; and\n\n(iii) Each employee and authorized representative shall receive basic instruction on the portable electronics insurance offered to customers and the disclosures required by section 44-8505; and\n\n(c) The vendor does not advertise, represent, or otherwise hold itself or any of its employees or authorized representatives out as authorized insurers or licensed insurance producers.\n\n(2) The charges for portable electronics insurance coverage may be billed and collected by the vendor. Any charge to the customer for coverage that is not included in the cost associated with the purchase or lease of portable electronics shall be separately itemized on the covered customer's bill. If the portable electronics insurance coverage is included in the purchase or lease of portable electronics or related services, the vendor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the customer that portable electronics insurance coverage is included with the portable electronics or related services. No vendor shall require the purchase of any kind of insurance specified in this section as a condition of the purchase or lease of portable electronics or services. If such insurance is purchased, the portable electronics insurance coverage offered by the limited lines insurance licensee to a customer is primary over any other insurance coverage applicable to the portable electronics. A vendor who bills and collects such charges shall not be required to maintain such funds in a segregated account if the vendor is authorized by the insurer to hold such funds in an alternative manner and remits such amounts to the supervising entity within sixty days after receipt. All funds received by a vendor from a covered customer for the sale of portable electronics insurance shall be considered funds held in trust by the vendor in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the insurer. A vendor may receive compensation for billing and collection services.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB535, § 6.",
