Any limited two-way payment provision in a netting agreement or qualified financial contract with an insurer that has defaulted shall be deemed to be a full two-way payment provision as against the defaulting insurer. Any such amount, except to the extent it is subject to one or more secondary liens or encumbrances, shall be a general asset of the insurer.\n\n(3) In making any transfer of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract of an insurer subject to a proceeding under the act, the receiver shall do one of the following:\n\n(a) Transfer to one party, other than an insurer subject to a proceeding under the act, all netting agreements and qualified financial contracts between a counterparty or any affiliate of the counterparty and the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding, including all of the following:\n\n(i) All rights and obligations of each party under each netting agreement and qualified financial contract; and\n\n(ii) All property, including any guarantees or credit support documents, securing any claims of each party under each such netting agreement and qualified financial contract; or\n\n(b) Transfer none of the netting agreements, qualified financial contracts, rights, obligations, or property referred to in subdivision (a) of this subsection with respect to the counterparty and any affiliate of the counterparty.\n\n(4) If a receiver for an insurer makes a transfer of one or more netting agreements or qualified financial contracts, the receiver shall use his or her best efforts to notify any person who is party to the netting agreement or qualified financial contract of the transfer by noon of the receiver's local time on the business day following the transfer. For purposes of this subsection, business day means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or any day on which either the New York Stock Exchange or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is closed.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the act to the contrary, a receiver shall not avoid a transfer of money or other property arising under or in connection with a netting agreement or qualified financial contract or any pledge, security, collateral, or guarantee agreement or any other similar security arrangement or credit support document relating to a netting agreement or qualified financial contract that is made before the commencement of a formal delinquency proceeding under the act. However, a transfer may be avoided under section 44-4828 if the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the insurer, a receiver appointed for the insurer, or an existing or future creditor.\n\n(6)(a) In exercising any of its powers under the act to disaffirm or repudiate a netting agreement or qualified financial contract, the receiver shall take action with respect to each netting agreement or qualified financial contract and all transactions entered into in connection therewith in its entirety.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the act to the contrary, any claim of a counterparty against the estate arising from the receiver's disaffirmance or repudiation of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract that has not been previously affirmed in the liquidation or in the immediately preceding rehabilitation case shall be determined and allowed or disallowed as if the claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if a rehabilitation proceeding is converted to a liquidation proceeding, as if the claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition for rehabilitation. The amount of the claim shall be the actual direct compensatory damages determined as of the date of the disaffirmance or repudiation of the netting agreement or qualified financial contract. For purposes of this subdivision, actual direct compensatory damages does not include punitive or exemplary damages, damages for lost profit or lost opportunity, or damages for pain and suffering, but does include normal and reasonable costs of cover or other reasonable measures of damages utilized in the derivatives market for the contract and agreement claims.\n\n(7) For purposes of this section, contractual right includes any right, whether or not evidenced in writing, arising under (a) statutory or common law, (b) a rule or bylaw of a national securities exchange, a national securities clearing organization, or a securities clearing agency, (c) a rule or bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of a contract market or its clearing organization, or (d) law merchant.\n\n(8) This section does not apply to persons who are affiliates of the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding.\n\n(9) All rights of a counterparty under the act shall apply to netting agreements and qualified financial contracts entered into on behalf of the general account or separate accounts, if the assets of each separate account are available only to counterparties to netting agreements and qualified financial contracts entered into on behalf of that separate account.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB72, § 7.",
