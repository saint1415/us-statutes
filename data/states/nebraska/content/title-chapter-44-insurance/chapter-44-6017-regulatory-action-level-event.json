The risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan shall be submitted:\n\n(a) Within forty-five days after the occurrence of the regulatory action level event;\n\n(b) If the insurer or health organization challenges an adjusted risk-based capital report pursuant to section 44-6020 and the challenge is not frivolous in the judgment of the director, within forty-five days after the notification to the insurer or health organization that the director has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer's or health organization's challenge; or\n\n(c) If the insurer or health organization challenges a revised risk-based capital plan pursuant to section 44-6020 and the challenge is not frivolous in the judgment of the director, within forty-five days after the notification to the insurer or health organization that the director has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer's or health organization's challenge.\n\n(4) The director may retain actuaries and investment experts and other consultants as may be necessary in the judgment of the director to review the insurer's or health organization's risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan, to examine or analyze the assets, liabilities, and operations, including contractual relationships in the case of a health organization, of the insurer or health organization, and to formulate the corrective order with respect to the insurer or health organization. The fees, costs, and expenses relating to consultants shall be borne by the affected insurer or health organization or such other party as directed by the director.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 583, § 29;Laws 1994, LB 978, § 39;Laws 1999, LB 258, § 22.",
