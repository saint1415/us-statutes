The copy of the application for, or notice of proposed insurance, shall refer exclusively to insurance coverage, and shall be separate and apart from the loan, sale or other credit statement of account, instrument or agreement, unless the information required by this subsection is prominently set forth therein. Upon acceptance of the insurance by the insurer and within thirty days of the date upon which the indebtedness is incurred, the insurer shall cause the individual policy or group certificate of insurance to be delivered to the debtor. The application or notice of proposed insurance shall state that upon acceptance by the insurer, the insurance shall become effective as of the date the indebtedness is incurred.\n\nSourceLaws 1959, c. 214, § 7, p. 739.\n\nAnnotations\n\nDebtor was aware that total credit insurance was fifteen thousand dollars and failure to deliver policy or certificate to debtor did not preclude recovery on note for larger amount.
