If the director does not approve the contract, he or she shall so notify the respective insurers in writing specifying his or her reasons therefor. If approved by the director, the contract shall then be submitted to the shareholders of the ceding company for their approval as provided in subsection (1) of this section. If approved by the required vote of the shareholders, the contract shall then become effective.\n\nSourceLaws 1957, c. 180, § 3, p. 620;Laws 1989, LB 92, § 73.",
