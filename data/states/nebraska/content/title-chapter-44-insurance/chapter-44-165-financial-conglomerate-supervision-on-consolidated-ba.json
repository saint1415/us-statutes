Supervision under this section shall be in addition to all statutory and regulatory requirements imposed on domestic insurers and shall be for the purpose of determining how the operations of the financial conglomerate impact insurance operations.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n\n(i) Control has the same meaning as in section 44-2121; and\n\n(ii) Financial conglomerate means either an insurance company domiciled in Nebraska or a person established under the laws of the United States, any state, or the District of Columbia which directly or indirectly controls an insurance company domiciled in Nebraska. Financial conglomerate includes the person applying for supervision under this section and all entities, whether insurance companies or otherwise, to the extent the entities are controlled by such person.\n\n(2) The director may approve any application for supervision under this section that meets the requirements of this section and the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section.\n\n(3)(a) The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for supervision of a financial conglomerate, including all persons controlled by a financial conglomerate, that will permit the director to assess at the level of the financial conglomerate the financial situation of the financial conglomerate, including solvency, risk concentration, and intra-group transactions.\n\n(b) Such rules and regulations shall require the financial conglomerate to:\n\n(i) Have in place sufficient capital adequacy policies at the level of the financial conglomerate;\n\n(ii) Report to the director at least annually any significant risk concentration at the level of the financial conglomerate;\n\n(iii) Report to the director at least annually all significant intra-group transactions of regulated entities within a financial conglomerate. Such reporting shall be in addition to all reports required under any other provision of Chapter 44; and\n\n(iv) Have in place at the level of the financial conglomerate adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative and accounting procedures.\n\n(c) In adopting and promulgating the rules and regulations, the director:\n\n(i) Shall consider the rules and regulations that may be adopted by a member state of the European Union, the European Union, or any other country for the supervision of financial conglomerates;\n\n(ii) Shall require the filing of such information as the director may determine;\n\n(iii) Shall include standards and processes for effective qualitative group assessment, quantitative group assessment including capital adequacy, affiliate transaction, and risk concentration assessment, risks and internal capital assessments, disclosure requirements, and investigation and enforcement powers;\n\n(iv) Shall state that supervision of financial conglomerates concerns how the operations of the financial conglomerate impact the insurance operations;\n\n(v) Shall adopt an application fee in an amount not to exceed the amount necessary to recover the cost of review and analysis of the application; and\n\n(vi) May verify information received under this section.\n\n(4)(a) If it appears to the director that a financial conglomerate that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section, or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof, willfully violates this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section, the director may order the financial conglomerate to cease and desist immediately any such activity. After notice and hearing, the director may order the financial conglomerate to void any contracts between the financial conglomerate and any of its affiliates or among affiliates of the financial conglomerate and restore the status quo if such action is in the best interest of policyholders, creditors, or the public.\n\n(b) If it appears to the director that any financial conglomerate that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section, or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof, has committed or is about to commit a violation of this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section, the director may apply to the district court of Lancaster County for an order enjoining such financial conglomerate, director, officer, employee, or agent from violating or continuing to violate this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the financial conglomerate's policyholders, creditors, or the public may require.\n\n(c)(i) Any financial conglomerate that fails, without just cause, to provide information which may be required under the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section may be required by the director, after notice and hearing, to pay an administrative penalty of one hundred dollars for each day's delay not to exceed an aggregate penalty of ten thousand dollars. The director may reduce the penalty if the financial conglomerate demonstrates to the director that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the financial conglomerate.\n\n(ii) Any financial conglomerate that fails to notify the director of any action for which such notification may be required under the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section may be required by the director, after notice and hearing, to pay an administrative penalty of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars per violation.\n\n(iii) Any violation of this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section shall be an unfair trade practice under the Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act in addition to any other remedies and penalties available under the laws of this state.\n\n(d) Any director or officer of a financial conglomerate that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section who knowingly violates or assents to any officer or agent of the financial conglomerate to violate this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section may be required by the director, after notice and hearing, to pay in his or her individual capacity an administrative penalty of not more than five thousand dollars per violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, the director shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.\n\n(e) After notice and hearing, the director may terminate the supervision of any financial conglomerate under this section if it ceases to qualify as a financial conglomerate under this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section.\n\n(f) If it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section which so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section as to threaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business by such financial conglomerate hazardous to its policyholders or the public, the director may proceed as provided in the Nebraska Insurers Supervision, Rehabilitation, and Liquidation Act to take possession of the property of such domestic insurer and to conduct the business thereof.\n\n(g) If it appears to the director that any person that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section has committed a violation of this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section which makes the continued operation of an insurer contrary to the interests of policyholders or the public, the director may, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew such insurer's license or authority to do business in this state for such period as the director finds is required for the protection of policyholders or the public. Any such determination shall be accompanied by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(h)(i) Any financial conglomerate that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section that willfully violates this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section shall be guilty of a Class IV felony.\n\n(ii) Any director, officer, employee, or agent of a financial conglomerate that submits to the jurisdiction of the director under this section who willfully violates this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section or who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made any false statements, false reports, or false filings with the intent to deceive the director in the performance of his or her duties under this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section shall be guilty of a Class IV felony.\n\n(iii) Any person aggrieved by any act, determination, order, or other action of the director pursuant to this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section may appeal. The appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(iv) Any person aggrieved by any failure of the director to act or make a determination required by this section or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under this section may petition the district court of Lancaster County for a writ in the nature of a mandamus or a peremptory mandamus directing the director to act or make such determination forthwith.\n\n(i) The powers, remedies, procedures, and penalties governing financial conglomerates under this section shall be in addition to any other provisions provided by law.\n\n(5)(a) The director may contract with such qualified persons as the director deems necessary to allow the director to perform any duties and responsibilities under this section.\n\n(b) The reasonable expenses of supervision of a financial conglomerate under this section shall be fixed and determined by the director who shall collect the same from the supervised financial conglomerate. The financial conglomerate shall reimburse the amount upon presentation of a statement by the director. All money collected by the director for supervision of financial conglomerates pursuant to this section shall be remitted in accordance with section 44-116.\n\n(c) All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained by or disclosed to the director pursuant to this section shall be held by the director in accordance with sections 44-154 and 44-2138.\n\nSourceLaws 2008, LB855, § 50;Laws 2014, LB700, § 14.\n\nCross ReferencesAdministrative Procedure Act, see section 84-920.Nebraska Insurers Supervision, Rehabilitation, and Liquidation Act, see section 44-4862.Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act, see section 44-1521.",
