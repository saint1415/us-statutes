The term of such insurance shall not extend more than fifteen days beyond the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness except when extended without additional cost to the debtor. If the indebtedness is discharged due to renewal or refinancing prior to the scheduled maturity date, the insurance in force shall be terminated before any new insurance may be issued in connection with the renewed or refinanced indebtedness and if the indebtedness is discharged due to a prepayment, the insurance in force shall be terminated as of the date of the prepayment. In all cases of termination prior to scheduled maturity, a refund shall be paid or credited as provided in section 44-1709.\n\nSourceLaws 1959, c. 214, § 6, p. 739;Laws 1969, c. 377, § 2, p. 1338.",
