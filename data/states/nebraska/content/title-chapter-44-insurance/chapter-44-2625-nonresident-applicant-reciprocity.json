The director may accept, in lieu of examination of such nonresident, a certificate of the director or commissioner of the other state or province to the effect that the applicant is licensed in the state or province in a capacity similar to that for which a license is sought in this state. In instances when a reciprocal agreement has not been reached, the director shall require an examination.\n\nSourceLaws 1980, LB 481, § 20.",
