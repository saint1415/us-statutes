Notwithstanding any request from the director, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this subsection if the director is the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance group.\n\n(2) The report shall include a signature of the insurer's or insurance group's chief risk officer or other executive having responsibility for the oversight of the insurer's enterprise risk management process attesting to the best of his or her belief and knowledge that the insurer applies the enterprise risk management process described in the own risk and solvency assessment summary report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.\n\n(3) An insurer may comply with subsection (1) of this section by providing the most recent and substantially similar report provided by the insurer or another member of an insurance group of which the insurer is a member to the insurance commissioner of another state or to a supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction if that report provides information that is comparable to the information described in the own risk and solvency assessment guidance manual. Any such report in a language other than English must be accompanied by a translation of that report into the English language.\n\n(4) The first filing of the own risk and solvency assessment summary report shall be in 2015.\n\nSourceLaws 2014, LB700, § 7.",
