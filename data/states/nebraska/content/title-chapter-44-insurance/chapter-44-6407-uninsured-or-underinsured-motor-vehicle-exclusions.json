Alsidez v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 282 Neb. 890, 807 N.W.2d 184 (2011).\n\nNebraska's Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance Coverage Act specifically excludes government-owned vehicles from the definition of \"underinsured motor vehicle\" and thus permits exclusion of government-owned vehicles from the definition of \"underinsured motor vehicle\" in an automobile insurance policy. Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Conn, 262 Neb. 147, 629 N.W.2d 494 (2001).",
