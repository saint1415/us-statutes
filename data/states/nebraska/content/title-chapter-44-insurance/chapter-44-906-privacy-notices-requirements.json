When describing the categories of parties to whom disclosure is made, the licensee is required to state only that it makes disclosures to other affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties, as applicable, as permitted by law.(3) If a licensee does not disclose, and does not wish to reserve the right to disclose, nonpublic personal financial information about customers or former customers to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties except as authorized under sections 44-914 and 44-915, the licensee may simply state that fact, in addition to the information it shall provide under subdivisions (1)(a), (1)(h), and (1)(i) of this section and subsection (2) of this section.(4)(a) A licensee may satisfy the initial notice requirements in subdivision (1)(b) of section 44-904 and subsection (3) of section 44-907 for a consumer who is not a customer by providing a short form initial notice at the same time as the licensee delivers an opt out notice as required in section 44-907.(b) A short form initial notice shall:(i) Be clear and conspicuous;(ii) State that the licensee's privacy notice is available upon request; and(iii) Explain a reasonable means by which the consumer may obtain that notice.
