and\n\n(B) The covered person or the covered person's authorized representative may file a grievance under the health carrier's internal grievance process as set forth in section 44-7308, but if the health carrier has not issued a written decision to the covered person or his or her authorized representative within the time allowed for an internal grievance pursuant to section 44-7308 and the covered person or his or her authorized representative has not requested or agreed to a delay, the covered person or his or her authorized representative may file a request for external review pursuant to section 44-1306 and shall be considered to have exhausted the health carrier's internal grievance process for purposes of section 44-1307; and\n\n(ii) For a notice related to a final adverse determination, a statement informing the covered person that:\n\n(A) If the covered person has a medical condition in which the timeframe for completion of a standard external review pursuant to section 44-1308 would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the covered person or would jeopardize the covered person's ability to regain maximum function, the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative may file a request for an expedited external review pursuant to section 44-1309; or\n\n(B) If the final adverse determination concerns:\n\n(I) An admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the covered person received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility, the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative may request an expedited external review pursuant to section 44-1309; or\n\n(II) A denial of coverage based on a determination that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is experimental or investigational, the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative may file a request for a standard external review to be conducted pursuant to section 44-1310 or if the covered person's treating physician certifies in writing that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment that is the subject of the request would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated, the covered person or his or her authorized representative may request an expedited external review to be conducted under section 44-1310.\n\n(b) In addition to the information to be provided pursuant to subdivision (2)(a) of this section, the health carrier shall include a copy of the description of both the standard and expedited external review procedures that the health carrier is required to provide pursuant to section 44-1317 and shall highlight the provisions in the external review procedures that give the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative the opportunity to submit additional information and include any forms used to process an external review.\n\n(c) As part of any forms provided under subdivision (2)(b) of this section, the health carrier shall include an authorization form or other document approved by the director that complies with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. 164.508, by which the covered person, for purposes of conducting an external review under the Health Carrier External Review Act, authorizes the health carrier and the covered person's treating health care provider to disclose protected health information, including medical records, concerning the covered person that are pertinent to the external review.\n\nSourceLaws 2013, LB147, § 5;Laws 2016, LB840, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesUtilization Review Act, see section 44-5416.",
