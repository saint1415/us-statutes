If the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the director, the insurer shall provide the director a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of the information. If it appears to the director that the detailed explanation is without merit, the director may require, after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of one hundred dollars for each day's delay, not to exceed an aggregate penalty of ten thousand dollars, or may suspend or revoke the insurer's certificate of authority.\n\n(2) The director may retain at the registered insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts who are not employees of the Department of Insurance as shall be reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under this section. Any persons so retained shall be under the direction and control of the director and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.\n\n(3) Each registered insurer producing for examination records, books, and papers pursuant to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the expense of such examination in accordance with the Insurers Examination Act.\n\n(4) If the insurer fails to comply with an order, the director may examine the affiliates to obtain the information. The director may also issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and examine under oath any person for purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable by contempt of court. Every person shall be obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. He or she shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in the district court, which fees, mileage, and actual expenses, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of witnesses and their testimony, shall be itemized, charged against, and paid by the entity being examined.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 236, § 17;Laws 1993, LB 583, § 85;Laws 2012, LB887, § 11.\n\nCross ReferencesInsurers Examination Act, see section 44-5901.",
