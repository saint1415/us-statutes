      "text": "44-7515.Exemption from the requirement for insurers to use filed rates and policy forms for certain commercial policyholders; eligibility for professional employer organizations.\n\n(1) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to modify or eliminate requirements for insurers to use filed rates and policy forms for commercial policyholders under common ownership identified through the application of subsection (4) of this section. Unless set forth by rules and regulations, on and after January 1, 2012, eligibility for a professional employer organization shall be based upon the professional employer organization's total premiums, including premiums for multiple coordinated policies written for the professional employer organization's clients. Unless otherwise set forth in the rules and regulations, the rules and regulations apply to multiple coordinated policies written on behalf of an eligible professional employer organization.\n\n(2) The rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section may establish requirements and thresholds that differ by line or type of insurance or that differ for rates and policy forms.\n\n(3) The rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section shall require insurers to inform exempt commercial policyholders at the earliest practical date, but no later than thirty days after the inception of coverage, of those policy forms applying to them that have not been approved by the director.\n\n(4) The director shall consider the following factors in determining those commercial policyholders to which the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section shall apply:\n\n(a) For modification or elimination of the applicability of filed rates, characteristics of insureds that are likely to avail themselves of regular price comparisons between competing insurers and are likely to study and understand the differences and details of pricing proposals that they receive;\n\n(b) For modification or elimination of the applicability of filed rates, characteristics of insureds for which filed rates and rating plans are less likely to provide the lowest premiums otherwise consistent with the provisions of the Property and Casualty Insurance Rate and Form Act;\n\n(c) Modification or elimination of the applicability of filed rates for commercial insureds that are primarily located in another jurisdiction where they are subject to similar exemptions or waivers in that jurisdiction;\n\n(d) For modification or elimination of the applicability of filed policy forms, characteristics of insureds that are likely to study and understand the details of their business risks and insurance coverages and exclusions;\n\n(e) For modification or elimination of the applicability of filed policy forms, characteristics of insureds that are likely to require individually written policies, as contrasted to insureds that can customarily have their coverage needs met using policy forms that could also be used for other insureds;\n\n(f) For both rates and policy forms, favorable or adverse experiences with the modification or elimination of regulatory requirements, especially the experience in this state; and\n\n(g) Any other relevant factor.\n\n(5) For exempt commercial policyholders to which rating system regulation is made otherwise inapplicable, insurers shall allocate premiums between policies, exposures, and states in proportion to the expected losses and expenses for those policies, exposures, and states.\n\n(6) The following restrictions apply to rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section:\n\n(a) The rules and regulations may not allow any reduction of the benefits payable under workers' compensation or excess workers' compensation policies or any alteration of provisions for the handling and settlement of claims under such policies, but the rules and regulations may allow exempt commercial policyholders to negotiate workers' compensation or excess workers' compensation premiums and premium payment provisions;\n\n(b) The rules and regulations may not allow any reduction of automobile insurance coverage limits to less than those required by Nebraska law, but the rules and regulations may allow exempt commercial policyholders to negotiate automobile insurance premiums and premium payment provisions;\n\n(c) The rules and regulations may not allow any limitation of the coverage provisions necessary for health care providers to qualify under the Nebraska Hospital-Medical Liability Act, but the rules and regulations may allow exempt commercial policyholders to negotiate medical professional liability insurance premiums and premium payment provisions;\n\n(d) The rules and regulations may not reduce the rate regulatory requirements applying to insurance written for a professional employer organization on or after January 1, 2012, or to any insurance written for an individual policyholder that is not a client of a professional employer organization with total premiums of less than twenty-five thousand dollars for lines of insurance subject to the Property and Casualty Insurance Rate and Form Act; and\n\n(e) The rules and regulations may not reduce the form regulatory requirements applying to insurance written for a professional employer organization on or after January 1, 2012, or to any insurance written for an individual policyholder that is not a client of a professional employer organization with total premiums of less than fifty thousand dollars for lines of insurance subject to the Property and Casualty Insurance Rate and Form Act.\n\n(7) Policy forms for commercial risks exempted by the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section may include language that conflicts with section 44-501. If a conflict results between a policy form and the requirements of section 44-501, the language in the policy form shall apply to the extent that it is inconsistent with such section.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 1119, § 15;Laws 2002, LB 1139, § 54;Laws 2003, LB 216, § 23;Laws 2010, LB579, § 13.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Hospital-Medical Liability Act, see section 44-2855.",
