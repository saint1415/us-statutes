When determining the twelve percent of definite profit that is permitted to pay the allowable expenses of operating a lottery by the sale of pickle cards, the definite profit from the sale of pickle cards at the organization's bingo occasions shall not be included.\n\n(4) Not more than thirty percent of the definite profit of a pickle card unit shall be used by a licensed organization to pay a pickle card operator a commission, fee, or salary for selling individual pickle cards as opportunities for participation in a lottery by the sale of pickle cards on behalf of the licensed organization.\n\n(5) An organization licensed to conduct bingo pursuant to the Nebraska Bingo Act may allocate a portion of the expenses associated with the conduct of its bingo occasions to its lottery by the sale of pickle cards conducted at such bingo occasions. Such allocation shall be based upon the percentage that pickle card gross proceeds derived from the sale of pickle cards at the bingo occasions represents to the total of bingo gross receipts and pickle card gross proceeds derived from such bingo occasions for the previous annual reporting period.

No expenses associated with the conduct of bingo may be paid directly from the pickle card checking account. A licensed organization which needs to allocate a portion of the expenses associated with the conduct of its bingo occasions to its lottery by the sale of pickle cards conducted at such bingo occasions to pay bingo expenses as provided by this section shall transfer funds from the pickle card checking account to the bingo checking account by a check drawn on the pickle card checking account or by electronic funds transfer.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, LB 1027, § 113;Laws 1988, LB 1232, § 45;Laws 1989, LB 767, § 43;Laws 1994, LB 694, § 89;Laws 1995, LB 344, § 18;Laws 2002, LB 545, § 34;Laws 2009, LB286, § 2.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Bingo Act, see section 9-201.",
