For this purpose, the Chief Water Officer may require an owner to lower the water level of or to drain the reservoir.\n\n(5) If, upon inspection or upon completion to the satisfaction of the Chief Water Officer of all work ordered, the Chief Water Officer finds that the dam is safe to impound, an approval to operate shall be issued.\n\n(6) If at any time the Chief Water Officer finds that the dam is not safe to impound, the Chief Water Officer shall notify the owner in writing and shall set a time and place for hearing on the matter. The owner of such dam shall ensure that such dam does not impound following receipt of such notice. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed, at least thirty days prior to the date set for the hearing, to the owner. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and present his or her views and objections to the proposed action.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 335, § 70;Laws 2025, LB317, § 308.Operative Date: July 1, 2025",
