Drainage Dist. No. 1 v. Suburban Irr. Dist., 139 Neb. 460, 298 N.W. 131 (1941).\n\nSenior appropriator is entitled to water as against an upstream junior appropriator, as long as water in usable quantities can be delivered to senior appropriator. State ex rel. Cary v. Cochran, 138 Neb. 163, 292 N.W. 239 (1940).\n\nIt is the duty of the state to see that the waters of its streams used for irrigation purposes will not be wasted and that prior appropriators shall be protected as against subsequent appropriators. State ex rel. Sorensen v. Mitchell Irr. Dist., 129 Neb. 586, 262 N.W. 543 (1935).\n\nWhile Nebraska was originally a riparian doctrine state, legislation was enacted adopting the principle of prior appropriation. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589 (1945).\n\nUnited States cannot claim assignment to it of excess waters under an appropriation, as excess would inure to benefit of other appropriators prior in time to United States.
