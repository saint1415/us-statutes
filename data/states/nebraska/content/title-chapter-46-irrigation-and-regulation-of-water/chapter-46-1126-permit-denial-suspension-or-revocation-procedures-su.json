On the basis of the evidence presented, the proposed action shall be affirmed or set aside. A copy of such decision setting forth the findings of fact and the specific reasons upon which it is based shall be sent to the applicant or permitholder.\n\n(2) If the district or department concludes that there is or may be an actual or imminent threat of danger to persons or the environment by the operation of a chemigation system, the district or department shall immediately order suspension of the operation of the system. Any aggrieved person may, within ten days of receipt of an order of suspension pursuant to this section, request a hearing on such order. The hearing shall be held within ten days of receipt of the request. The district or department shall give written notice of the hearing by certified or registered mail or by personal service to the permitholder, applicator, or person responsible for the operation of the chemigation system. The district or department shall issue an order addressing the matters raised at the hearing within ten days after the hearing.\n\nIf the district or department concludes that the suspension should be continued, the district or department may, if necessary, apply for a restraining order or a temporary or permanent injunction against the permitholder, applicator, or person responsible for the operation of the chemigation system pursuant to the procedure prescribed by section 46-1138.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, LB 284, § 26;Laws 1989, LB 619, § 2.",
