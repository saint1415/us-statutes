The owners of such dam shall provide such engineering study as a condition to requesting such overlay zoning.\n\n(4) The Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act does not preempt or supersede any local zoning ordinances, resolutions, rules, or regulations regarding special use permits enacted by a political subdivision with respect to permit applications for livestock waste control facilities.\n\nSourceLaws 2005, LB 335, § 37;Laws 2025, LB317, § 278.Operative Date: July 1, 2025",
