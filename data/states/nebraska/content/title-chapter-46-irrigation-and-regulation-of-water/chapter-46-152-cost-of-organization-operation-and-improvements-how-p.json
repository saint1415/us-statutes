If, after the annual assessment for the current year, the funds provided are for some unusual or unforeseen cause insufficient for the proper maintenance and operation of the district, the board of directors shall have the power to borrow additional funds needed, to an amount not to exceed fifty cents per acre for the land embraced in the district, pledging credit of the district for the payment of the same, and shall include in the estimate for the levy for the ensuing year for the general fund the amount so borrowed, and provide for the payment of the same.\n\nSourceLaws 1895, c. 70, § 24, p. 287;Laws 1899, c. 78, § 2, p. 334;Laws 1913, c. 37, § 1, p. 132;R.S.1913, § 3482;Laws 1915, c. 69, § 8, p. 180;C.S.1922, § 2882;C.S.1929, § 46-127;R.S.1943, § 46-152;Laws 1967, c. 280, § 2, p. 758.",
