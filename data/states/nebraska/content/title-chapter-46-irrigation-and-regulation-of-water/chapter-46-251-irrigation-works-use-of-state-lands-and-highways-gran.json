      "text": "46-251.Irrigation works; use of state lands and highways; grant; right-of-way; condemnation.\n\nAll persons desirous of constructing any of the works provided for in sections 46-244 to 46-250 shall have the right to occupy state lands and obtain right-of-way over and across any highway in this state for such purpose without compensation, except public school lands. All bridges or crossings over such ditches, laterals, and canals shall be constructed under the supervision of the Department of Transportation, if on a state highway, and under the supervision of the county board or governing body of a municipality, if on a highway under the jurisdiction of such board or governing body. All such persons may obtain a right-of-way not to exceed sixteen feet in width, for a like purpose along, parallel to, and upon one side of any highway by condemnation proceedings where the same does not interfere with the proper drainage of such highway. In such cases the abutting landowner and the county may grant such right-of-way, or in case of their refusal notice shall be served upon them and proceedings had as in other cases. Not more than one such ditch or lateral shall be permitted along the side of the same highway.\n\nSourceLaws 1919, c. 190, tit. VII, art.
