Within six months after the approval of an application for water power and before placing water to any beneficial use, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the State of Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer, for leasing the use of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by the Chief Water Officer, and the time of such lease shall not run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use of water for power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on or before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred horsepower for all water so appropriated.

If the lessee has not come into compliance with all provisions of the lease or has not paid to the Chief Water Officer all required fees within fifteen calendar days after the date of such notice, the Chief Water Officer shall issue an order denying the applicant the right to divert or otherwise use the water appropriation for power production. The Chief Water Officer shall rescind the order denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the lessee has come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid all required fees to the Chief Water Officer. If after forty-five calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not been paid to the Chief Water Officer, such lease and water appropriation shall be canceled by the Chief Water Officer.\n\nSourceLaws 1921, c. 291, § 1, p. 942;C.S.1922, § 8437;C.S.1929, § 81-6318;R.S.1943, § 46-236;Laws 1972, LB 1306, § 1;Laws 1987, LB 140, § 7;Laws 2000, LB 900, § 111;Laws 2011, LB27, § 1;Laws 2025, LB317, § 93.Operative Date: July 1, 2025\n\nAnnotations\n\nState may lease use of public waters for power purposes.
