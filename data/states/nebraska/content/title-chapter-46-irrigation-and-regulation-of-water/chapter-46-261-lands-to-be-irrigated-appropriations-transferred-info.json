If the appropriator claims sufficient cause for nonuse, he or she shall also provide the Chief Water Officer with any evidence the Chief Water Officer requires as a condition for accepting such claimed cause as sufficient cause to excuse nonuse.\n\n(5) The Chief Water Officer may deny an appropriator the right to any water to be delivered to or used by or through any ditch, reservoir, or other contrivance for the appropriation, use, or storage of water if the appropriator is not in compliance with this section, with subsection (2) of section 46-230, or with any conditions of any permit, notice, or order of the Chief Water Officer concerning the appropriation. The Chief Water Officer may construct bars or dams or may install such other devices as are necessary to prevent such delivery or use.\n\nSourceLaws 1919, c. 190, tit. VII, art.
