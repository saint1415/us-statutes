Applications shall include plans and specifications detailing the intended times, amounts, and streamreach locations and such other information as required by the Chief Water Officer. The water subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for the use specified in the permit.

All damages resulting therefrom shall be determined in the manner set forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.\n\n(4) Any person holding a storage use permit pursuant to section 46-242 shall not be required to obtain the permit required by this section.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a person from obtaining any other permits required by law.\n\nSourceLaws 1919, c. 190, tit.
