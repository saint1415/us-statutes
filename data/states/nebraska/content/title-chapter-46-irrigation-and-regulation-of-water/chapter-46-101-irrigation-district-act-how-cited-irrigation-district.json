Halstead v. Farmers Irr. Dist., 200 Neb. 314, 263 N.W.2d 475 (1978).\n\nProvision of public power district law did not apply to irrigation districts. Baum v. County of Scotts Bluff, 172 Neb. 225, 109 N.W.2d 295 (1961).\n\nWhere plaintiff's land was never included in district his right to abandon use of irrigation water was not controlled by irrigation district act.

Dist., 155 Neb. 141, 51 N.W.2d 253 (1952).\n\nAn irrigation district organized under the laws of Nebraska and irrigating lands wholly within this state is subject to the irrigation laws of this state regardless of the fact that the district's headgates and diversion works may be in an adjoining state. State ex rel. Sorensen v. Mitchell Irr. Dist., 129 Neb. 586, 262 N.W. 543 (1935).\n\nJudgment of board as to matters submitted to it by statute cannot be collaterally attacked, but question whether land is under ditch already constructed of sufficient capacity to water same, is not left to adjudication of board.
