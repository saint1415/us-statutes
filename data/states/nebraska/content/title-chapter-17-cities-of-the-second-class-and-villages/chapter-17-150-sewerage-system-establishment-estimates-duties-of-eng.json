In advertising for bids for any such work or materials, the city council shall cause the amount of such estimate to be published with such advertisement for at least twenty days in a legal newspaper in or of general circulation in the city.\n\nSourceLaws 1903, c. 22, § 2, p. 255;R.S.1913, § 5044;C.S.1922, § 4213;C.S.1929, § 17-152;R.S.1943, § 17-150;Laws 2017, LB133, § 40.",
