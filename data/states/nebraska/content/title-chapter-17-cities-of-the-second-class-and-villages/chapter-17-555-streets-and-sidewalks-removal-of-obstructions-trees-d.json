Notice to abate and remove such nuisance and notice of the right to a hearing and the manner in which it may be requested shall be given to each owner or owner's duly authorized agent and to the occupant, if any. The city or village shall establish the method of notice by ordinance. If notice is given by first-class mail, such mail shall be conspicuously marked as to its importance. Within five days after receipt of such notice, the owner or occupant of the lot or piece of ground may request a hearing with the city or village to appeal the decision to abate or remove the nuisance by filing a written appeal with the office of the city clerk or village clerk. A hearing on the appeal shall be held within fourteen days after the filing of the appeal and shall be conducted by an elected or appointed officer as designated in the ordinance. The hearing officer shall render a decision on the appeal within five business days after the conclusion of the hearing. If the appeal fails, the city or village may have the work done to abate and remove the dead or diseased trees. If the owner or occupant of the lot or piece of ground does not request a hearing with the city or village within five days after receipt of such notice or fails to comply with the order to abate and remove the nuisance, the city or village may have such work done. The city or village may levy and assess all or any portion of the costs and expenses of the work upon the lot or piece of ground so benefited as a special assessment.\n\n(3) Cities of the second class or villages may regulate the building of bulkheads, cellar and basement ways, stairways, railways, windows, doorways, awnings, lampposts, awning posts, all other structures projecting upon or over and adjoining, and all other excavations through and under the sidewalks in the city or village.\n\nSourceLaws 1879, § 69, XXIV, p. 215;Laws 1881, c. 23, § 8, XXIV, p. 183;Laws 1885, c. 20, § 1, XXIV, p. 174;Laws 1887, c. 12, § 1, XXIV, p. 303;R.S.1913, § 5129;C.S.1922, § 4304;C.S.1929, § 17-453;R.S.1943, § 17-555;Laws 1994, LB 695, § 6;Laws 2015, LB266, § 11;Laws 2015, LB361, § 33;Laws 2016, LB703, § 2;Laws 2017, LB133, § 179.\n\nAnnotations\n\nCity could not authorize use of part of street for private garage purposes.
