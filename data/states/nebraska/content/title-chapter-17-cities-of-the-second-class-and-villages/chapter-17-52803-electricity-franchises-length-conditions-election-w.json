Such franchise may run for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, and it may be granted to any person, company, or association, whether publicly or privately owned, and to his, her, or its assigns. Such franchise may permit the person, company, or association to erect and maintain poles, lines, wires, and conductors for electricity in the streets, lanes, alleys, and public places of such city or village and for furnishing electricity to the inhabitants of such city or village.

Such city or village may levy a tax for the purpose of paying the cost of such lighting of streets, lanes, alleys, or public places of such city or village or to pay the rent under such lease. No public service company, whether publicly or privately owned, shall sell to any city of the second class or village, generating its own electric energy for all or a major portion of its electric requirements, unless first authorized so to do by a vote of the electors of such city or village, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as are set forth in section 18-412.
