      "text": "17-509.Streets and malls; power to improve; districts.\n\nThe governing body of any city of the second class or village may grade, partially or to an established grade, change grade, curb, recurb, gutter, regutter, pave, gravel, regravel, macadamize, remacadamize, widen or narrow streets or roadways, resurface or relay existing pavement, or otherwise improve any streets, alleys, public grounds, public ways, entirely or partially, and streets which divide the city or village corporate limits and the area adjoining the city or village; construct or reconstruct pedestrian walks, plazas, malls, landscaping, outdoor sprinkler systems, fountains, decorative water ponds, lighting systems, and permanent facilities; and construct sidewalks and improve the sidewalk space. These projects may be funded at public cost or by the levy of special assessments on the property especially benefited in proportion to such benefits, except as provided in sections 19-2428 to 19-2431. The governing body may by ordinance create improvement districts, to be consecutively numbered, which may include two or more connecting or intersecting streets, alleys, or public ways, and may include two or more types of improvements authorized under this section in a single district in one proceeding. All of the improvements which are to be funded by a levy of special assessment on the property especially benefited shall be ordered as provided in sections 17-510 to 17-512, unless the governing body improves a street which divides the city or village corporate area and the area adjoining the city or village. Whenever the governing body of any city of the second class or village improves any street which divides the city or village corporate limits and the area adjoining the city or village, the governing body shall determine the sufficiency of petition as set forth in section 17-510 by the owners of the record title representing more than sixty percent of the front footage of the property directly abutting upon the street to be improved, rather than sixty percent of the resident owners. Whenever the governing body shall deem it necessary to make any of the improvements authorized under this section on a street which divides the city or village corporate limits and the area adjoining the city or village, the governing body shall by ordinance create the improvement district pursuant to section 17-511 and the right of remonstrance shall be limited to owners of record title, rather than resident owners.\n\nSourceLaws 1879, § 69, IV, p. 211;Laws 1881, c. 23, § 8, IV, p. 173;Laws 1885, c. 20, § 1, IV, p. 163;Laws 1887, c. 12, § 7, IV, p. 292;Laws 1903, c. 20, § 1, IV, p. 163;Laws 1909, c. 22, § 1, p. 191;Laws 1911, c. 21, § 1, p. 138;R.S.1913, § 5110;Laws 1915, c. 92, § 1, p. 232;Laws 1917, c. 102, § 1, p. 267;Laws 1919, c. 50, § 1, p. 144;C.S.1922, § 4283;Laws 1923, c. 135, § 1, p. 300;Laws 1927, c. 42, § 1, p. 176;C.S.1929, § 17-432;Laws 1933, c. 136, § 20, p. 529;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 17-432;R.S.1943, § 17-509;Laws 1969, c. 92, § 1, p. 456;Laws 1979, LB 136, § 3;Laws 1983, LB 94, § 2;Laws 1995, LB 196, § 2;Laws 2017, LB133, § 127.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.

City of McCook v. Red Willow County, 133 Neb. 380, 275 N.W. 396 (1937).\n\nWhere statute authorizes city to pave streets but contains nothing to contrary, there arises an implication that the city is authorized to enter into contracts for the performance of the work and to pay for same by a general tax levy.

Special assessments\n\nSpecial assessments are levied on basis of benefits accruing to property and not on basis of cost of improvement immediately in front of property. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. v. City of Seward, 166 Neb. 662, 90 N.W.2d 282 (1958).\n\nLegislative power to make special assessments is to be strictly construed. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. v.

Musser v. Village of Rushville, 122 Neb. 128, 239 N.W. 642 (1931).\n\nResolution of necessity is not jurisdictional, nor is the establishment of grade by ordinance required before letting of paving contract.

Greenwood Cemetery v. City of Wayne, 110 Neb. 300, 193 N.W. 734 (1923).\n\nIf board, in levying assessments to pay for sidewalks, does not take the benefits and damages resulting to the property into account and levies the total cost without regards thereto, the tax is void.

Alexander v. Bailey, 108 Neb. 717, 189 N.W. 365 (1922).",
