South Sioux City v. Hanchett Bond Co., 19 F.2d 476 (8th Cir. 1927).\n\nFindings of a board, authorized by the Legislature to determine questions of fact upon which limitations of amount of issue of bonds depends, are conclusive in favor of bona fide purchasers of such bonds. Chilton v. Town of Gratton, 82 F. 873 (Cir. Ct., D. Neb. 1897).",
