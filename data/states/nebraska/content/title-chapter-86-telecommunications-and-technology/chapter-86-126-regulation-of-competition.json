The commission may revoke any waivers it grants or reinstate regulations if such revocation or reinstatement would protect the public interest upon a finding that the telecommunications company is restricting market output, impairing customer interest, or engaging in unlawful anticompetitive activity.\n\nSourceLaws 1986, LB 835, § 7;R.S.1943, (1999), § 86-807;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 26.",
