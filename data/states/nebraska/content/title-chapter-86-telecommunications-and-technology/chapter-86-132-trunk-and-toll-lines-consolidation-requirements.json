During the period intervening between the time when the first subscribers are taken from the eliminated exchange until the time all have been removed, if such period is more than thirty days, a temporary trunk line shall be established between the two exchanges so that calls may come into both exchanges from the trunk or toll lines of the exchange so absorbed or eliminated and that calls from both exchanges may go out over the lines.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 425, art.
