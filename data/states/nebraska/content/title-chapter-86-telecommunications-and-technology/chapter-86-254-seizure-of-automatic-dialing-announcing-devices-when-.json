The commission may, upon finding that the owner of a seized device has willfully or intentionally failed to comply with the applicable law, rules, or regulations, confiscate the device. Any device so confiscated may be destroyed. Destruction of a device shall not occur before all statutory appeal periods available to the owner have been exhausted. The seizure and destruction of an automatic dialing-announcing device shall not relieve any person from a fine, imprisonment, or other penalty for violation of the applicable law, rules, or regulations. The commission, its agents and employees, or any peace officer of this state shall not be liable for negligence for the seizure, confiscation, or destruction of any contraband pursuant to this section.\n\nSourceLaws 1993, LB 305, § 18;R.S.1943, (1999), § 86-1218;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 116.",
