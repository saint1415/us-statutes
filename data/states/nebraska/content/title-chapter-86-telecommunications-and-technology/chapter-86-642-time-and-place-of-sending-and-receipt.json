For purposes of this subsection, the following rules apply:\n\n(a) If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction; and\n\n(b) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as the case may be.\n\n(5) An electronic record is received under subsection (2) of this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.\n\n(6) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (2) of this section establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.\n\n(7) If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under subsection (1) of this section, or purportedly received under subsection (2) of this section, was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law. Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 929, § 15;R.S.Supp.,2000, § 86-2115;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 404.",
