Such telecommunications company shall also take calls from its subscribers and public pay stations and pass such calls through its exchange toward destination and over the lines and the route designated by the person making such telephone call if there are competing lines existing between such points. If the person making such telephone call does not designate a route for such message or no competing lines exist between points of origination and destination, the telecommunications company may, by its operator at originating point, make such designation of route, but calls or messages shall be switched through to destination if the point can be reached by any connecting equipment.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 425, art.
