The ability to move information quickly and accurately through electronic means is critical to the success of education, business, agriculture, health care, government, libraries, communities, and other areas of interest in a global society. A statewide vision and strategy is needed to ensure coordinated development of the telecommunications infrastructure necessary for Nebraska to keep pace worldwide and collaboration among entities within the state and with other states.\n\nSourceLaws 1998, LB 924, § 1;R.S.1943, (1999), § 86-1501;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 282.",
