It is further the intent of the Legislature that the residents of this state should have access to broadband telecommunications service at a minimum download speed of one hundred megabits per second and a minimum upload speed of one hundred megabits per second.\n\nThis section terminates on July 1, 2026.\n\nSourceLaws 2018, LB994, § 1;Laws 2024, LB1031, § 14;Laws 2025, LB346, § 68.Operative Date: September 3, 2025",
