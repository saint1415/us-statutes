Such council would help facilitate acquisition of such technology at all levels of government and make recommendations to the Legislature for program initiatives and funding and the fostering of communication, training, and education.\n\n(3) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Geographic Information Systems Council serve as an advisory council to the Nebraska Information Technology Commission and assist the commission in its overall information technology planning and oversight and provide technical advice and recommendations related to the specialized needs of Geographic Information Systems.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 639, § 1;R.S.1943, (1999), § 81-2601;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 339;Laws 2008, LB823, § 17.",
