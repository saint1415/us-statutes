The officer may require such information from the agency as necessary to determine that the proposed change in design is cost effective and technically feasible, that funding is available, and that the proposed schedule for implementation is reasonable and feasible;(c) May contract with other governmental entities or private vendors in carrying out the duties relating to the intergovernmental data services program;(d) Shall establish a rate schedule that reflects the rates adopted by the division of communications and the information management services division, plus any additional costs of the system. Such fees may reflect a base cost for access to the system, costs for actual usage of the system, costs for special equipment or services, or a combination of these factors. The officer may charge for the costs of changes to the system that are requested by or are necessary to accommodate a request by a user. All fees shall be set to recover all costs of operation;(e) May enter into agreements with other state and local governments, the federal government, or private-sector entities for the purpose of sale, lease, or licensing for third-party resale of applications and system design;(f) Shall determine whether a local application shall be a component of the system.
