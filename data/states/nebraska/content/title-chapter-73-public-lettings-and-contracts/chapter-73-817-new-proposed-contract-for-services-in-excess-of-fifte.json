If the contract did not produce the expected cost savings, the state agency shall receive certification from the division prior to entering into another contract in excess of fifteen million dollars for the same services.\n\nSourceLaws 2012, LB858, § 13;Laws 2013, LB563, § 1;R.S.1943, (2018), § 73-510;Laws 2024, LB461, § 17.",
