Such conditions necessitated the relocation of female youth from the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center-Geneva due to living conditions posing a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the female youth residing at the facility under court order. The Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature found, through a series of public hearings and comments during the 2019 interim, that there was a breakdown in the day-to-day operations of the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center-Geneva, including (1) disrepair of the facilities making them uninhabitable, (2) inadequate staffing, (3) a lack of proper behavioral or mental health services and treatment programming, and (4) a lack of health care, including, but not limited to, medication management. The Department of Health and Human Services has released a business plan to reorganize the youth rehabilitation and treatment center model in Nebraska on a condensed timeline without consultation or input from the Legislature or stakeholders with experience and expertise in youth rehabilitation and treatment. The safety, quality of life, and right to a safe treatment environment for these youth is of the utmost concern to the Legislature, and it is clear the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center-Geneva has reached a critical point in its ability to care for the female youth entrusted to its care.\n\nSourceLaws 2020, LB1144, § 3.",
