The Public Counsel shall conduct a suitable investigation into the things complained of unless the Public Counsel believes that:\n\n(a) The complainant has another remedy available which the complainant could reasonably be expected to use;\n\n(b) The grievance pertains to a matter outside the Public Counsel's power;\n\n(c) The complainant's interest is insufficiently related to the subject matter;\n\n(d) The complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith;\n\n(e) Other complaints are more worthy of attention;\n\n(f) The Public Counsel's resources are insufficient for adequate investigation; or\n\n(g) The complaint has been too long delayed to justify present examination of its merit.\n\n(2) The Public Counsel's declining to investigate a complaint shall not bar the Public Counsel from proceeding on the Public Counsel's own motion to inquire into related problems. After completing consideration of a complaint, whether or not it has been investigated, the Public Counsel shall suitably inform the complainant and the administrative agency involved.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 762, § 8, p. 2882;Laws 2020, LB1144, § 8;R.S.1943, (2024), § 81-8,247;Laws 2025, LB298, § 9.Effective Date: June 5, 2025",
