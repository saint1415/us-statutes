If the annual report criticizes any named agencies or officials, the report must also include the replies of the named agencies or officials to such criticism. Each member of the Legislature shall receive an electronic copy of such report by making a request for it to the Public Counsel.\n\n(2) On or before December 15 of each year, the Public Counsel shall submit a report electronically to the Clerk of the Legislature as required under section 83-104 regarding state institutions.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 762, § 12, p. 2883;Laws 1979, LB 322, § 45;Laws 2012, LB782, § 177;Laws 2020, LB1144, § 11;R.S.1943, (2024), § 81-8,251;Laws 2025, LB298, § 13.Effective Date: June 5, 2025",
