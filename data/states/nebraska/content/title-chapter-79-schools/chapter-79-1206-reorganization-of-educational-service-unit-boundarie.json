It is the intent of the Legislature to establish an orderly process for locally initiated reorganization of educational service unit boundaries. The purpose of sections 79-1206 to 79-1211 is to establish the statutory framework for such process and to empower the State Board of Education to make changes in educational service unit boundaries based on statutory criteria.\n\nSourceLaws 1987, LB 688, § 2;R.S.1943, (1994), § 79-2202.03;Laws 1996, LB 900, § 923.",
