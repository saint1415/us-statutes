Nor does it require parents to enroll their child in a legally recognized school until they obtain the State's recognition of an exempt homeschool. State v. Thacker, 286 Neb. 16, 834 N.W.2d 597 (2013).\n\nUnder subsection (2) of this section, an exempt school's ability to complete the minimum instruction hours is the only timing requirement imposed upon an exempt school's calendar year. State v. Thacker, 286 Neb. 16, 834 N.W.2d 597 (2013).\n\nWhere a juvenile is adjudicated solely on the basis of habitual truancy from school under subdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247 and the status of truancy is subsequently terminated by the lawful execution of a parental release authorizing discontinuation of school pursuant to subdivision (3)(d) of this section, a juvenile court may terminate its jurisdiction without a finding that such termination is in the best interests of the juvenile. In re Interest of Kevin K., 274 Neb. 678, 742 N.W.2d 767 (2007).\n\nThe state, having a high responsibility for the education of its citizens, has the power to impose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education. Parents have a right to send their children to private schools but do not have the right to be completely unfettered by reasonable government regulations as to the quality of the education furnished and the maintenance of minimum standards. State ex rel. Douglas v. Faith Baptist Church of Louisville, 207 Neb. 802, 301 N.W.2d 571 (1981).\n\nViolation of this law is not, in itself, evidence of neglect under section 43-202(2)(c), R.R.S.1943. State v. Rice, 204 Neb. 732, 285 N.W.2d 223 (1979).\n\nThis section did not operate to violate constitutional right of parents to educate their children in accordance with the tenets of their religious faith. Meyerkorth v. State, 173 Neb. 889, 115 N.W.2d 585 (1962).\n\nThis section has no application to physically or mentally handicapped child attending special school. Schutte v. Decker, 164 Neb. 582, 83 N.W.2d 69 (1957).\n\nCompulsory education statutes and juvenile code statutes regarding the neglect of children generally do not pertain to the same subject matter and should not be construed in pari materia. In re Interest of Laticia S., 21 Neb. App. 921, 844 N.W.2d 841 (2014).\n\nSubdivision (3)(a) of section 43-247 establishes the juvenile court's jurisdiction over a minor child, while this section and section 79-210 make the minor child's parents or legal guardians culpable for the child's truancy. The county attorney is free to decide whether to proceed utilizing the juvenile code or the compulsory education laws. In re Interest of Laticia S., 21 Neb. App. 921, 844 N.W.2d 841 (2014).",
