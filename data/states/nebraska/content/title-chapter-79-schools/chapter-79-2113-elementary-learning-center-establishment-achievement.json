In developing the plan, the achievement subcouncil shall seek input from community resources and collaborate with such resources in order to maximize the available opportunities and the participation of elementary students and their families. An achievement subcouncil may, as part of such plan, recommend services be provided through contracts with, or grants to, entities other than school districts to provide some or all of the services. Such entities may include collaborative groups which may include the participation of a school district. An achievement subcouncil may also, as part of such plan, recommend that the elementary learning center serve as a clearinghouse for recommending programs provided by school districts or other entities and that the elementary learning center assist students in accessing such programs. The plans for the initial elementary learning centers shall be submitted by the achievement subcouncils to the coordinating council on or before January 1 immediately following the establishment of a new learning community.\n\n(3) Each elementary learning center shall have at least one facility that is located in an area with a high concentration of poverty. Such facility may be owned or leased by the learning community, or the use of the facility may be donated to the learning community. Programs offered by the elementary learning center may be offered in such facility or in other facilities, including school buildings.\n\nSourceLaws 2007, LB641, § 45;Laws 2008, LB1154, § 23;Laws 2009, LB392, § 17;Laws 2015, LB525, § 28.",
