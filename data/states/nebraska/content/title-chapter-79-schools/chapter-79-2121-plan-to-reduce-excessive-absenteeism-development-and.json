For purposes of this section, at-risk youth means children who are under the supervision of the Office of Probation Administration, are committed to the care, custody, or supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services, are otherwise involved in the juvenile justice system, or have been absent from school for more than five days per quarter or the hourly equivalent except when excused by school authorities or when a documented illness makes attendance impossible or impracticable.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB463, § 22.",
