All courts and all administrative agencies shall take judicial notice of the Compact, the Rules of the Commission, and any information provided to a Member State pursuant thereto in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding in a Member State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact, or which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.\n\n4. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.\n\nB. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Member States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\nC. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners of the Member States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\nD. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the State Licensing Authority, and each of the Member States.\n\nE. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\nF. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.\n\nG. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nH. Dispute Resolution\n\n1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member and non-Member States.\n\n2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both binding and non-binding alternative dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\nI. Enforcement\n\n1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or State law.\n\nARTICLE XI- EFFECTUATION, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT\n\nA. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth Member State.\n\n1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the Charter Member States to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially different from the model Compact statute.\n\n2. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Article X.\n\n3. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in Article VII.C.20 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.\n\nB. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than ten.\n\nC. Any State that joins the Compact after the Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and Bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and Bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State, as the Rules and Bylaws may be amended as provided in this Compact.\n\nD. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nE. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.\n\nARTICLE XII- CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State or a State seeking membership in the compact, or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.\n\nARTICLE XIII- CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS\n\nA. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.\n\nB. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nC. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nSourceLaws 2023, LB298, § 4.",
