The limited English proficiency allowance correction shall equal the limited English proficiency allowance minus eighty-five percent of the limited English proficiency allowance expenditures. If the limited English proficiency allowance expenditures do not equal fifty percent or more of the allowance for such school fiscal year, the school district shall also be disqualified from receiving a limited English proficiency allowance for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated.\n\n(4) The department may request additional information from any school district to assist with calculations and determinations pursuant to this section. If the school district does not provide information upon the request of the department pursuant to this section, the school district shall be disqualified from receiving a limited English proficiency allowance for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated.\n\nSourceLaws 2006, LB 1024, § 82;Laws 2007, LB641, § 22;Laws 2008, LB988, § 31;Laws 2009, LB545, § 6;Laws 2011, LB18, § 4;Laws 2013, LB407, § 5;Laws 2018, LB1081, § 15;Laws 2019, LB675, § 8.",
