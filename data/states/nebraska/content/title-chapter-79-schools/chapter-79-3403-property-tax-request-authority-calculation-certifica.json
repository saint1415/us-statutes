In determining the total non-property-tax revenue for the current year, any category of non-property-tax revenue for which there is insufficient data as of June 1 to make an accurate determination shall be deemed to be equal to the prior year's amount.\n\n(3) The department shall certify the amount determined for each school district under this section to the school board of such school district. Such certified amount shall be the school district's property tax request authority.\n\nSourceLaws 2023, LB243, § 3.",
