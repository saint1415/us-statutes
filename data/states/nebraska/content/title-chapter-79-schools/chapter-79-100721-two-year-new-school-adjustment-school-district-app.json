Such form shall require evidence of recent and expected student growth, evidence that a new building or the expansion or remodeling of an existing building is being completed to provide additional student capacity to accommodate such growth and not to replace an existing building, evidence that the school fiscal year for which the district would receive the first-year adjustment will be the first full school fiscal year for which students will utilize such additional capacity, and evidence of the estimated additional student capacity to be provided by the project. On or before the immediately following December 1, the department shall approve the estimated additional capacity for use in the adjustment, approve a modified estimated additional capacity for use in the adjustment, or deny the application based on the requirements of this section, the evidence submitted on the application, and any other information provided by the department. Each approval shall include an approved estimated additional student capacity for the new building. The state board shall establish procedures for appeal of decisions of the department to the state board for final determination.\n\n(2) The first-year new school adjustment for each approved district shall equal the school district's basic funding per formula student multiplied by twenty percent of the approved estimated additional student capacity. The second-year new school adjustment for each approved district shall equal the school district's basic funding per formula student multiplied by ten percent of the approved estimated additional student capacity.\n\nSourceLaws 2008, LB988, § 23;Laws 2009, LB549, § 31.",
