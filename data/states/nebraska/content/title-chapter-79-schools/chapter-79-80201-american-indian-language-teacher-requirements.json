When developing such approval tests, the tribe shall include, but not be limited to, which dialects will be used, whether it will standardize its writing system, and how the teaching methods will be evaluated in the classroom. The teacher approval tests shall be administered at a community college or state college.\n\nSourceLaws 1999, LB 475, § 1.",
