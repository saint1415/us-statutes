The Board of Educational Lands and Funds shall proceed to investigate the facts involved in such appeal and, if the contention of the school board or learning community coordinating council is correct, make the proper reappraisement. The value calculation in this subsection shall be used by the Commissioner of Education for making distributions in each school fiscal year.\n\nSourceLaws 1881, c. 78, subdivision VIII, § 9, p. 364;R.S.1913, § 6906;Laws 1921, c. 82, § 1, p. 296;C.S.1922, § 6482;Laws 1929, c. 187, § 1, p. 651;C.S.1929, § 79-1609;Laws 1933, c. 144, § 2, p. 557;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 79-1609;Laws 1943, c. 200, § 1, p. 670;R.S.1943, § 79-1612;Laws 1947, c. 282, § 1, p. 890;Laws 1949, c. 256, § 378, p. 818;Laws 1957, c. 359, § 2, p. 1218;Laws 1979, LB 187, § 246;Laws 1982, LB 572, § 1;Laws 1983, LB 39, § 1;Laws 1990, LB 1090, § 23;Laws 1991, LB 511, § 61;Laws 1992, LB 245, § 66;Laws 1993, LB 839, § 5;Laws 1994, LB 858, § 11;R.S.1943, (1994), § 79-1303;Laws 1996, LB 900, § 682;Laws 1997, LB 270, § 104;Laws 1998, Spec.
