The board of each educational service unit may charge for a portion or all of the costs of the additional services authorized by this section. If an educational service unit on December 25, 1969, has a health service facility, this section does not prevent the continued use by the unit of such facility. The educational service unit may contract with such health department to provide school health services for that area of the educational service unit not served by such city-county, multicounty, or regional health department.\n\nSourceLaws 1965, c. 504, § 8, p. 1611;Laws 1969, c. 749, § 1, p. 2823;Laws 1969, c. 750, § 1, p. 2825;Laws 1972, LB 928, § 1;Laws 1979, LB 57, § 2;Laws 1987, LB 688, § 24;Laws 1994, LB 1310, § 15;R.S.1943, (1994), § 79-2208;Laws 1996, LB 900, § 939;Laws 1997, LB 347, § 48.",
