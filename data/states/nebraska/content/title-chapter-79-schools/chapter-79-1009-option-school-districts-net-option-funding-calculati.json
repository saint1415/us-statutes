For purposes of the calculation of aid for school fiscal year 2017-18 for school districts that are members of a learning community, net number of option students means the difference of the number of students residing in another school district who are option students or open enrollment students enrolled in the district minus the number of students residing in the district but enrolled in another district as option students or open enrollment students.\n\n(2)(a) For school fiscal years prior to school fiscal year 2023-24, net option funding shall be the product of the net number of option students multiplied by the statewide average basic funding per formula student.\n\n(b) For school fiscal year 2023-24 and each school fiscal year thereafter, net option funding shall be the product of the net number of option students multiplied by the difference of the statewide average basic funding per formula student minus the amount of foundation aid paid per formula student pursuant to section 79-1006.\n\n(3) A district's net option funding shall be zero if the calculation produces a negative result.\n\nPayments made under this section for school fiscal years prior to school fiscal year 2017-18 shall be made from the funds to be disbursed under section 79-1005.01.\n\nSuch payments shall go directly to the option school district but shall count as a formula resource for the local system.\n\nSourceLaws 1996, LB 1050, § 18;Laws 1997, LB 806, § 40;Laws 1998, Spec.
