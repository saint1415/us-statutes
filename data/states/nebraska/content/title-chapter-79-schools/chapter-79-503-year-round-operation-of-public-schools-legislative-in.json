The Legislature finds that the cost of education is substantially increased when schoolhouses sit idle for three months of the year and that the rural and pioneer conditions which dictated summer closing of public schools no longer prevail in many of the school districts of the state.\n\nSourceLaws 1973, LB 65, § 1;Laws 1993, LB 348, § 7;R.S.1943, (1994), § 79-201.01;Laws 1996, LB 900, § 256.",
