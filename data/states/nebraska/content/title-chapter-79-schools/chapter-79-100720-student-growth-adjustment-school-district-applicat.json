      "text": "79-1007.20.Student growth adjustment; school district; application; department; powers.\n\n(1) School districts may apply to the department for a student growth adjustment, on a form prescribed by the department, on or before October 15 of the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated. Such form shall require an estimate of the average daily membership for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated, the estimated student growth calculated by subtracting the fall membership of the current school fiscal year from the estimated average daily membership for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated, and evidence supporting the estimates. On or before the immediately following December 1, the department shall approve the estimated student growth, approve a modified student growth, or deny the application based on the requirements of this section, the evidence submitted on the application, and any other information provided by the department. The state board shall establish procedures for appeal of decisions of the department to the state board for final determination.\n\n(2) The student growth adjustment for each approved district shall equal the sum of the product of the school district's basic funding per formula student multiplied by the difference of the approved student growth minus the greater of twenty-five students or one percent of the fall membership for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated plus the product of fifty percent of the school district's basic funding per formula student multiplied by the greater of twenty-five students or one percent of the fall membership for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated.\n\n(3) The department shall calculate a student growth adjustment correction for each district that received a student growth adjustment for aid distributed in the most recently available complete data year. Such student growth correction shall equal the product of the difference of the actual student growth for such school fiscal year minus the estimated student growth for such school fiscal year used to calculate the student growth adjustment for such school fiscal year multiplied by the school district's basic funding per formula student used in the final calculation of aid pursuant to section 79-1065 for such school fiscal year, except that the absolute value of a negative correction shall not exceed the original adjustment.\n\nSourceLaws 2008, LB988, § 22;Laws 2009, LB549, § 30;Laws 2013, LB410, § 9;Laws 2014, LB725, § 1.",
