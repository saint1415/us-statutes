On or at any time after such application the court may, in its discretion, issue an order restraining such pharmacy or its agents or employees from the performance of unauthorized acts. After a hearing the court shall either grant or deny the application. Such order shall continue until the court, after a hearing, finds the basis for such order has been removed.\n\nSourceLaws 2007, LB236, § 36;R.S.Supp.,2007, § 71-1,147.70;Laws 2007, LB247, § 84;Laws 2015, LB37, § 53.",
