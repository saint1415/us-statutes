After satisfactory completion of the period of supervised practice as determined by the board, the reentry licensee may apply to the department to convert the reentry license to a license issued under section 38-2026.\n\n(4) After an assessment and the completion of any educational program that has been prescribed, if the board determines that the applicant is competent and qualified to practice medicine without supervision, the department, with the recommendation of the board, may convert the reentry license to a license issued under section 38-2026.\n\n(5) A reentry license shall be valid for one year and may be renewed for up to two additional years if approved by the department, with the recommendation of the board.\n\n(6) The issuance of a reentry license shall not constitute a disciplinary action.\n\nSourceLaws 2011, LB406, § 3.",
