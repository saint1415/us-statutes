A temporary license shall not be issued to any person who fails to pass the examination if such person did not hold a valid temporary license prior to the failure to pass the examination.\n\n(2) This section shall not apply to a temporary license issued as provided under section 38-129.01.\n\nSourceLaws 2023, LB227, § 47.",
