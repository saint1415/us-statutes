      "text": "38-3801.EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact.\n\nThe State of Nebraska adopts the EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact in the form substantially as follows:\n\nARTICLE 1. PURPOSE\n\nIn order to protect the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability for patient-care-related activities, all states license emergency medical services personnel, such as emergency medical technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians, and paramedics. The EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact is intended to facilitate the day-to-day movement of emergency medical services personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their emergency medical services duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state emergency medical services offices to afford immediate legal recognition to emergency medical services personnel licensed in a member state. This compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of emergency medical services personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:\n\n1. Increase public access to emergency medical services personnel;\n\n2. Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially patient safety;\n\n3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in the areas of emergency medical services personnel licensure and regulation;\n\n4. Support licensing of military members who are separating from an active duty tour and their spouses;\n\n5. Facilitate the exchange of information between member states regarding emergency medical services personnel licensure, adverse action, and significant investigatory information;\n\n6. Promote compliance with the laws governing emergency medical services personnel practice in each member state; and\n\n7.

A home state's state EMS authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported conduct in a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In such cases, the home state's law shall control in determining the appropriate adverse action.\n\nG. Nothing in the EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact shall override a member state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the member state's laws.

Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;\n\n3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or\n\n4. Protect public health and safety.\n\nM. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\nARTICLE 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nA. Oversight\n\n1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent. This compact and the rules promulgated under this compact shall have standing as statutory law.\n\n2. All courts shall take judicial notice of this compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission.\n\n3. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nB. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination\n\n1. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature or the speaker if no such leaders exist, and each of the member states.\n\n4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.

Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of this compact.\n\nB. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.

Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with this compact.\n\nE. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.\n\nARTICLE 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThe EMS Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.\n\nSourceLaws 2018, LB1034, § 69.\n\nCross ReferencesEmergency Management Assistance Compact, see section 1-124, Appendix, Nebraska Revised Statutes, Volume 2A.",
