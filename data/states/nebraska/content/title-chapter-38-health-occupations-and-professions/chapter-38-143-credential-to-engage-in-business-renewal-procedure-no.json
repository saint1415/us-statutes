If a credentialed business fails to meet the renewal requirements on or before the date of expiration of the credential, the credential shall expire. When a credential expires, the right to operate the business shall terminate. A business which fails to renew its credential by the expiration date shall apply for and obtain another credential prior to operating the business.\n\nSourceLaws 2003, LB 242, § 15;Laws 2004, LB 906, § 1;Laws 2004, LB 1005, § 9;R.S.Supp.,2006, § 71-110.01;Laws 2007, LB463, § 43.",
