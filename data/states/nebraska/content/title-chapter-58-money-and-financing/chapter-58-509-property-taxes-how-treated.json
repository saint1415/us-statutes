In each year for which the current assessed valuation on taxable real property and taxable personal property in the redevelopment project exceeds the redevelopment project valuation, the county treasurer shall remit to the contracting public body, instead of to any taxing body, that proportion of all property taxes on real property and personal property paid that year on the redevelopment project which such excess valuation bears to the current assessed valuation.\n\nSourceLaws 1995, LB 830, § 9.",
