      "text": "58-702.Legislative findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds that current economic conditions, lack of available affordable housing, federal housing policies that have placed an increasing burden on the state, and declining resources at all levels of government adversely affect the ability of Nebraska's citizens to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. Lack of affordable housing also affects the ability of communities to maintain and develop viable and stable economies.\n\nFurthermore, the Legislature finds that impediments exist to the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. Local codes and state statutes have an important effect on housing's affordability by placing increased costs on developers. Financing affordable housing, especially in rural areas and smaller communities, is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, existing dilapidated housing stock and industrial buildings are detrimental to new affordable housing development and the general health and safety of people living and working in or around such places. An affordable housing trust fund would assist all Nebraska communities in financing affordable housing projects and other projects which make the community safer for residents.\n\nTo enhance the economic development of the state and to provide for the general prosperity of all of Nebraska's citizens, it is in the public interest to assist in the provision of safe, decent, and affordable housing in all areas of the state. The establishment of the Nebraska Affordable Housing Act will assist in creating conditions favorable to meeting the affordable housing needs of the state.\n\nSourceLaws 1996, LB 1322, § 12;Laws 2011, LB388, § 10.",
