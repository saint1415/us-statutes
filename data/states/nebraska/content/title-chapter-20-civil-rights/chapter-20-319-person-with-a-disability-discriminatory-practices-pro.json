and\n\n(c) In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after September 1, 1991, a failure to design and construct the dwellings in such a manner that:\n\n(i) The public use and common use portions of the dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by people with disabilities;\n\n(ii) All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within the dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by people using wheelchairs;

and\n\n(b) Ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units.\n\n(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate or limit any law of a political subdivision or other jurisdiction in which this section is effective that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords people with disabilities greater access than is required by this section.\n\n(8) Nothing in this section shall require that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 825, § 20;Laws 1998, LB 1073, § 5;Laws 2021, LB540, § 20.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe plaintiff offered no evidence that a fence was necessary to afford her daughter an equal opportunity to use and enjoy her home. The court found the plaintiff had no right to her preferred means of accommodation. The court found no evidence the proposed alternatives would not be effective, which included using underground invisible fencing, a privacy fence around the plaintiff's patio, or tethering animals while outside.
