Any relief so granted that would accrue to an aggrieved person in such a civil action shall also accrue to that aggrieved person in a civil action under this section. If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of an aggrieved person who does not intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if that aggrieved person has not complied with discovery orders entered by the court.\n\nSourceLaws 1991, LB 825, § 41.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe 30-day limitation of this section is mandatory and not directory.
