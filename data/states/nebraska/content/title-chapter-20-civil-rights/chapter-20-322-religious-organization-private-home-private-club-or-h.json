In determining whether housing qualifies as housing for older persons under this subdivision, the commission shall develop regulations which require at least the following factors:\n\n(A) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons or, if the provision of such facilities and services is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons;\n\n(B) That at least eighty percent of the units are occupied by at least one person fifty-five years of age or older per unit; and\n\n(C) The publication of and adherence to policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons fifty-five years of age or older.\n\n(c) Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of:\n\n(i) Persons residing in the housing as of September 6, 1991, who do not meet the age requirements of subdivision (b)(ii) or (iii) of this subsection if succeeding occupants of the housing meet the age requirements; or\n\n(ii) Unoccupied units if the units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements.\n\n(5) Nothing in the act shall prohibit conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined in section 28-401.\n\n(6) Nothing in the act shall prohibit otherwise nondiscriminatory conduct intended to benefit veterans or servicemembers or their family members, such as providing housing limited to veterans or servicemembers or their family members, providing favorable conditions of loans, leases, mortgages, or contracts, or otherwise offering benefits that are limited to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.\n\nSourceLaws 1969, c. 120, § 6, p. 542;Laws 1979, LB 80, § 67;R.S.1943, (1987), § 20-110;Laws 1991, LB 825, § 23;Laws 2021, LB540, § 23;Laws 2025, LB150, § 16.Operative Date: September 3, 2025",
