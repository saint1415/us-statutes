The appraisers shall consider in the case of fall-seeded grain crops the cost of seed-bed preparation, fertilization, seed and seeding.\n\n(3) In the case of perennial crops such as alfalfa the appraisers shall consider the costs of establishing such crop, its condition as of the expiration of the lease and normal expected remaining life.\n\nSourceLaws 1967, c. 467, § 9, p. 1454;Laws 1971, LB 413, § 9.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIn determining value of permitted improvements made by lessee of school lands, the value of the land means that amount of money that the improvement enhances, contributes, increases, or adds to the value of the land. Pettijohn v. State Board of Educational Lands and Funds, 204 Neb. 271, 281 N.W.2d 901 (1979).\n\nLessee's value in a growing crop is more than the cost of seed, preparation, and planting. Friehe v.
