The purpose of the Niobrara Scenic River Act is to effectuate changes in the council necessary to ensure the continuation of the cooperative management relationship between the Niobrara Council and the National Park Service so that local participation and control over this valuable natural resource can be maintained.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 1234, § 1;Laws 2002, LB 1003, § 42.",
