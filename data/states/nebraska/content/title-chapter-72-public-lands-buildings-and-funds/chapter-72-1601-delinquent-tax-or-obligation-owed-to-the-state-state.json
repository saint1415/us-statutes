When such statement is filed, the director shall withhold an amount, not exceeding the amount of the statement, from any debt then owing by the State of Nebraska to such person and by warrant or other order shall direct the State Treasurer to credit the amount so withheld to the proper fund. If the amount so withheld is not sufficient to satisfy the statement in full, successive statements may be filed with the director whenever the State of Nebraska becomes further indebted to such person. The withholding referred to in this section shall apply solely to money owing by the state.\n\nSourceLaws 1959, c. 378, § 1, p. 1318;R.S.1943, (1986), § 77-2418;Laws 1989, LB 13, § 3.\n\nCross ReferencesTuition assistance program for Nebraska National Guard members, repayment provisions, see section 85-505.01.",
