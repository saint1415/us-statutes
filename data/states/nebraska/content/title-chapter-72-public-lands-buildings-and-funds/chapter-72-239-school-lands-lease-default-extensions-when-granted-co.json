Such extensions shall be granted, upon proper application to the board, and then only to the record owner of the lease who actually uses or occupies educational lands, for periods of one year, and shall bear interest the same as other delinquent rentals, and shall be upon condition the lease is assigned to the state as part assurance of payment. In the event the movable improvements on the land do not constitute sufficient security to justify an extension of time, the lessee may give a lien to the state on the growing crops thereon, if any.\n\nSourceLaws 1935, c. 163, § 12, p. 605;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 72-219;R.S.1943, § 72-239;Laws 1999, LB 779, § 31.\n\nAnnotations\n\nSchool lands are subject to an annual rental of six percent of the appraised value.
