The director may reserve, in the best interest of the state, an easement, license, or other interest in the building or land for the state in such sale, lease, or disposal. The director may also trade the building or land for other property needed by the state. The director may, at the expense of the state agency formerly responsible for the building or land, remove or order the agency to remove any movable property not attached to the building or land.\n\nSourceLaws 1988, LB 1143, § 4;Laws 1990, LB 830, § 4;Laws 1992, LB 1241, § 9.",
