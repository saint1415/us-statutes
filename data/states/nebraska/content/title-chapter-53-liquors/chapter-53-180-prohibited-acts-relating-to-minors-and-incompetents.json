Wilson, 238 Neb. 217, 469 N.W.2d 749 (1991).\n\nThis section does not create a duty toward third parties, and, as such, it does not fix a standard of care, the violation of which could be proof of negligence in actions by third parties. Pelzek v. American Legion, 236 Neb. 608, 463 N.W.2d 321 (1990).\n\nIn procuring liquor for a minor, which does not involve a specific criminal intent, the general criminal intent is supplied by the performance of the proscribed act. State v. Lesiak, 234 Neb. 163, 449 N.W.2d 550 (1989).\n\nThis section does not create a duty toward third parties and, therefore, the statute does not fix a standard of care, the violation of which could be proof of negligence in actions by third parties. Schroer v. Synowiecki, 231 Neb. 168, 435 N.W.2d 875 (1989).\n\nRequisite intent may be inferred from defendant's acts and surrounding circumstances, so evidence was sufficient to support conviction.

State, 132 Neb. 535, 272 N.W. 547 (1937).\n\nProcuring alcoholic liquor for a minor is a general intent crime, and there is sufficient evidence to convict a defendant even when he or she did not intend for a minor to obtain the alcohol which the defendant purchased. State v. Butzke, 7 Neb. App. 360, 584 N.W.2d 449 (1998).",
