The Legislature recognizes that the creation of farm wineries will stimulate the creation of jobs and investments in small communities, encourage the use of lands upon which grapes and other wine-related crops may be grown, and provide tax revenue which would not otherwise be realized.\n\nSourceLaws 1985, LB 279, § 1;Laws 2003, LB 536, § 1.",
