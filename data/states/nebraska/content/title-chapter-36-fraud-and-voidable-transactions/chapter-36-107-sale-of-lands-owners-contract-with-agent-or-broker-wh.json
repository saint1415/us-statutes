Actions on contract\n\nA contract for payment of a real estate commission is analogous to a contract for the sale of real estate, inasmuch as the same equitable principles govern both types of contracts in relation to the statute of frauds. Weiner v. Hazer, 230 Neb. 53, 430 N.W.2d 269 (1988).\n\nEquitable enforcement of a brokerage contract, otherwise unenforceable due to this section, is available when the contract has been fully performed by one party and nonfulfillment of the contract would amount to a fraud on that party. Weiner v. Hazer, 230 Neb. 53, 430 N.W.2d 269 (1988).\n\nWhile certain contracts are declared \"void\" under this section, such contracts are not void but are merely unenforceable for want of evidence which the statute requires. Weiner v. Hazer, 230 Neb. 53, 430 N.W.2d 269 (1988).\n\nBroker withholding from principal material facts cannot recover commission. Pearlman v.

Gress, 74 Neb. 409, 104 N.W. 758 (1905); Blair v. Austin, 71 Neb. 401, 98 N.W. 1040 (1904).\n\nAgent may recover for breach of contract where agency is exclusive though commission was not earned. Hallstead v. Perrigo, 87 Neb. 128, 126 N.W. 1078 (1910).\n\nWhere agency contract to sell land is oral, recovery cannot be had under quantum meruit on basis of time expended or reasonable value of services. Nelson v. Webster, 83 Neb. 169, 119 N.W. 256 (1909); Barney v. Lasbury, 76 Neb. 701, 107 N.W. 989 (1906).\n\nAgent, to recover, must show written contract, subscribed by parties, and setting forth his compensation. Tracy v.

Unof. 530, 92 N.W. 156 (1902).\n\nThis section does not preclude recovery under an oral agreement for sales commission where broker has fully performed under the oral agreement. Kaus v. Bideaux, 709 F.2d 1221 (8th Cir. 1983).\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\nA joint owner of land is an \"owner\" under this section, so that a joint owner of land who falsely represents sole ownership may not avoid full payment of a broker's commission. Marathon Realty Corp. v. Gavin, 224 Neb. 458, 398 N.W.2d 689 (1987).\n\nA promissory note given by a vendor to a real estate broker and accepted by the broker in payment for a commission is enforceable even if there was no written sales contract between the vendor and the broker. Peterson & Vogt v. Livingston, 206 Neb. 753, 295 N.W.2d 106 (1980).\n\nA real estate broker becomes the agent of the property owner, and owes the fiduciary duties incident thereto, from the moment the parties orally agree to the listing of the property.

Town & Country Realty of Lincoln, Inc., 194 Neb. 308, 231 N.W.2d 496 (1975).\n\nWhere party enters into contract as vendor to sell land, he cannot be heard to say that he had no interest in the lands when sued for broker's commission.

Wood, 106 Neb. 272, 183 N.W. 363 (1921).\n\nSection is constitutional. Baker v. Gillan, 68 Neb. 368, 94 N.W. 615 (1903).",
