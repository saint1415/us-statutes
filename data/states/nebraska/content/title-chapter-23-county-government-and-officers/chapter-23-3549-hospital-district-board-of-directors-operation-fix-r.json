Such hospitals shall not contract to care for indigent county patients at below the cost for care. In fixing the rates the board shall, insofar as possible, establish such rates as will permit the hospital to be operated upon a self-supporting basis. The board may establish different rates for residents of the district than for persons who do not reside within the district. Minimum standards of operation as prescribed in sections 23-3528 to 23-3552 shall be established and enforced by the board of directors.\n\nSourceLaws 1959, c. 83, § 21, p. 382;R.S.1943, (1987), § 23-343.40.",
