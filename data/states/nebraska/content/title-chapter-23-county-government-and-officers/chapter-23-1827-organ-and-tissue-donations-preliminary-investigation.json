      "text": "23-1827.Organ and tissue donations; preliminary investigation; access to information; release of organs or tissues; exception; presence for removal procedure.\n\n(1) A coroner shall conduct a preliminary investigation of a decedent within the coroner's jurisdiction as soon as possible after notification by the hospital in which such decedent is located or the hospital to which such decedent is being transported. The coroner may designate the coroner's physician or another physician to conduct the preliminary investigation.\n\n(2) The preliminary investigation shall be completed within a time period that is compatible with the preservation and recovery of organs or tissues for the purpose of transplantation.\n\n(3) The coroner may request and shall have access to all necessary information including copies of medical records, laboratory test results, X-rays, and other diagnostic results. The information shall be provided as expeditiously as possible, through reasonable means, to permit the preliminary investigation to be completed within a time period compatible with the preservation and recovery of organs or tissues for the purpose of transplantation.\n\n(4) Upon completion of the preliminary investigation, the coroner shall release all organs or tissues which have been donated or may yet be donated pursuant to the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act except those that the coroner reasonably believes contain evidence of the proximate cause or means of death. If the coroner reasonably believes that a specific organ or tissue contains evidence of the proximate cause or means of death and the organ or tissue is otherwise subject to recovery as a donated organ or tissue pursuant to the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, the coroner or his or her designee shall be present for the removal procedure (a) to make a final determination that allows the recovery of the organs and tissues to proceed, (b) to request a biopsy, or (c) to deny removal of such organ or tissue if the coroner determines such organ or tissue contains evidence of the proximate cause or means of death. After a preliminary investigation is completed under this section, all organs or tissues compatible for transplantation, except any organs or tissues for which the coroner has denied recovery, may be recovered pursuant to the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act.\n\nSourceLaws 2008, LB246, § 3;Laws 2010, LB1036, § 25.\n\nCross ReferencesRevised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, see section 71-4824.",
