Whenever any officer, office, department, or agency of the county government shall purchase or contract for any personal property or services contrary to the County Purchasing Act, such order or contract shall be void. The county officer or the head of such department or agency shall be personally liable for the costs of such order or contract and, if already paid for out of county funds, the amount may be recovered in the name of the county in an appropriate action.\n\nSourceLaws 1943, c. 57, § 8, p. 230;R.S.1943, § 23-324.06;R.S.1943, (1983), § 23-324.06;Laws 1985, LB 393, § 12.",
