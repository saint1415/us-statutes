The county board shall designate the particular project for which such levy shall be expended, the period of years, which shall not exceed twenty, for which the tax will be levied for such project, and the number of cents of the levy for each year thereof. The county board may designate more than one project and levy a tax pursuant to this section for each such project, concurrently or consecutively, as the case may be, if the aggregate levy in each year and the duration of each levy will not exceed the limitations specified in this subsection. Each levy for a project which is authorized by this subdivision may be imposed for such duration specified by the county board notwithstanding the contemporaneous existence or subsequent imposition of any other levy or levies for another project or projects imposed pursuant to this subdivision and notwithstanding the subsequent issuance by the county of bonded indebtedness payable from its general fund levy.\n\nSourceLaws 1879, § 25, p. 361;Laws 1887, c. 27, § 1, p. 352;Laws 1889, c. 10, § 1, p. 83;Laws 1909, c. 20, § 1, p. 210;R.S.1913, § 954;Laws 1915, c. 18, § 1, p. 75;Laws 1919, c. 66, § 1, p. 175;Laws 1919, c. 67, § 1, p. 178;Laws 1921, c. 144, § 1, p. 615;C.S.1922, § 854;C.S.1929, § 26-108;Laws 1935, c. 107, § 7, p. 345;Laws 1939, c. 28, § 8, p. 148;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 26-108;R.S.1943, § 23-120;Laws 1951, c. 46, § 1, p. 162;Laws 1953, c. 287, § 38, p. 952;Laws 1967, c. 119, § 1, p. 380;Laws 1969, c. 147, § 1, p. 704;Laws 1971, LB 999, § 1;Laws 1975, LB 97, § 5;Laws 1979, LB 187, § 94;Laws 1984, LB 683, § 1;Laws 1986, LB 811, § 9;Laws 1988, LB 853, § 1;Laws 1992, LB 719A, § 94;Laws 1995, LB 286, § 1;Laws 1996, LB 1114, § 37;Laws 1999, LB 272, § 4;Laws 2009, LB294, § 1.\n\nAnnotations\n\n1.
