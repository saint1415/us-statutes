Such board shall examine and audit all charges and claims against the town and the compensation of all town officers. In case of the absence of any of such officers or their failure to attend any meeting of the board, the two attending may appoint any qualified elector to act with them in the place of the absentee, and the appointee shall act, only for such meeting, in the place of such absentee as a member of such board.

At its expense, the county board may require an audit of the accounts of any township within the county, whenever in its judgment such audit is necessary. The county board may contract with the Auditor of Public Accounts or select a licensed public accountant or certified public accountant or firm of such accountants to conduct the audit. The original copy of the audit shall be filed in the office of the Auditor of Public Accounts.\n\nSourceLaws 1895, c. 28, § 51, p. 145;Laws 1913, c. 54, § 2, p. 161;R.S.1913, § 1036;C.S.1922, § 938;C.S.1929, § 26-252;R.S.1943, § 23-252;Laws 1951, c. 49, § 4, p. 167;Laws 1969, c. 153, § 3, p. 720;Laws 1973, LB 75, § 11;Laws 1985, Second Spec.
