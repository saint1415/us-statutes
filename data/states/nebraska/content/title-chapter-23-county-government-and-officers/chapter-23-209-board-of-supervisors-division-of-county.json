The board of supervisors shall divide the county into townships of sufficient population and territory to provide a workable township organization.\n\nSourceLaws 1895, c. 28, § 9, p. 134;R.S.1913, § 995;C.S.1922, § 895;C.S.1929, § 26-209;R.S.1943, § 23-209;Laws 1969, c. 152, § 1, p. 718.\n\nAnnotations\n\nBecause a township is created by a county from the territory of the county, a county is higher than a township in the hierarchy of political subdivisions in Nebraska.
