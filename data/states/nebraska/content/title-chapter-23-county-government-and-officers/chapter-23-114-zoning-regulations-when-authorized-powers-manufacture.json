If a zoning resolution or regulation affects the Niobrara scenic river corridor as defined in section 72-2006, the Niobrara Council shall act on the measure as provided in section 72-2010.\n\n(3)(a) The county board shall not adopt or enforce any zoning resolution or regulation which prohibits the use of land for a proposed residential structure for the sole reason that the proposed structure is a manufactured home if such manufactured home bears an appropriate seal which indicates that it was constructed in accordance with the standards of the Uniform Standard Code for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles, the Nebraska Uniform Standards for Modular Housing Units Act, or the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The county board may require that a manufactured home be located and installed according to the same standards for foundation system, permanent utility connections, setback, and minimum square footage which would apply to a site-built, single-family dwelling on the same lot. The county board may also require that manufactured homes meet the following standards:\n\n(i) The home shall have no less than nine hundred square feet of floor area;\n\n(ii) The home shall have no less than an eighteen-foot exterior width;\n\n(iii) The roof shall be pitched with a minimum vertical rise of two and one-half inches for each twelve inches of horizontal run;\n\n(iv) The exterior material shall be of a color, material, and scale comparable with those existing in residential site-built, single-family construction;\n\n(v) The home shall have a nonreflective roof material which is or simulates asphalt or wood shingles, tile, or rock; and\n\n(vi) The home shall have wheels, axles, transporting lights, and removable towing apparatus removed.\n\n(b) The county board may not require additional standards unless such standards are uniformly applied to all single-family dwellings in the zoning district.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to supersede any valid restrictive covenants of record.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, manufactured home shall mean (a) a factory-built structure which is to be used as a place for human habitation, which is not constructed or equipped with a permanent hitch or other device allowing it to be moved other than to a permanent site, which does not have permanently attached to its body or frame any wheels or axles, and which bears a label certifying that it was built in compliance with National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, 24 C.F.R. 3280 et seq., promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or (b) a modular housing unit as defined in section 71-1557 bearing a seal in accordance with the Nebraska Uniform Standards for Modular Housing Units Act.\n\n(5) Special districts or zones may be established in those areas subject to seasonal or periodic flooding, and such regulations may be applied as will minimize danger to life and property.\n\n(6) The powers conferred by this section shall not be exercised within the limits of any incorporated city or village nor within the area over which a city or village has been granted or ceded zoning jurisdiction and is exercising such jurisdiction. At such time as a city or village exercises control over an unincorporated area by the adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance, the ordinance or amendment shall supersede any resolution or regulation of the county.\n\nSourceLaws 1941, c. 48, § 2, p. 237;C.S.Supp.,1941, § 26-105;Laws 1943, c. 57, § 1(10), p. 226;R.S.1943, § 23-114;Laws 1957, c. 381, § 1, p. 1325;Laws 1967, c. 117, § 1, p. 366;Laws 1994, LB 511, § 4;Laws 1996, LB 1044, § 57;Laws 1998, LB 1073, § 6;Laws 1999, LB 822, § 4;Laws 2000, LB 1234, § 10;Laws 2002, LB 729, § 12;Laws 2012, LB709, § 1.\n\nCross ReferencesNebraska Uniform Standards for Modular Housing Units Act, see section 71-1555.Uniform Standard Code for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles, see section 71-4601.\n\nAnnotations\n\nIf the mode or manner by which a certain action is to be taken is prescribed in a statute or charter, that method must generally be followed.
