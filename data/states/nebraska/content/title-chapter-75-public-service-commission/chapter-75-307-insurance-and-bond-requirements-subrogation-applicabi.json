No certificate or permit shall be issued to a common or contract carrier, no license shall be issued to a motor carrier transporting household goods under section 75-304.03 or employees of a railroad carrier under section 75-304.04, nor shall such certificate, permit, or license remain in force unless such carrier complies with this section and the rules and regulations prescribed by the commission pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) The commission may, in its discretion and under its rules and regulations, require any certificated carrier, any motor carrier transporting household goods under a license issued pursuant to section 75-304.03, and any motor carrier transporting employees of a railroad carrier under a license issued pursuant to section 75-304.04 to file a surety bond, policies of insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer, or other securities or agreements, in a sum to be determined by the commission, to be conditioned upon such carrier making compensation to shippers or consignees for all property belonging to shippers or consignees and coming into the possession of such carrier in connection with its transportation service. Any carrier which may be required by law to compensate a shipper or consignee for any loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor common carrier is legally responsible shall be subrogated to the rights of such shipper or consignee under any such bond, policies of insurance, or other securities or agreements to the extent of the sum so paid.\n\n(3) In carrying out this section, the commission may classify motor carriers and regulated motor carriers taking into consideration the hazards of the operations of such carriers and the value of the household goods carried. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize the commission to compel motor carriers other than those transporting household goods under section 75-309 or under a license issued pursuant to section 75-304.03 to carry cargo insurance.\n\n(4) This section does not apply to transportation network companies.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 425, art.
