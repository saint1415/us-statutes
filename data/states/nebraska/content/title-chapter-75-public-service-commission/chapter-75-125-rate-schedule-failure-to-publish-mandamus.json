If the common carrier is a foreign corporation, then the writ may be issued by any district court in the judicial district where it accepts traffic and has an agent to perform such service to compel compliance with the provisions of section 75-124. The writ shall issue in the name of the state on the relation or upon the petition of the commission, and the failure to comply with the requirements shall be punishable as for contempt and shall make such common carrier liable to a penalty of one thousand dollars for each day's failure to comply with the writ. Whenever any such writ of mandamus is applied for, no bond shall be required.\n\nSourceLaws 1963, c. 425, art. I, § 25, p. 1363;Laws 1994, LB 414, § 40.",
