Sparks v. M&D Trucking, 301 Neb. 977, 921 N.W.2d 110 (2018).\n\nEven if the regulatory scheme governing intrastate motor carriers was applicable to common-law concepts of respondeat superior liability in a tort action, a general contractor that was a registered motor carrier, and that hired another registered motor carrier to transport construction debris, was not the statutory employer of the hired carrier or its truckdriver and, thus, could not be held vicariously liable to automobile passenger who was injured in a collision with the hired carrier's truck while the driver was under the influence of drugs; regulatory scheme contemplated a relationship between a registered motor carrier and a private truck owner or driver that was not a registered motor carrier, and did not impose an agency relationship when the independent contractor was also a registered motor carrier. Cruz v. Lopez, 301 Neb. 531, 919 N.W.2d 479 (2018).\n\nUnder the plain language of \"employee\" and \"employer,\" as used in the statutes governing intrastate motor carriers and adopting certain federal motor carrier safety regulations, a registered motor carrier that is also an employer of the drivers of its commercial motor vehicles cannot at the same time be the statutory employee of another motor carrier acting as a general contractor for a particular job. Cruz v. Lopez, 301 Neb. 531, 919 N.W.2d 479 (2018).",
