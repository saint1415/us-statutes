Jurisdiction\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\n1. Public interest factors\n\nDenial of an application for authority to provide charter service in Nebraska because such a grant would endanger or impair operations of existing carriers, contrary to the public interest, found to be appropriate. In re Application of Crusader Coach Lines, 213 Neb. 53, 327 N.W.2d 98 (1982).\n\nWhere there is evidence to sustain the factors for and against the issuance of a permit to a contract carrier, required to be considered by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, the determination of the public interest is for the commission and not the courts. Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp. v. Bankers Dispatch Corp., 188 Neb. 584, 198 N.W.2d 195 (1972).\n\nPurpose of Nebraska Motor Carrier Act was not to stifle legitimate competition but to permit it where public convenience and necessity requires. Petroleum Transport Service, Inc. v. Wheeler Transport Service, Inc., 188 Neb. 400, 197 N.W.2d 8 (1972).\n\nA permit which at best would merely allow one carrier to gain a competitive advantage over another in performing substantially the same service will not be granted. Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp. v. Bankers Dispatch Corp., 186 Neb. 261, 182 N.W.2d 648 (1971).\n\nMeaning of word necessary has been shaped by policy of act. Ready Mix, Inc. v. Nebraska Railroads, 181 Neb. 697, 150 N.W.2d 275 (1967).\n\n2. Jurisdiction\n\nThe primary consideration of Public Service Commission control is benefit to the public rather than to the individual. Ruan Transp. Corp. v. Herman Bros., Inc., 192 Neb. 343, 220 N.W.2d 245 (1974); Herman Brothers, Inc. v. Hennis Freight Lines, Inc., 192 Neb. 258, 220 N.W.2d 230 (1974).\n\nThe Nebraska Public Service Commission is without jurisdiction or authority to fix rates and charges for motor vehicle carriers transporting livestock in intrastate commerce. Livestock Carriers Div. of M. C. Assn. v. Midwest Packers Traf. Assn., 191 Neb. 1, 213 N.W.2d 443 (1973).\n\n3. Miscellaneous\n\nA litigant may not request a certificate of public convenience and necessity and in the same action and at the same time challenge the constitutionality of sections 75-301 through 75-322. In re Application of Nebraskaland Leasing & Assocs., 254 Neb. 583, 578 N.W.2d 28 (1998).\n\nCommission had right to adopt rule prohibiting tacking of certain authorities and regulating tacking of other authorities.
