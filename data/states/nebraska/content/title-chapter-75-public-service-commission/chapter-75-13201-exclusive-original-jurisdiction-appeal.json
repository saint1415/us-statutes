Any party to the case shall have the right to appeal the decision of the district court to the Court of Appeals under the rules provided by law for appeals in civil cases.\n\nSourceLaws 2000, LB 1285, § 6;Laws 2001, LB 827, § 18;Laws 2002, LB 1105, § 488;Laws 2003, LB 187, § 18;Laws 2025, LB362, § 3.Effective Date: September 3, 2025\n\nCross ReferencesAutomatic Dialing-Announcing Devices Act, see section 86-236.Intrastate Pay-Per-Call Regulation Act, see section 86-258.Nebraska Telecommunications Regulation Act, see section 86-101.Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund Act, see section 86-316.911 Service System Act, see section 86-1032.Telecommunications Relay System Act, see section 86-301.Telephone Consumer Slamming Prevention Act, see section 86-201.",
