State ex rel. Wright v. Barney, 133 Neb. 676, 276 N.W. 676 (1937).\n\nAct amendatory of unconstitutional act is invalid. City of Plattsmouth v. Murphy, 74 Neb. 749, 105 N.W. 293 (1905).\n\nRepeals by implication are not favored and such construction of a statute repealing another will not be adopted unless made necessary by evident intent of Legislature. Schafer v. Schafer, 71 Neb. 708, 99 N.W. 482 (1904); Dawson County v. Clark, 58 Neb. 756, 79 N.W. 822 (1899).\n\nWhere one section refers to another for its powers, provisions referred to become part of section and remain part thereof, although section referred to is repealed. Shull v. Barton, 58 Neb. 741, 79 N.W. 732 (1899).\n\nAbortive attempt to limit operation of existing statute does not change its force. Barker v. Potter, 55 Neb. 25, 75 N.W. 57 (1898).\n\nLegislative act, containing provision repugnant to an existing law, repeals that law by implication. State ex rel. Smythe v. Magney, 52 Neb. 508, 72 N.W. 1006 (1897).\n\nRepeal and reenactment, clearly intended to continue uninterrupted operation of old statute, will be so construed. State v. Wish, 15 Neb. 448, 19 N.W. 686 (1884).",
