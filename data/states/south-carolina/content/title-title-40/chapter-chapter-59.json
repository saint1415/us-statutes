Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, must be effective upon deposit into the United States mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the builder or contractor.

This right to cancel is in addition to any other rights of cancellation which may be found in state or federal law or regulation. See attached notice of cancellation form for an explanation of this right\"; and\n\n(2) provide each insured a fully completed form, in duplicate, prominently captioned \"NOTICE OF CANCELLATION\", which must be attached to the contract but easily detachable, and which must contain in boldface type of a minimum size of ten points the following statement:\n\n\"NOTICE OF CANCELLATION\n\nIf you are notified by your insurer that all or any part of the claim or contract is not a covered loss under the insurance policy, you may cancel the contract by mailing or delivering a signed and dated copy of this cancellation notice or any other written notice to (insert name of contractor) at (insert address of contractor's place of business) any time prior to midnight on the fifth business day after you have received such notices from your insurer.\n\nI HEREBY CANCEL THIS TRANSACTION\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSURED\"\n\n(C) In circumstances in which payment may be made from the proceeds of a property and casualty insurance policy, a builder or contractor shall not require any payments from an insured until the five-day cancellation period has expired. If, however, the builder or contractor has performed any emergency services, acknowledged by the insured in writing to be necessary to prevent damage to the premises, the builder or contractor must be entitled to collect the amount due for the emergency services at the time they are rendered. A provision in a contract as provided in subsection (A) that requires payment of any fee for anything except emergency services must not be enforceable against an insured who has canceled a contract under this section.\n\n(D)(1) A builder or contractor shall not represent or negotiate, or offer or advertise to represent or negotiate, on behalf of an owner or possessor of residential real estate on any insurance claim in connection with the repair or replacement of roof systems.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding item (1), or any other provision of state law, an owner is not prevented from consulting with a builder, contractor, or other person of his choice to provide an evaluation of the condition of his roof system and using the evaluation he receives in the negotiation for the repair or replacement of his roof system.\n\n(E)(1) A builder or contractor shall not advertise or promise to pay or rebate all or any portion of any insurance deductible as an inducement to the sale of goods or services.\n\n(2) A person who violates a provision of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor.

As used in this section, \"sale\" or \"rent\" includes an arrangement by which an owner receives compensation in money, provisions, chattel, or labor from the occupancy, or the transfer of the property or the structures on the property. This section does not exempt a person who is employed by the owner and who acts in the capacity of a builder or a specialty contractor of any kind.\n\n(C) To qualify for exemption under this section, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application.

You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own builder even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence. The building must be for your own use and occupancy. It may not be built for sale or rent. If you sell or rent a building you have built yourself within two years after the construction is complete, the law will presume that you built it for sale or rent, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your residential builder or specialty contractor. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. Your construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations.\"\n\n(D) At the time an owner personally appears and signs the building permit application as required by subsection (C) of this section, the local permitting agency shall provide the owner with all forms necessary to comply with subsection (E) of this section.\n\n(E) If a residential building or structure has been constructed by an owner under the exemption provided for in this section, the owner of the residential building or structure must promptly file as a matter of public record a notice with the register of deeds, indexed under the owner's name in the grantor's index, stating that the residential building or structure was constructed by the owner as an unlicensed builder. Failure to do so revokes the statutory exemption.\n\n(F) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to authorize an owner of a residential building or structure to hire a person or entity that is not licensed or registered in accordance with this chapter.\n\nHISTORY: 2002 Act No. 359, Section 1.",
