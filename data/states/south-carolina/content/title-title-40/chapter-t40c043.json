If no storage requirements are established for a drug, the drug may be held at \"controlled\" room temperature, as defined in an official compendium, to help ensure that its identity, strength, quality, and purity are not adversely affected. Temperature and humidity must be automatically documented by electronic recording devices. The recordkeeping requirements in subsection (I) must be followed for all stored drugs. (F) Upon receipt, each outside shipping container must be visually examined for identity and to prevent the acceptance of contaminated drugs or drugs that are otherwise unfit for distribution. This examination must be adequate to reveal container damage that would suggest possible contamination or other damage to the contents. Each outgoing shipment must be carefully inspected for identity of the drug products and to ensure that there is no delivery of drugs that has been damaged in storage or held under improper conditions.

In determining whether the conditions under which a drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, the wholesale drug distributor shall consider, among other things, the conditions under which the drug has been held, stored, or shipped before or during its return and the condition of the drug and its container, carton, or labeling, as a result of storage or shipping.

The procedure must be adequate to deal with recalls and withdrawals due to: (a) any action initiated at the request of the Food and Drug Administration or other federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agency, including the Board of Pharmacy; (b) any voluntary action by the manufacturer to remove defective or potentially defective drugs from the market; or (c) any action undertaken to promote public health and safety by the replacing of existing merchandise with an improved product or new package design; (3) a procedure to ensure that wholesale drug distributors prepare for, protect against, and handle any crisis that affects security or operation of any facility in the event of a strike, fire, flood, or other natural disaster, or other situations of local, state, or national emergency; (4) a procedure to ensure that outdated drugs are segregated from other drugs and either returned to the manufacturer or destroyed. This procedure shall provide for written documentation of the disposition of outdated drugs which must be maintained for two years after disposition of the outdated drugs.

The board shall maintain a record of referrals pursuant to this item and action taken on them. (6) A facility required to obtain a permit pursuant to this subsection but which has not been issued a permit, may not advertise its services in this State, and a resident of this State may not advertise the services for the facility.
