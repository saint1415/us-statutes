      "text": "(A) The right of a person to engage in a lawful profession, trade, or occupation of choice is clearly protected by both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of South Carolina. The State cannot abridge this right except as a reasonable exercise of its police powers when it is clearly found that abridgement is necessary for the preservation of the health, safety, and welfare of the public. (B) No statute or regulation may be imposed under this article upon a profession or occupation except for the exclusive purpose of protecting the public interest when the: (1) unregulated practice of the profession or occupation can harm or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public and the potential for harm is recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; (2) practice of the profession or occupation has inherent qualities peculiar to it that distinguish it from ordinary work or labor; (3) practice of the profession or occupation requires specialized skill or training and the public needs and will benefit by assurances of initial and continuing professional and occupational ability; and (4) public is not effectively protected by other means. (C) If the General Assembly determines that a particular profession or occupation should be regulated or that a different degree of regulation should be imposed on the regulated profession or occupation, it shall consider the following degrees of regulation in the order provided and only shall regulate the profession or occupation to the degree necessary to fulfill the need for regulation: (1) If existing common law and statutory causes of civil action or criminal prohibitions are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm or prevent potential harm, the General Assembly first may consider making statutory changes to provide stricter causes for civil action and criminal prosecution. (2) If it is necessary to determine the impact of the operation of a profession or occupation on the public, the General Assembly may consider implementing a system of registration. (3) If the public requires a substantial basis for relying on the professional services of the practitioner, the General Assembly may consider implementing a system of certification. (4) If adequate regulation cannot be achieved by means less than licensing, the General Assembly may establish licensing procedures. (D) In determining the proper degree of regulation, if any, the General Assembly shall determine: (1) whether the practitioner, if unregulated, performs a service to individuals involving a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare; (2) what the opinion of a substantial portion of the people who do not practice the particular profession, trade, or occupation is on the need for regulation; (3) the number of states which have regulatory provisions similar to those proposed; (4) whether there is sufficient demand for the service for which there is no regulated substitute, and this service is required by a substantial portion of the population; (5) whether the profession or occupation requires high standards of public responsibility, character, and performance of each individual engaged in the profession or occupation, as evidenced by established and published codes of ethics; (6) whether the profession or occupation requires such skill that the public generally is not qualified to select a competent practitioner without some assurance that the practitioner has met minimum qualifications; (7) whether the professional or occupational associations do not adequately protect the public from incompetent, unscrupulous, or irresponsible members of the profession or occupation; (8) whether current laws which pertain to public health, safety, and welfare generally are ineffective or inadequate; (9) whether the characteristics of the profession or occupation make it impractical or impossible to prohibit those practices of the profession or occupation which are detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; (10) whether the practitioner performs a service for others which may have a detrimental effect on third parties relying on the expert knowledge of the practitioner.

      "text": "(A) The department is responsible for all administrative, fiscal, investigative, inspectional, clerical, secretarial, and license renewal operations and activities of the boards and commissions enumerated in Section 40-1-40. The director shall employ and supervise personnel necessary to effectuate the provisions of this article for each board provided for in Section 40-1-40. When hiring a person charged with evaluating or administering professional qualifications or licensing standards, the director must select from a list of three candidates submitted by the appropriate licensing board. However, a candidate whose name is submitted to the director must be chosen from a list of all candidates found to be qualified by the Human Management Office of the department. The authority to remove an employee of the department is vested with the Director of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. The director shall establish compensation for personnel assigned to the boards as the director considers necessary and appropriate for the administration of this article. Compensation and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of duties by personnel assigned to the board must be paid as an expense of the board in the administration of this article. The director shall enter into contracts and agreements the director considers necessary or incidental to carry out the provisions of this article to provide for all services required by each board. Board members must be compensated for their services at the usual rate for mileage, subsistence, and per diem as provided by law for members of state boards, committees, and commissions and may be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in connection with and as a result of their work as members of the board. The director, within the limits set by the Comptroller General, shall establish reimbursement standards for travel and other expenses incurred by a board member in the performance of the board member's official duties. Compensation and reimbursements paid to board members under this subsection must be paid as an expense of the board in the administration of this article and the board's chapter and must be paid from the fees received by the board pursuant to the provisions of this article or in a manner prescribed by the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. The director shall maintain a separate account for funds collected on behalf of a board and shall indicate the expenses allotted to the board. The director shall adjust fees for revenue-funded boards in accordance with Section 40-1-50 (D). The director annually shall prepare a report to the Governor and the General Assembly indicating those regulated trades, occupations, and professions that do not meet the spirit and intent of Section 40-1-10. The director may perform any additional administrative functions requested by the boards. (B) The department shall keep a record of the proceedings of each board and shall maintain a registry of all applications for licensure, permitting, certification, and registration. The registry shall include the name, age, and last known address of each applicant, the place of business of the applicant, the education, experience, and other qualifications of the applicant, type of examination required, whether or not an authorization to practice was granted, the date of the action of the department, and other information considered necessary by the board. Except as otherwise required by law, the record of a board's proceedings and its registry of applicants must be open to public inspection, and a copy of the registry must be provided upon request and payment of a fee. Records of a board and its registry are prima facie evidence of its proceedings, and a copy certified by the administrator or the director under seal is admissible as evidence with the same force and effect as the original. (C) The department may prepare and publish a roster for each respective board containing the names and places of business of persons licensed under this article. A copy of the roster must be provided upon request and upon payment of a fee which may not exceed the cost of printing and distribution of the roster. (D) Initial fees for revenue-funded boards must be established by each board and shall serve as the base for necessary administrative adjustments. Each board, on at least a biennial basis, shall provide the director with a statement of anticipated expenditures, program changes, and other information as may be used in determining fees for the next biennial period. Fees for revenue-funded boards must be assessed, collected, and adjusted on behalf of each board by the department in accordance with this article. Fees may be adjusted biennially to ensure that they are sufficient but not excessive to cover expenses including the total of the direct and indirect costs to the State for the operations of each respective board. Fees must be deposited in accounts established for each respective board. The following steps must be used in the development and analysis of fee structures: (1) Determine current financial position of the program. Each month, the department's administrative section shall prepare statements reflecting monthly revenue collection activity and related program expenses for each board program. The financial standing of a board program must be reviewed each biennium for boards that renew biennially, annually for boards that renew on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators evidence a significant financial fluctuation of more than ten percent variance between a program's revenue and related expenses; (2) Project future activity and related costs of the program. By reviewing historical volume information and adjusting trends to reflect changes in the industry, changes in the program, indicators from the board members to the staff, and general economic indicators, project program activity including, but not limited to, renewals and new applicants for the upcoming two to three years. Based on these population projections, forecast program revenues using the current fee structure. With input from the board and the staff, analyze related program direct board costs for the upcoming two to three years, based on historical trends, changes in program requirements, changes to expenditure centers, and changes in staffing requirements. To these direct costs, add the program's proportionate share of other related costs of the program including, but not limited to, administration of exams, agency administration, and information systems to arrive at the total program cost; (3) Determine the projected financial position of the program, propose changes where necessary, and compare the total projected revenue at the current fees to the total projected costs of the program over the next two to three years. If the current fees and the projected program activity do not support the projected program's expenses, develop alternative fee structures which would ensure the program's continuing financial stability as required by law; (4) Present findings to the director and staff for discussion, revision, evaluation, and adoption. While developing fee analyses, maintain communications with staff and agency management to ensure all necessary factors are evaluated and cost savings, efficiencies, and alternative cost reduction scenarios are pursued. Present fee analyses to board staff and management for discussion and revision where necessary. Propose alternatives to the director for consideration when preparing to adopt proposed fee schedules to achieve a structure sufficient to support the program. Fees for a board funded by general appropriations must be set by the General Assembly and deposited into the general fund. All fees are nonrefundable. (E) Where appropriate, the director shall adopt the necessary procedures to implement the biennial renewal of authorizations to practice in a manner as to ensure that the number of renewals is reasonably evenly distributed throughout each two-year period. During any transition, fees must be proportionate to the biennial fee. (F) A board may elect to delegate to the department the authority to issue an authorization to practice to an applicant whose proof of qualifications falls within established guidelines set by the board. A board may elect to delegate to the department the authority to deny an authorization to practice to an applicant who has committed an act that would be grounds for disciplinary action under this article or the licensing act of the board, who has failed to comply with a final order of a board, or who has failed to demonstrate the basic qualifications or standards for practice authorization contained in the board's licensing act. The applicant may appeal the denial to the board which has final regulatory decision-making authority for reconsideration. The board may uphold the denial, order issuance of the authorization to practice, or order issuance of the authorization to practice upon conditions set by the board. If the administrative decision is upheld, the applicant may reapply at the end of a twelve-month period. (G) The department shall suspend the practice authorization issued by a board administered by this article to a person who submits a check, money draft, or similar instrument for payment of a fee which is not honored by the financial institution named. The suspension becomes effective ten days following delivery by certified mail of written notice of the dishonor and the impending suspension to the person's address. Upon notification of suspension, the person may reinstate the authorization to practice upon payment of the fee and penalties required under statute or regulation. This suspension is exempt from the Administrative Procedures Act. (H) The department shall revoke the authorization to practice of a person found to be in violation of the Family Independence Act as it relates to child support enforcement requirements. (I) The department may prepare an annual report for submission to the Governor. It is the duty of the director to notify and seek approval of the board or commission at least thirty days in advance of filing with Legislative Council as required by Section 1-23-30 of any proposed changes in any rules or regulations which may affect the practice or service of the respective licensing board or commission.

(D) If a board denies a license to an applicant under this section, then the board shall: (1) provide the applicant with a denial in writing; and (2) explain the reason for the denial in the written decision, such as whether the licensing entity determined that the applicant's apprenticeship program does not correspond to the profession or occupation or level of license for which the applicant applied.

(F) A board shall not require an applicant pursuant to this section to complete an apprenticeship for a greater duration of time than that which is required pursuant to federal law.
