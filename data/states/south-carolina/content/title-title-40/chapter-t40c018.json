If SLED does not issue a registration certificate within thirty days of receipt of the application, a security officer must cease performing all security-related activities. (3) Upon being satisfied of the suitability of the applicant for employment and the applicant's successful completion of an approved training program, SLED must register the employee and notify the licensee.

(B) Within thirty days of the employment of a person who will perform the functions of a private investigator, a private investigator licensee, or the person to be employed as an investigator must make application to SLED for registration of the person to be employed as a private investigator. After thirty days, a licensee may not authorize a person to perform the duties of a private investigator unless that person holds a valid private investigator registration certificate or has applied for one. The licensee may apply and pay the fee for the private investigator registration certificate or may require the person to be employed as an investigator to apply and pay the fee. For purposes of the penalties provisions of this chapter, the licensee and the person to be employed as an investigator are both responsible for ensuring that the person performing duties of an investigator is registered or has made application to be registered. (1) The application must be made under oath and must state the applicant's full name, age, date and place of birth, current residence address, residence addresses for the past ten years, employment for the past ten years, including names and addresses of employers, the applicant's current occupation with the name and address of the current employer, the date and place of any arrests, any convictions for violations of federal or state laws, and any additional information SLED may require.

(4) Upon receiving the application, SLED must, after investigation sufficient to verify the applicant's eligibility, integrity, and suitable background, grant registration to the applicant and so notify the employer. The registration is for a period of one year. Applications for renewal must be on a form approved by SLED. (5) While performing the functions of a private investigator, a registered person must have his valid registration certificate or a copy in his possession. (6) A registration certificate expires upon the registered investigator's termination of employment and is nontransferable to a different employer. The employer of a registered investigator must notify SLED within ten days of the termination of employment of any registered employee. (7) Initial and renewal registration fees must be set by SLED by regulation. (C) A person registered as a private investigator who is arrested must report the custodial arrest to SLED within seventy-two hours of the arrest. (D) A person is exempt from the registration and licensing requirements of this section when the employer is not a private investigation business and the employee is exclusively employed by that employer. The exemption from registration and licensing requirements applies only to work performed for the exclusive employer. If the person, during the period of his exclusive employment, performs or is available to perform investigative work for a different employer or more than one employer, the person must obtain a private investigation license or registration pursuant to this section.

(B) For violations of this chapter or any regulation pertaining to this chapter, SLED may, in its discretion, impose a civil monetary penalty upon the holder of a license or registration certificate in lieu of suspension or revocation. Security company and private investigator company licensees are subject to a monetary penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for each offense. Registered security officers and registered private investigators are subject to a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for each offense. SLED may, in its discretion, accept an offer in compromise or suspend payment of a fine or a monetary penalty imposed under this section. (C) The decision to deny, suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license or registration must be in writing, signed by the Chief of SLED or his designee, and must state the grounds upon which the decision is based. The licensee or registered individual may, within thirty days after receipt of the decision, appeal the decision to the Administrative Law Court. (D) If a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this section is not paid or a hearing is not requested within thirty days of receipt of SLED's decision, SLED must revoke the license or registration certificate.

(G) A person whose license or registration certificate has been suspended or revoked is not eligible to receive a new license or registration for another location or business during the period of suspension or revocation. (H) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, penalties paid pursuant to this section must be retained, expended, and carried forward by SLED to be applied to costs associated with regulation of the private security and private investigator businesses in this State.
