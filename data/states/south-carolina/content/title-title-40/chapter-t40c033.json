If the term \"nurse\" is part of a longer title, such as \"nurse's aide\", a person who is entitled to use that title shall use the entire title and may not abbreviate the title to \" nurse\". This does not prohibit the use of the title \"nurse\" by persons who hold a temporary permit pending licensure by endorsement from another jurisdiction, and it does not prohibit the use of the title \"nurse\" by persons enrolled in a board-approved refresher course for the purpose of obtaining an active South Carolina license. (D) A provision of this chapter may not be construed to prohibit: (1) gratuitous nursing care by friends or members of the family; (2) the incidental care of the sick by domestic servants or persons primarily employed as housekeepers as long as they do not practice nursing within the meaning of this chapter; (3) nursing assistance in case of an emergency; (4) the practice of nursing by students enrolled in approved nurse education programs; (5) the practice of nursing in this State by a legally qualified nurse of another state whose engagement requires the nurse to accompany and care for a patient temporarily residing in this State during the period of one engagement, not to exceed six months, if the person does not represent or hold herself or himself out as a nurse licensed to practice in this State; (6) the practice of any legally qualified nurse of another state who is employed by the United States government or any bureau, division, or agency of the United States government, while in the discharge of official duties; (7) care given to maternity patients, in the performance of their duties by licensed midwives trained and supervised under the authority of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, so long as these midwives confine care to maternity patients only and do not claim to be licensed nurses or certified nurse-midwives; (8) the practice of nursing by a licensed nurse of another state who is enrolled in a board-approved course of study or board-approved experimental or experiential project requiring nursing practice as a part of the educational program; (9) a person not licensed under this chapter from providing attendant care services directed by or on behalf of an individual in need of in-home care; and (10) performance of an act which a person would normally perform if the person were physically and cognitively able. (E) The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control may establish policies that authorize licensed registered nurses to provide health care under the direction of a physician licensed to practice medicine in this State and under the guidance of a registered pharmacist including, but not limited to, the dispensing of drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child care, children with special health care needs, family planning, immunizations, and any other public health program. The original diagnosis and treatment as prescribed by the physician must be maintained on the individual patient's records. The provisions of this chapter must not be construed to require the employment of registered pharmacists at local health clinics for the guidance of registered nurses in the dispensing of drugs in accordance with these provisions.

A conviction is not required to prove misconduct under this item. The board may receive evidence to reach an independent conclusion as to the commission of the violation; however, the determination may be used only in making the administrative decision regarding the proposed discipline; (2) allowed another person to use the licensee's authorization to practice; (3) wilfully or repeatedly followed a course of conduct that, by reasonable professional or ethical standards, renders the licensee incompetent to assume, perform, or be entrusted with the duties, responsibilities, or trusts which normally devolve upon a licensed nurse; (4) had a license to practice nursing in another state suspended or revoked or had other disciplinary action taken by another state; in which case, the action by another state creates a rebuttable presumption that a South Carolina nursing license may be acted upon similarly. The finding may be based solely upon the record in the other state, and there is no requirement for a de novo hearing on the facts established in that proceeding. Other evidence is admissible to support or rebut this presumption. The licensee must produce a copy of all transcripts, documents, orders, or other items from the other state's proceedings upon request by the department. Failure to produce all requested items within ninety days of the request results in the immediate temporary suspension of the license until further order of the board; (5) violated a provision of this chapter or a regulation or order of the board; (6) failed to cooperate with an investigation or other proceeding of the board; (7) failed to comply with a directive or order of the department or board; (8) disseminated a patient's health or personal information acquired during the course of practice to persons not entitled by law or hospital or agency policy to disclosure of this information; (9) falsified or altered, for the purpose of reflecting incorrect or incomplete information, any organization's records, including personnel records or patient records; (10) misappropriated money, property, or drugs from an employer or patient; (11) obtained or attempted to obtain a fee for patient service for one's self or for another through fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit; (12) wilfully aided, abetted, assisted, or hired an individual to violate a provision of this chapter or a regulation of the board; (13) obtained, possessed, administered, or furnished prescription drugs to a person including, but not limited to, one's self, except as directed by a person authorized by law to prescribe drugs; (14) engaged in the practice of nursing when judgment or physical ability is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances or has declined or been unsuccessful in accomplishing rehabilitation; (15) sustained a physical or mental disability that renders further practice dangerous to the public; (16) omitted, in a grossly negligent fashion, to record information concerning a patient that would be relevant to that patient's condition; (17) indicated the witnessing of wastage of narcotics or controlled substances on record when the wastage was not witnessed or failed to obtain a witness to the wastage of narcotics or controlled substances; (18) failed to make or keep accurate, intelligible entries in records as required by law, policy, or standards for the practice of nursing; (19) obtained, or attempted to obtain, a license to practice nursing for one's self or for another through fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or any other dishonesty in any phase of the licensing process including, but not limited to, the examination; (20) practiced nursing without a valid, current South Carolina license or aided, abetted, or assisted another to practice nursing without a valid, current South Carolina license; (21) practiced outside the scope of the license by assuming duties and responsibilities without adequate education as determined by the board; (22) failed to report incompetent or unprofessional practice of a licensed nurse to the appropriate authorities, including the board; (23) assigned unqualified persons to perform nursing care functions, tasks, or responsibilities or failed to effectively supervise persons to whom nursing functions are delegated or assigned; (24) abandoned a patient after accepting the patient assignment and establishing a nurse-patient relationship and disengaged the nurse-patient relationship without giving reasonable notice to the appropriate personnel responsible for making arrangements for continuation of nursing care; (25) failed to comply with best practice standards and recommendations to minimize transmission of infectious or communicable diseases; (26) failed to timely notify the department of changes in information required in an original or renewal application; (27) engaged in practice as an NP, CNS, or CNM without a compliant practice agreement as defined in Section 40-33-20(45); (28) failed to follow or comply with the practice agreement as defined by Section 40-33-20(45); or (29) knowingly allowed himself to be misrepresented as a physician. (B)(1) Acts or omissions by a licensee or applicant causing the denial, revocation, suspension, or restriction of a license to practice in another state supports the issuance of a formal complaint and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings. This subsection applies only if the disciplinary action taken in another state is based on grounds that would constitute misconduct in this State. Proof of these acts or omissions may be shown by a copy of the transcript of record of the disciplinary proceedings in another state or a copy of the final order, consent order, or similar order stating the basis for the action taken. (2) Upon filing an application or an initial complaint alleging that the applicant or licensee has been disciplined in another state, the applicant or licensee must produce copies of all transcripts, documents, and orders used, relied upon, or issued by the licensing authority in the other state. Failure to produce these items within ninety days of written request results in the denial of the individual's application or suspension of the individual's license to practice in this State until these items have been provided. (3) The applicant or licensee may present mitigating testimony to the board or hearing panel regarding disciplinary action taken in another state or evidence that the acts or omissions committed in another state do not constitute misconduct under this chapter.

The results of an examination are admissible in a hearing before the board, notwithstanding a claim of privilege under a contrary rule of law or statute. A person who accepts the privilege of engaging in the licensed practice of nursing in this State, or who files an application for a license to practice under this chapter, is deemed to have consented to submit to a mental or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in a hearing before the board upon the grounds that this constitutes a privileged communication. If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control, the board shall enter an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. A licensee or applicant who is required to submit to a mental or physical examination may request within twenty-four hours of receipt of the requirement a review by an administrative hearing officer appointed by the board or its designee. Filing of a written request for a review by an administrative hearing officer does not stay the time directed in which to submit to a mental or physical examination, and no stay may be issued, except as provided in this section. Upon proper written request, a review hearing must be conducted within forty-eight hours of receipt of the request. Failure to provide a review hearing within the prescribed time stays the time required to submit to a mental or physical examination until a decision is issued by the administrative hearing officer. The review hearing for purposes of this section must be limited to the issues of whether the person is a licensee or applicant, whether reasonable grounds exist to require a mental or physical examination, and whether the licensee or applicant has been informed that failure to submit to an examination will result in the entry of an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. The administrative hearing officer's decision is not subject to appeal. A licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing under this subsection must be afforded at reasonable intervals an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume or begin the practice with reasonable skill and safety. (B) The board upon probable cause may obtain records relating to the mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant including, but not limited to, psychiatric records; and these records are admissible in a hearing before the board, notwithstanding any other provision of law. A person who accepts the privilege of engaging in the licensed practice of nursing in this State, or who files an application to practice under this chapter, is deemed to have consented to the board obtaining these records and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of these records in a hearing before the board upon the grounds that this constitutes a privileged communication. If a licensee or applicant refuses to sign a written consent for the board to obtain these records when properly requested by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control, the board shall enter an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. A licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing under this subsection must be afforded at reasonable intervals an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume or begin the practice of nursing with reasonable skill and safety. (C) An order requiring a licensee or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination or an order requiring the submission of records relating to the mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant is confidential and must not be disclosed, except to the extent necessary for the proper disposition of the matter before the board. An order automatically suspending or denying a license pending compliance and further order of the board is public information under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act. A decision of an administrative hearing officer is confidential, unless an order automatically suspending or denying a license pending compliance and further order of the board has been issued, in which case the administrative hearing officer's decision and the order requiring an examination of records is public information under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act.

(B) A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. These procedures must include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records. (C) Each party state shall require the following for an applicant to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state: (1) meets the home state's qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as all other applicable state laws; (2) has graduated: (a) or is eligible to graduate from a licensing board-approved RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program; or (b) from a foreign RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program that has been: (i) approved by the authorized accrediting body in the applicable country; and (ii) verified by an independent credentials review agency to be comparable to a licensing board-approved prelicensure education program; (3) has, if a graduate of a foreign prelicensure education program not taught in English or if English is not the individual's native language, successfully passed an English proficiency examination that includes the components of reading, speaking, writing, and listening; (4) has successfully passed an NCLEX-RN or NCLEX-PN examination or recognized predecessor, as applicable; (5) is eligible for or holds an active, unencumbered license; (6) has submitted, in connection with an application for initial licensure or licensure by endorsement, fingerprints or other biometric data for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records; (7) has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a felony offense under applicable state or federal criminal law; (8) has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a misdemeanor offense related to the practice of nursing as determined on a case-by-case basis; (9) is not currently enrolled in an alternative program; (10) is subject to self-disclosure requirements regarding current participation in an alternative program; and (11) has a valid United States Social Security number. (D) All party states must be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system must promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states. (E) A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but must include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. (F) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact may affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.

Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.

(7) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action. (B) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license.

Rules and amendments become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and have the same force and effect as provisions of this compact. (B) Rules or amendments to the rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. (C) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least sixty days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking on the websites of: (1) the commission; and (2) each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules. (D) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include: (1) the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon; (2) the text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule; (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments. (E) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which must be made available to the public. (F) The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment. (G) The commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing, provided: (1) hearings must be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing; (2) all hearings will be recorded and a copy will be made available upon request; and (3) nothing in this subsection may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section. (H) If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule. (I) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received. (J) The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (K) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to: (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (2) prevent a loss of commission or party state funds; or (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule. (L) The commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission. The revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the commission before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 87, Section 2; 2017 Act No. 41 (H.3349), Section 1, eff May 10, 2017.",

      "text": "(A) Oversight. (1) Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent. (2) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission, and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the commission renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. (B) Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide: (a) written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the commission; and (b) remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (3) Termination of membership in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states. (4) A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (5) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. (6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. (C) Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. (3) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact: (a) the party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which must be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute; and (b) a decision of a majority of the arbitrators is final and binding. (D) Enforcement. (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. (3) The remedies in this section are not the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.

(B) Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the prior compact until such party state has withdrawn from the prior compact. (C) A party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state's withdrawal may not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute. (D) A party state's withdrawal or termination may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination. (E) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.
