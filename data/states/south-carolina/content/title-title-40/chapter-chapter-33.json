This does not prohibit the use of the title \"nurse\" by persons who hold a temporary permit pending licensure by endorsement from another jurisdiction, and it does not prohibit the use of the title \"nurse\" by persons enrolled in a board-approved refresher course for the purpose of obtaining an active South Carolina license.\n\n(D) A provision of this chapter may not be construed to prohibit:\n\n(1) gratuitous nursing care by friends or members of the family;\n\n(2) the incidental care of the sick by domestic servants or persons primarily employed as housekeepers as long as they do not practice nursing within the meaning of this chapter;\n\n(3) nursing assistance in case of an emergency;\n\n(4) the practice of nursing by students enrolled in approved nurse education programs;\n\n(5) the practice of nursing in this State by a legally qualified nurse of another state whose engagement requires the nurse to accompany and care for a patient temporarily residing in this State during the period of one engagement, not to exceed six months, if the person does not represent or hold herself or himself out as a nurse licensed to practice in this State;\n\n(6) the practice of any legally qualified nurse of another state who is employed by the United States government or any bureau, division, or agency of the United States government, while in the discharge of official duties;\n\n(7) care given to maternity patients, in the performance of their duties by licensed midwives trained and supervised under the authority of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, so long as these midwives confine care to maternity patients only and do not claim to be licensed nurses or certified nurse-midwives;\n\n(8) the practice of nursing by a licensed nurse of another state who is enrolled in a board-approved course of study or board-approved experimental or experiential project requiring nursing practice as a part of the educational program;\n\n(9) a person not licensed under this chapter from providing attendant care services directed by or on behalf of an individual in need of in-home care; and\n\n(10) performance of an act which a person would normally perform if the person were physically and cognitively able.\n\n(E) The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control may establish policies that authorize licensed registered nurses to provide health care under the direction of a physician licensed to practice medicine in this State and under the guidance of a registered pharmacist including, but not limited to, the dispensing of drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child care, children with special health care needs, family planning, immunizations, and any other public health program. The original diagnosis and treatment as prescribed by the physician must be maintained on the individual patient's records. The provisions of this chapter must not be construed to require the employment of registered pharmacists at local health clinics for the guidance of registered nurses in the dispensing of drugs in accordance with these provisions.\n\nHISTORY: 2004 Act No. 225, Section 1; 2005 Act No. 122, Section 1.",

A licensee or applicant who is required to submit to a mental or physical examination may request within twenty-four hours of receipt of the requirement a review by an administrative hearing officer appointed by the board or its designee. Filing of a written request for a review by an administrative hearing officer does not stay the time directed in which to submit to a mental or physical examination, and no stay may be issued, except as provided in this section.

Failure to provide a review hearing within the prescribed time stays the time required to submit to a mental or physical examination until a decision is issued by the administrative hearing officer.

If a licensee or applicant refuses to sign a written consent for the board to obtain these records when properly requested by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control, the board shall enter an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n(3) Termination of membership in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.\n\n(4) A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(5) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices.
