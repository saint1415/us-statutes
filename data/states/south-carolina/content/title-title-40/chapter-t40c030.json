      "text": "The General Assembly recognizes that the practice of massage therapy is potentially harmful to the public in that massage therapists must have a knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, and physiology and an understanding of the relationship between the structure and the function of the tissues being treated and the total function of the body. Massage therapy is therapeutic, and regulations are necessary to protect the public from unqualified massage therapists and unsafe establishments. It is, therefore, necessary in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to regulate the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage therapy establishments and sole practitioner establishments in this State. However, restrictions must be imposed to the extent necessary to protect the public from significant and discernible danger to health and yet not in such a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market. Further, consumer protection for both health and economic matters must be afforded to the public through legal remedies provided for in this chapter.
