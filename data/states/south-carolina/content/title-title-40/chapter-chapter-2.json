In aid of investigations, the administrator of the board shall issue subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify and to produce evidence, as necessary for an appropriate investigation.\n\n(B)(1) An investigation of a licensee pursuant to this chapter must be performed by an inspector-investigator who has been licensed as a certified public accountant in this State for at least five years. The inspector-investigator must report the results of his investigation to the board no later than one hundred fifty days after the date upon which he initiated his investigation. If the inspector-investigator has not completed his investigation by that date, then the board may extend the investigation for a period defined by the board.

Upon failure to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the board or its hearing officer or panel, the board may apply to the Administrative Law Court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.\n\n(E) The testimony and documents submitted in support of the complaint or gathered in the investigation must be treated as confidential information and must not be disclosed to any person except law enforcement authorities and, to the extent necessary in order to conduct the investigation, the subject of the investigation, persons whose complaints are being investigated, and witnesses questioned in the course of the investigation. All proceedings related to the investigations and inquiries during the investigation process undertaken pursuant to this chapter are confidential, unless the licensee or registrant who is the subject of the investigation or inquiry waives the confidentiality of the existence of the complaint.\n\n(F) The board may review the publicly available professional work of licensees, and all professional work submitted to the State, on a general and random basis, without any requirement of a formal complaint or suspicion of impropriety.
