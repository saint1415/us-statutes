A behavioral telehealth provider has the duty to practice in a manner consistent with his scope of practice and the prevailing professional standard of practice for a behavioral health care professional who provides in-person professional counseling, addiction counseling, marriage and family therapy, and licensed psycho-educational specialist services to clients in this State. (B) Individuals who hold an active license to provide professional counseling, addiction counseling, marriage and family therapy, and licensed psycho-educational specialist services in another state or jurisdiction may provide these services using behavioral telehealth to a client located in this State if the individual is registered with the board and provides the services within the applicable scope of practice established by this State.

(E) The individual may not register under this subsection if his license to provide professional counseling, addiction counseling, marriage and family therapy, or licensed psycho-educational specialist services is subject to a pending disciplinary investigation or action, or has been revoked in any state or jurisdiction. An individual registered under this section must notify the board of restrictions placed on his license to practice or any disciplinary action taken or pending against him in any state or jurisdiction. The notification must be provided within five business days after the restriction is placed or disciplinary action is initiated or taken. (F) The board shall publish on its website a list of all registrants and include, to the extent applicable, each registrant's: (1) name; (2) address; (3) out-of-state professional license type with the license number; and (4) South Carolina behavioral telehealth registration number. (G) The board may take disciplinary action against an out-of-state registrant registered under this section if the individual: (1) fails to notify the board of any adverse actions taken against his license as required under subsection (E); (2) has restrictions placed on or disciplinary action taken against his license in any state or jurisdiction; (3) violates any of the requirements of this section; or (4) commits any act that constitutes grounds for disciplinary action under the board's statutes or regulations. (H) For the purposes of this section, the delivery of behavioral telehealth services by a registrant licensed by another state or jurisdiction to a client residing in this State is deemed to occur in this State, and the registrant consents, as a condition of registration, to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and disciplinary authority of the board. (I) Nothing in this section requires or authorizes an individual licensed by this State pursuant to this chapter to obtain a behavioral telehealth registration in order to provide behavioral telehealth services to a client residing in this State.

      "text": "(A) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purpose of the compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. (B) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment. (C) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state. (D) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. (E) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking: (1) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform; and (2) on the website of each member-state professional counseling licensing board or other publicly accessible platform or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules. (F) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include: (1) the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon; (2) the text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule; (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments. (G) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public. (H) The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by: (1) at least twenty-five persons; (2) a state or federal governmental subdivision or agency; or (3) an association having at least twenty-five members. (I) If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.

(2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. (3) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording will be made available on request. (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section. (J) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received. (K) If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing. (L) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (M) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided, that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to: (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (2) prevent a loss of commission or member-state funds; (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or (4) protect public health and safety. (N) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. HISTORY: 2024 Act No. 189 (S.610), Section 2, eff May 21, 2024.",

(C) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (D) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. (E) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.

The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. (H) Dispute resolution: (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. (I) Enforcement: (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
