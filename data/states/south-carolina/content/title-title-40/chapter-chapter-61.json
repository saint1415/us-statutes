Members of the board are eligible for reappointment but cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.\n\nThe board is responsible for examining applicants for registered environmental sanitarians, investigating complaints, and investigating and prosecuting violations of this chapter.\n\nThe board may promulgate regulations to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\n\nThe Governor may remove any member of the board who has been guilty of continued neglect of his duties or who is found to be incompetent, unprofessional, or dishonorable. No member must be removed without first giving him an opportunity to refute the charges filed against him. He must be given a copy of the charges at the time they are filed.\n\nVacancies on the board are filled in the same manner as the original appointment for the unexpired portion of the term.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 56-1546.1; 1962 (52) 1918; 1984 Act No. 512, Part II, Section 58A.",
