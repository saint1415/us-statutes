(B) \"Misconduct\" that constitutes grounds for disciplinary action is a showing to the board by the preponderance of evidence that a licensee has: (1) used a false, fraudulent, or forged statement or document or practiced a fraudulent, deceitful, or dishonest act in connection with a licensing requirement; (2) been convicted of, has pled guilty to, or has pled nolo contendere to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude or drugs. For purposes of this item, \"drugs\" includes a substance whose possession, use, or distribution is governed by Article 3, Chapter 53 of Title 44, Narcotics and Controlled Substances, or which is listed in the current edition of the Physician's Desk Reference; (3) violated a federal, state, or local law involving alcohol or drugs or committed an act involving a crime of moral turpitude. The board may receive evidence to reach an independent conclusion as to the commission of the violation; however, the determination may be used only in making the administrative decision; (4) engaged in the habitual or excessive use or abuse of drugs, alcohol, or other substances that impair ability; (5) attempted to practice when judgment or physical ability is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or other substances; (6) been convicted of or sanctioned for illegal or unauthorized practice; (7) knowingly performed an act that in any way assists an unlicensed person to practice; (8) sustained a physical or mental impairment that renders further practice by the licensee dangerous to the public or that may interfere with the licensee's ability to competently and safely perform the essential functions of practice; (9) engaged in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct that is likely either to deceive, defraud, or harm the public; (10) used a false or fraudulent statement in a document connected with the licensee's practice; (11) obtained fees or assisted in obtaining fees under dishonorable, false, or fraudulent circumstances; (12) intentionally violated or attempted to violate, directly or indirectly, or is assisting in or abetting the violation of or conspiring to violate the medical practice laws; (13) violated the code of medical ethics adopted by the board or has been found by the board to lack the ethical or professional competence to practice; (14) violated a provision of this chapter or a regulation or order of the board; (15) failed to cooperate with an investigation or other proceeding of the board; (16) failed to comply with an order, subpoena, or directive of the board or department; (17) failed to prepare or maintain an adequate patient record of care provided; (18) engaged in disruptive behavior or interaction, or both, with physicians, hospital personnel, patients, family members, or others that interferes with patient care or could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the quality of care rendered to a patient. This behavior may include, but is not limited to, inappropriate sexual behavior; (19) engaged in behavior that exploits the physician-patient relationship in a sexual way. This behavior is nondiagnostic and nontherapeutic, may be written, verbal, or physical and may include expressions of thoughts and feelings or gestures that are sexual or that reasonably may be construed by a patient as sexual. This behavior includes sexual contact with patient surrogates or key third parties; (20) failed to appear before the board after receiving a formal notice to appear; (21) signed a blank prescription form; (22) failed to report to the board any adverse disciplinary action by another United States or foreign licensing jurisdiction, a peer review body, a health care institution, by any professional or medical society or association, a board-approved credentialing organization, a governmental agency, a law enforcement agency, including arrest, or a court, including indictment, for acts or conduct similar to acts or conduct that would constitute grounds for disciplinary action as provided for in this section; (23) failed to provide pertinent and necessary medical records to another physician or patient in a timely fashion when lawfully requested to do so by a patient or by a lawfully designated representative of a patient; (24) improperly managed medical records, including failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate, and complete medical records; or (25) provided false, deceptive, or misleading testimony as an expert witness in an administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding in this State. (26) engaged in a practice with an NP, CNM, or CNS without a practice agreement as defined in Section 40-47-20(35) in place at the time that practice was initiated and during its continuation; or (27) failed to follow or comply with the practice agreement as defined in Section 40-47-20(35) while engaged in a practice with an NP, CNM, or CNS. (C) In addition to all other remedies and actions incorporated in this chapter, a licensee who is adjudged mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically must be suspended by the board until the licensee is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, or in another manner provided by law, as being restored to mental competency. The automatic suspension of a license pursuant to this section is public information under the Freedom of Information Act. (D) A decision by the board to revoke, suspend, or restrict a license or to limit or discipline a licensee must be by majority vote of the board members serving, except that the board may delegate to the chairman or vice chairman of the board the authority to issue orders to temporarily suspend licenses or to seek from the Administrative Law Court an order temporarily suspending or restricting a license pending final decision by the board, as follows: (1) when the chairman or vice chairman of the board determines that public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in an order, a temporary suspension order may be issued without a prior hearing being afforded to the licensee, in which event the licensee may request by the close of the next business day after receipt of the order a review by the administrative hearing officer. The fact of suspension or restriction of a license, and the fact of any subsequent related action, is public information under the Freedom of Information Act after issuance of an order by the chairman or vice chairman, unless a review by the administrative hearing officer has been timely requested in writing. Filing a written request for a review by the administrative hearing officer does not stay the temporary suspension and no stay may be issued; however, the fact of the issuance of the temporary suspension order must not be made public until the time for requesting a review has passed or the administrative hearing officer issues an order after a review hearing. Upon proper written request, a review hearing must be held by the administrative hearing officer within three business days of the filing of the request for review, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If the issuance of the temporary suspension order is not sustained by the administrative hearing officer, the matter must remain confidential and must not be made public, except to the extent the board considers it relevant to the final decision of the board; or (2) the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, acting through the Office of General Counsel or its designee, at the direction of the chairman or vice chairman of the board, may petition the Administrative Law Court for an order temporarily suspending or restricting a license pending final decision by the board. A hearing must be held by the Administrative Law Court within three business days of the filing of the petition, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If an order temporarily suspending or restricting a license is not issued by the administrative law judge, the matter must remain confidential and must not be made public, except to the extent the board considers it relevant to the final decision of the board. The fact of suspension or restriction of a license, and the fact of any subsequent related action, is public information under the Freedom of Information Act after issuance of an order by the Administrative Law Court. (E) Motions for continuance and for other interlocutory relief are not subject to review by the Administrative Law Court until a final decision has been issued by the board. A licensee against whom disciplinary action is taken in a final decision pursuant to this article has the right to review by the Administrative Law Court as provided in Section 40-1-160. If the board has revoked, suspended, or restricted a license in any manner for six months or more, including probation conditions, an appeal taken to the Administrative Law Court as provided in Section 40-1-160 has precedence on the court's calendar, is considered an emergency appeal, and should be heard not later than thirty days from the date the petition is filed. The review is limited to the record established by the board hearing. No stay or supersedeas may be granted by the administrative law judge or a reviewing court pending appeal from a final decision by the board to revoke, suspend, or restrict a license for six months or more. (F)(1) If a person is found by the board to have engaged in conduct that subverts or attempts to subvert the security or integrity of the licensing examination process, the board may have the scores on the licensing examination withheld or declared invalid. The individual may be disqualified from practice or be subjected to the imposition of any other appropriate sanction provided by Section 40-47-120. (2) Conduct that subverts or attempts to subvert the security or integrity of the medical licensing examination process includes, but is not limited to, conduct that violates the: (a) security of examination materials including, but not limited to, the improper reproduction or reconstruction of any portion of the licensing examination; aiding in the improper reproduction or reconstruction of any portion of the licensing examination; or selling, distributing, buying, receiving, or having unauthorized possession of any portion of a future, current, or previously administered licensing examination; (b) standard of test administration including, but not limited to, improperly communicating with any other examinee during the administration of a licensing examination; copying answers from another examinee or permitting one's own answers to be copied by another examinee during the administration of a licensing examination; or having in one's possession during the administration of a licensing examination any books, notes, other written or printed materials, or data of any kind other than the examination materials or other materials authorized by the board; and (c) credentials process including, but not limited to, falsifying or misrepresenting educational credentials or other information required for admission to the licensing examination, impersonating an examinee, or having an impersonator take the licensing examination in one's behalf.

A person who accepts the privilege of engaging in licensed practice in this State pursuant to this chapter, or who files an application for a license to practice pursuant to this chapter, is considered to have consented to submit to a professional competency, mental, or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in a hearing before the board upon the grounds that this constitutes a privileged communication. If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control, the board shall enter an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. A licensee or applicant who is required to submit to a professional competency, mental, or physical examination may request by the close of the next business day after receipt of the requirement a review by the administrative hearing officer. Filing a written request for a review by the administrative hearing officer does not stay the time directed in which to submit to a professional competency, mental, or physical examination, and no stay may be issued, except as provided in this section. Upon proper written request, a review hearing must be conducted within three business days of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Failure to provide a review hearing within the prescribed time stays the time required to submit to a professional competency, mental, or physical examination until a decision is issued by the administrative hearing officer. The review hearing for purposes of this section must be limited to the issues of whether the person is a licensee or applicant, whether reasonable grounds exist to require a professional competency, mental, or physical examination, and whether the licensee or applicant has been informed that failure to submit to an examination will result in the entry of an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. The administrative hearing officer's decision is not subject to appeal. A licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing pursuant to this subsection must be afforded at reasonable intervals an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume or begin the practice with reasonable skill and safety. (B) The board upon probable cause may obtain records relating to the professional competency or mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant including, but not limited to, psychiatric records, which are admissible in a hearing before the board, notwithstanding any other provision of law. A person who accepts the privilege of engaging in licensed practice in this State pursuant to this chapter, or who files an application to practice pursuant to this chapter, is considered to have consented to the board obtaining these records and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of these records in a hearing before the board upon the grounds that this constitutes a privileged communication. If a licensee or applicant refuses to sign a written consent for the board to obtain these records when properly requested by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control, the board shall enter an order automatically suspending or denying the license pending compliance and further order of the board. A licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing under this subsection must be afforded at reasonable intervals an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume or begin the practice of medicine with reasonable skill and safety. (C) An order requiring a licensee or applicant to submit to a professional competency, mental, or physical examination or an order requiring the submission of records relating to the professional competency or mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant is confidential and must not be disclosed, except to the extent necessary for the proper disposition of the matter before the board or administrative hearing officer. The fact of automatic suspension or denial of a license pending compliance and further order of the board is public information under the Freedom of Information Act. A review hearing and decision of an administrative hearing officer are confidential, unless an order automatically suspending or denying a license pending compliance and further order of the board has been issued, in which case the fact of suspension or denial of a license by the administrative hearing officer is public information under the Freedom of Information Act.

The initial complaint must be dated, signed by the person making the complaint or the administrator or director when appropriate, and must identify the subject of the complaint and contain a brief summary of the nature of the complaint. Initial complaints must be filed with the director, or his designee, who may cause an investigation to be made into the allegation of professional misconduct. If the initial complaint on its face does not demonstrate an allegation of misconduct pursuant to this chapter, an investigation may not ensue. If the initial complaint does not demonstrate an allegation of misconduct pursuant to this chapter after investigation, the initial complaint may be dismissed. The department shall notify in writing the person initially complaining of the reason for dismissing the initial complaint. Except as provided in Section 40-47-190, the identity of the person making the initial complaint must remain privileged and confidential and must not be disclosed for use in any administrative or judicial proceeding of any kind. If a formal complaint is authorized, the identity of the initial complainant must continue to remain privileged and confidential, and must not be disclosed during the conduct of formal proceedings, upon administrative or judicial review, or at any time after that for use in any administrative or judicial proceeding of any kind, unless the initial complainant testifies as a witness in the formal proceedings. (B) Before authorization of a formal complaint, the department shall provide an opportunity for the respondent to have an informal conference concerning the alleged misconduct with representatives of the department, including a physician designated by the board. The respondent may be represented by counsel at the conference, and the department shall so inform the respondent. Communications during the informal conference must be confidential. The parties shall maintain the confidentiality of the informal conference and shall not rely on, or introduce as evidence in any proceedings, any oral or written communications having occurred during the informal conference, unless such communications are obtained by means other than the informal conference. An agreement reached by the respondent and department must be documented in writing and signed by the respondent and the department and may provide for formal or informal disposition of the allegations, with or without admitting and denying misconduct. An agreement is not final until it has been submitted to and approved by the board. An agreement marked private must be placed in the respondent's file within the department and maintained as confidential pursuant to Section 40-47-190(F). HISTORY: 2006 Act No. 385, Section 1.",

      "text": "(A) A formal complaint must be issued by the Office of General Counsel after investigation upon a finding by one or more physicians designated by the board that probable cause exists to believe that professional misconduct may have been committed. Formal complaints must be captioned \"In the Matter of (name of respondent)\" and signed by an attorney assigned or designated by the Office of General Counsel. The department shall cause to be sent to the respondent or counsel, if any, by certified mail a formal complaint setting forth in summary fashion the alleged misconduct together with a notice requiring that the respondent file with the department an answer to the formal complaint and to serve a copy of the answer upon the attorney assigned or designated by the Office of General Counsel within thirty days after the notice and formal complaint are mailed. The notice mailed to the respondent must state that if the respondent fails to answer, judgment by default may be taken against the respondent. The answer must be signed by the respondent or counsel or by both and may be verified. If no answer has been filed by the respondent or counsel after thirty calendar days from the date of receipt by the respondent of the notice and formal complaint and no extension has been granted, the allegations of the formal complaint must be considered admitted, and the board may proceed and render a default judgment against the respondent. (B)(1) After the respondent's answer has been filed, or the time within which the respondent was required to file the answer has expired, a formal hearing into the matter must be held by a panel of one lay member and not more than three physician members of the Medical Disciplinary Commission, none of which may reside or have a major part of their practice in the same county as the respondent. If the facts are not in dispute, the matter may be presented directly to the board for final decision without need for a panel hearing. The Office of General Counsel or its designee shall prepare and present the matter before the panel and board, as appropriate. Hearings must be held by the panel or board upon thirty days notice to the Office of General Counsel and the respondent or counsel. (2) If the panel finds that the charges in the formal complaint are not supported by the evidence or do not merit taking disciplinary action, the panel shall make a certified report of the proceedings before it, including its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall file the report with the department. (3) If the panel finds and determines that the respondent is guilty of misconduct, the panel shall submit a certified report of its proceedings, including its recommendation as to findings of fact, conclusions of law, and mitigating and aggravating circumstances for consideration by the board and shall file this report with the department together with a transcript of the testimony taken and the exhibits put into evidence before the panel. The panel may not recommend to the board whether a sanction should or should not be imposed. (4) A copy of the panel's report must be served upon the Office of General Counsel and the respondent or counsel. (5) In the event of a tie vote by the panel, the matter must be presented to the board for final decision upon separate reports submitted by each side of the tie vote. (C) When the panel has filed its report, the department shall notify the respondent or counsel, if any, of the time and place at which the board will consider the report for the purpose of determining its action on the report, the notice must be given not less than thirty days before the meeting. The respondent and the Office of General Counsel have the right to appear before the board and to submit briefs and be heard in oral argument in opposition to or in support of the recommendations of the panel. (D) Upon consideration of the panel's report and of the showing made to the board, the board may: (1) refer the matter back to a panel for hearing; (2) order a further hearing before the board; or (3) proceed upon the certified report of the prior proceedings before the panel. (E) Upon its final review, the board either may dismiss the complaint or find that the respondent is guilty of misconduct. If the formal complaint is dismissed, the department shall notify the respondent or counsel, if any, and the Office of General Counsel. (F) If the board determines that the respondent is guilty of misconduct meriting sanction, the board shall issue a final order, including its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision of sanction, and shall file the report with the department, which promptly shall serve the respondent or counsel, if any, and the Office of General Counsel with a copy of the board's final order. (G) Service of notices conclusively must be presumed thirty days after mailing by first class or certified mail to the respondent to the last address provided to the board by the respondent. (H) When provision is made for the service of any notice, order, report, or other paper or copy of these upon any person in connection with any proceeding, service may be made upon counsel of record for the person, either personally or by first class or certified mail. (I) Service of notice upon a respondent who cannot be found at the last known address provided by the respondent may be made by leaving with the director, or his designee, a copy of the notice and any accompanying documents along with proof of attempted service at the last known address. The board may set aside and reopen a proceeding upon satisfactory showing by the respondent of good cause as to why the respondent did not receive service of the notice.

Within twenty days of an answer being filed, the Office of General Counsel, or its designee, and the respondent or counsel shall exchange the names and addresses of all persons known to have knowledge of the relevant facts. Except as provided in Section 40-47-190, the name and address of the initial complainant or a confidential informant must not be exchanged unless the person is expected to testify in the proceeding. The Office of General Counsel, or its designee, or the respondent or counsel may withhold information only with permission of the presiding officer, who shall authorize withholding of the information only for good cause shown, taking into consideration the materiality of the information possessed by the witness and the position the witness occupies in relation to the respondent. The presiding officer's review of the withholding request must be en camera, but the party making the request shall advise the opposing party of the request without disclosing the subject of the request. The presiding officer shall set a date for the exchange of the names and addresses of all witnesses the parties intend to call at the hearing. (B) The Office of General Counsel, or its designee, and respondent or counsel shall exchange: (1) notwithstanding Section 40-47-190, evidence relevant to the formal charges, documents to be presented at the hearing and statements of witnesses who will be called at the hearing, except evidence privileged pursuant to other state law. For purposes of this item, a witness statement is a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it or a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription of any of these, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded; and (2) other material only upon good cause shown to the presiding officer of the panel. (C) Copies of transcripts of testimony taken by a court reporter pursuant to this section may be obtained by the parties from the court reporter at the expense of the requesting party and are not required to be made available to the requesting party by the opposing party unless not otherwise available. (D) Depositions are only allowed if agreed upon by the Office of General Counsel, or its designee, and the respondent or counsel, or if the presiding officer grants permission to do so based upon a showing of good cause. The presiding officer may place restrictions or conditions on the manner, time, and place of an authorized deposition. Depositions must be completed not later than fifteen days before a scheduled hearing. A deposition request filed less than fifteen days before a scheduled hearing must not be granted absent a showing of exceptional circumstances. (E) A party may take the deposition de bene esse of a supporting witness who will be unavailable to testify at hearing without order of the presiding officer and as a matter of right under due process of law. Other parties must be notified and afforded the opportunity to participate in the deposition de bene esse upon not less than ten days notice, unless sooner ordered by the presiding officer or agreed to by all participating parties. The admissibility of a deposition de bene esse or portion of the deposition must be determined by the presiding officer or board not less than five days prior to the time it is to be offered into evidence. (F) Prehearing motions must be made to the presiding officer in writing and must state the grounds for relief and the relief sought. Motions pertaining to the hearing must be filed not later than ten days before the hearing date, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. Any party may file a written response to the motion within five days unless the time is extended or shortened by the presiding officer. (G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Office of General Counsel, or its designee, shall provide the respondent with exculpatory evidence relevant to the formal charges. (H) Both parties have a continuing duty to supplement information required to be exchanged under this section. (I) If a party fails to disclose timely a witness's name and address, statements by the witness, or other evidence required to be disclosed or exchanged pursuant to this section, the panel or presiding officer may grant a continuance of the hearing, preclude the party from calling the witness or introducing the document, or take other action as may be appropriate. If the Office of General Counsel, or its designee, has not disclosed timely exculpatory material, the panel or presiding officer may require the matter to be disclosed and grant a continuance or take other action as may be appropriate. (J) Disputes concerning depositions and the disclosure or exchange of information must be determined by the panel or presiding officer. Review of these decisions are not subject to an interlocutory appeal and must be challenged by filing objections to the panel's report within fifteen days from the service of the report. Failure to file objections to the panel report constitutes acceptance of the ruling on the issue. HISTORY: 2006 Act No. 385, Section 1.",

(B) Upon ordering suspension, an action may be stayed upon terms and conditions as the board considers appropriate including, but not limited to, probation, payment of a fine, or other reasonable action, such as requiring additional education and training or limitation on practice. (C) The board may require the licensee to pay a fine of up to twenty-five thousand dollars and the costs of the disciplinary action. Fines are payable immediately upon the effective date of discipline unless otherwise provided by the board. Interest accrues after fines are due at the maximum rate allowed by law. No licensee against whom a fine is levied is eligible for reinstatement until the fine has been paid in full. Fines must be deposited in a special fund established for the department to defray the administrative costs associated with investigations and hearings pursuant to this chapter. (D) A person whose authorization to practice has been permanently revoked never may be readmitted to practice in this State. A person whose authorization to practice has been revoked shall surrender within fifteen days after the effective date of the revocation the wall certificate and wallet card to the board administrator. The wall certificate and wallet card must be destroyed by the board administrator. (E) A licensee may relinquish an authorization to practice instead of further disciplinary proceedings, subject to acceptance by the board chairman as being in the public interest. This action must be taken in writing on a form approved by the board. This action is irrevocable by the licensee upon signature by the licensee. Relinquishment must be given the same effect as a revocation of an authorization to practice and must be considered a public action under the Freedom of Information Act. (F) Final orders of the board in a disciplinary proceeding must be issued upon approval of the board. Final orders must be kept on file in the board's office and must be distributed as public orders of the board, except those designated as private reprimands or dismissals. Final orders, except those designated as private reprimands or dismissals, must be filed promptly with the Federation of State Boards of Medical Examiners and other national databases as required by law. A final order of the board, including those designated as private reprimands or dismissals, must be provided to the respondent.

(E) Upon a finding on the record that the health or safety or the personal privacy of a witness or patient would be put at risk unreasonably by the public disclosure of identifying information or of other personal information, the board, hearing officer, or panel may issue an order to protect the witness or patient from the harm shown to be probable from public disclosure. (F) Information that has been declared confidential or personal pursuant to this chapter or another applicable law must not be disclosed, except to the extent necessary for the proper disposition of the matter before the board, and is protected in the same manner as provided in Section 40-71-20, or as otherwise provided by law.

Upon disclosure of confidential or personal information in violation of this chapter, the department may refuse to provide further information to the violator. (3) An entity or individual assessed administrative penalties may appeal those penalties to the board within ten days of receipt of the citation. If an appeal is filed, the department shall schedule a hearing before the board, which shall make a determination in the matter. If no appeal is filed, the citation is considered a final order and the administrative penalties must be paid within thirty days of receipt of the citation or other written demand. (I) No information in investigative files or disciplinary proceedings is required to be expunged pursuant to any other provision of state law. (J) Every communication, oral or written, to the board, department, staff, counsel, expert reviewers or witnesses, or any other person acting on behalf of the board or department during the investigation, hearing, or adjudication of the disciplinary matters including, but not limited to, investigative reports concerning interviews and issues under investigation, correspondence, summaries, incident reports, computer printouts, and documents created during peer review proceedings are privileged from disclosure. Those persons and entities making such communications are immune from liability. (K) Nothing in this chapter may be construed as prohibiting the respondent or the respondent's counsel from exercising the respondent's right of due process under the law or as prohibiting the respondent from access to the evidence relevant to the formal charges, documents to be presented at the hearing, and statements of witnesses who will be called at the hearing.
