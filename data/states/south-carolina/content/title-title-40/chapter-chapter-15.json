All appointments to the board of the seven members of the board representing the congressional districts shall be made upon the recommendation of the board, which recommendation shall be based upon an annual election conducted by the board. This election shall be conducted on a rotating basis in the seven congressional districts in numerical order so that each year the licensed dentists residing in the subject district shall elect from among themselves a member of the board. The board at its regular annual meeting shall certify in writing to the Governor the name of the person winning the election and the name of the person the nominee replaces on the board. The Governor may reject any or all of the nominees upon satisfactory showing as to the unfitness of those rejected. If the Governor declines to appoint any of such nominees so submitted, additional nominees shall be submitted in the same manner. Vacancies shall be filled in a like manner by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term.\n\n(C) The board shall conduct an election to nominate a dental hygienist when such seat shall be vacant. This election shall provide for participation by all dental hygienists currently licensed and residing in South Carolina. The name of the nominee shall be forwarded to the Governor for appointment. The Governor may reject the nominee upon satisfactory showing as to the unfitness of the nominee. If the Governor declines to appoint any nominee so submitted, additional nominees shall be submitted in the same manner. Vacancies shall be filled in a like manner by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term. No person shall be eligible for appointment who has a financial interest or serves as an officer in a business organized under the laws of this State to sell dental supplies, equipment, or appurtenances or who is officially connected with a school of dentistry or dental hygiene.\n\n(D) Vacancies shall be filled in a like manner by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term.\n\n(E) All members of the board have full voting rights except that the lay member is exempt from voting on examinations for licensure and the dental hygienists are exempt from voting on examination for licensure for dentists.\n\n(F) The Governor may remove any member of the board who has been guilty of continued neglect of his duties or who is found to be incompetent, unprofessional, or dishonorable. No member shall be removed without first giving him an opportunity to refute the charges filed against him.

      "text": "For purposes of this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Analgesia\" means the diminution or elimination of pain with full consciousness maintained by the patient.\n\n(2) \"Deep sedation\" means a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not considered a purposeful response. The ability to independently maintain ventilator function may be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining patients' airways. Spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.\n\n(3) \"Direct supervision\" means that a dentist is in the dental office, personally diagnoses the condition to be treated, personally authorizes the procedure, and before the dismissal of the patient, evaluates the performance of the auxiliary. This requirement does not mandate that a dentist be present at all times, but he or she must be on the premises actually involved in supervision and control.\n\n(4) \"Enteral\" means a route of administration that includes any technique in which the agent is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or oral mucosa.\n\n(5) \"General anesthesia\" means a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not aroused, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory functions is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining patients' airways; positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.\n\n(a) Because sedation and general anesthesia are on a continuum, it is not always possible to predict how an individual patient will respond. Hence, practitioners intending to produce a given level of sedation should be able to diagnose and manage the physiologic consequences for patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than initially intended.\n\n(b) For all levels of sedation, the practitioner must have the training, skills, drugs, and equipment to identify and manage such an occurrence until either assistance arrives or the patient returns to the intended level of sedation without airway or cardiovascular complications.\n\n(6) \"General supervision\" means that a licensed dentist or the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's public health dentist has authorized the procedures to be performed but does not require that a dentist be present when the procedures are performed.\n\n(7) \"Inhalation\" means a route of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent introduced into the lungs and whose primary effect is due to absorption through the interface of gas and blood.\n\n(8) \"Local anesthesia\" means the elimination of sensation, especially pain, in one part of the body by the topical application or regional as applies to dental, oral, or maxillofacial injection of a drug.\n\n(9) \"Minimal sedation\" means a minimally depressed level of consciousness, produced by a pharmacological method, that retains the patient's ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway and respond normally to tactile stimulation and verbal command. Although cognitive functions and coordination may be modestly impaired, ventilator and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.\n\n(a) When the intent is minimal sedation for adults, the appropriate initial dosing of a single enteral drug is no more than the maximum recommended dose of a drug that can be prescribed for unmonitored home use.\n\n(b) The use of preoperative sedatives for children under thirteen years of age before arrival in the dental office, except in extraordinary situations, must be avoided due to the risk of unobserved respiratory obstruction during transport by untrained individuals.\n\n(c) Children under thirteen years of age may become moderately sedated despite the intended level of minimal sedation; should this occur, the guidelines for moderate sedation apply.\n\n(d) For children under thirteen years of age, the board supports the American Dental Association's stance that supports the use of the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's \"Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients During and After Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures\".\n\n(e) Nitrous oxide, oxygen, or both, may be used in combination with a single enteral drug in minimal sedation.\n\n(f) Nitrous oxide, oxygen, or both, when used in combination with a sedative agent may produce minimal, moderate, or deep sedation/general anesthesia.\n\n(10) \"Moderate sedation\" means a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain patients' airways, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.\n\n(11) \"Oral prophylaxis\" means the removal of any and all hard and soft deposits, accretions, toxins, and stain from any natural or restored surfaces of teeth or prosthetic devices by scaling and polishing as a preventive measure for the control of local irritational factors.\n\n(12) \"Parenteral\" means a route of administration in which the drug bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n(13) \"Titration\" means the administration of moderate or greater sedation. The term means administration of incremental doses of a drug until a desired effect is reached. Knowledge of each drug's time of onset, peak response, and duration of action is essential to avoid oversedation. Although the concept of titration of a drug to effect is critical for patient safety, when the intent is moderate sedation, one must know whether the previous dose has taken full effect before administering an additional drug increment.\n\n(14) \"Transdermal\" means a route of administration in which the drug is administered by patch or iontophoreis through skin.\n\n(15) \"Transmucosal\" means a route of administration in which the drug is administered across mucosa such as intranasal, sublingual, or rectal.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 363, Section 2; 2000 Act No. 298, Section 2; 2003 Act No. 45, Section 2; 2014 Act No. 222 (S.1036), Section 3, eff January 1, 2015.",
