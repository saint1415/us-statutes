(C) For purposes of subsection (A)(1), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (A)(1) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.

(B) The State Ports Authority is hereby directed to sell all its real and personal property at Port Royal as soon as practicable. The property must be marketed for sale in whole, or in parcels, at the discretion of the State Ports Authority. (C)(1)(a) The State Ports Authority, in its discretion, shall determine the manner of the sale. In no event shall terms of the sale extend beyond June 30, 2015, except as provided in subitems (b) and (c). The sale of the property in an amount permitted by item (3) shall satisfy the board's fiduciary duties to the authority and the authority's bondholders. (b) If the State Ports Authority has accepted a bona fide offer to purchase a parcel of the property, or an offer to purchase the property in whole, but the sale has not closed as of June 30, 2015, then the parcel that is the subject of the pending sale, or the property as a whole, shall not be transferred pursuant to item (2) on July 1, 2015. The State Ports Authority shall have until midnight on December 31, 2015, to close the sale. If the sale is not closed by midnight on December 31, 2015, then the parcel, or the property as a whole, shall be transferred pursuant to item (2). (c) If the State Ports Authority has received a bona fide offer for a parcel of the property, or for the property as a whole, within ninety days prior to June 30, 2015, the transfer of the parcel that is the subject of the offer, or the property as a whole, shall not be transferred pursuant to item (2) on July 1, 2015. The State Ports Authority shall have until midnight on December 31, 2015, to close the sale. If the sale is not closed by midnight on December 31, 2015, then the parcel, or the property as a whole, shall be transferred pursuant to item (2). (2)(a) Except as provided in subsection(C)(1)(b) and (c), on July 1, 2015, the property must be irrevocably transferred to the Division of General Services in the Department of Administration, as established by Act 121 of 2014, for sale at public auction. Upon the transfer of the property to General Services, the Department of Administration is vested with all of the board's fiduciary duties to the authority and the authority's bondholders. (b) Sale of the property pursuant to this section, and in an amount permitted by item (3), shall satisfy the board's fiduciary duties to the authority and the authority's bondholders. (3) The State Ports Authority and General Services may accept a sales price on any parcel of the property, or the property as a whole, that is equal to, or greater than, eighty percent of the appraised value of the property to be sold. General Services may deduct from the proceeds of the sale an amount equal to the actual costs incurred in conjunction with the sale of the property. The balance of the proceeds must be transmitted to the authority. The Town of Port Royal or Beaufort County, or a combination of the two, may purchase the property at a price within the parameters established in this item. (D) Any real or personal property at Port Royal which is to be sold must be appraised prior to the sale. The real property appraiser must be a State Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI), and must be knowledgeable in appraisal and in appraising closed industrial sites. The appraisal of the real property should include its future development opportunities and those of the surrounding properties, and give due consideration to the possible existence of adverse environmental conditions and structurally unsound improvements. The sale of the real property shall comply with all state laws and procedures. All proceeds from the sale of real and personal property at Port Royal must be retained by the State Ports Authority, except as provided in subsection (C)(3), and except that the Town of Port Royal may petition the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, or its successor entity, for a portion of the net proceeds from a sale and may be allocated a portion of these net proceeds in an amount not to exceed five percent of the net proceeds upon showing the allocation is necessary to pay for infrastructure needs directly associated with and necessitated by the closing of the port as Port Royal. These funds must be expended at the direction of the Town Council of Port Royal with the approval of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, or its successor entity, solely for infrastructure, and shall have priority over all other expenditures except usual and necessary closing costs attributable to a sales contract.
