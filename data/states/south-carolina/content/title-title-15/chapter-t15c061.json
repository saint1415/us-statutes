The nonpetitioning joint tenants or tenants in common shall be allowed to purchase the interests in the property as provided in this section whether default has been entered against them or not. (B) In the circumstances described in subsection (A) of this section, and in the event the parties cannot reach agreement as to the price, the value of the interest or interests to be sold shall be determined by one or more competent real estate appraisers, as the court shall approve, appointed for that purpose by the court.

An evidentiary hearing limited to the proposed valuation of the interests of the petitioning joint tenants or tenants in common shall be conducted, and an order as to the valuation of the interests of the petitioning joint tenants or tenants in common shall be issued. (D) After the valuation of the interest in property is completed as provided in subsection (B) or (C) of this section, the nonpetitioning joint tenants or tenants in common seeking to purchase the interests of those filing the petition shall have forty-five days to pay into the court the price set as the value of those interests to be purchased. Upon the payment and approval of it by the court, the court shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered the proper instruments transferring title to the purchasers.

(3) If one or more but not all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court, on motion, shall order the party so moving to give notice to the electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest remaining and the price for all the interests. (F) Not later than twenty days after notice is sent pursuant to subsection (E)(3), any cotenant who paid may elect to purchase all of the remaining interest by paying the entire price into the court. After an additional twenty-day period, the following requirements apply: (1) If only one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interests, the court shall issue an order reallocating the remaining interests to that cotenant and disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them. (2) If no cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interests, the court shall resolve the partition action pursuant to Section 15-61-380, as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased. (3) If more than one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interests, the court shall reapportion the remaining interests among those paying cotenants, based on each paying cotenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interests. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating all of the cotenants' interests, disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them, and promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.

(H) If the court receives a timely request under subsection (G), the court, after a hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations: (1) A sale authorized under this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under subsections (A) through (F) have been paid into court and those interests have been reallocated among the cotenants as provided in those subsections. (2) The purchase price for the interest of a nonappearing cotenant is based on the court's determination of value pursuant to Section 15-61-360.

In considering whether to order partition in kind or partition by allotment, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated. (B) If the court does not order partition in kind or partition by allotment under subsection (A), the court shall order partition by sale pursuant to Section 15-61-400 or, if no cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action. (C) If the court orders partition in kind or partition by allotment pursuant to subsection (A), the court may require that one or more cotenants pay one or more of the other cotenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions to the cotenants, will make the partition in kind or the partition by allotment just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.

(B) The court may not consider any one factor in subsection (A) to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.

(B) If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later than thirty days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in this State to offer the property for sale, the court, upon consultation with the parties, shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in this State to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission. The broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the terms and conditions established by the court. (C) If a broker appointed under subsection (B) obtains within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value: (1) the broker shall comply with the reporting requirements in Section 15-61-410; (2) the sale may be completed in accordance with state law other than this article; and (3) the commission of the real estate broker must be paid from the proceeds of the sale. (D) If the broker appointed under subsection (B) does not obtain within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value, the court, after a hearing, may: (1) approve the highest outstanding offer, if any; (2) redetermine the value of the property and order that the property continue to be offered for an additional time; or (3) order that the property be sold by sealed bids or at an auction. (E) If the court orders a sale by sealed bids or an auction, the court shall set terms and conditions of the sale. If the court orders an auction, the auction must be conducted pursuant to procedures governing judicial sales and auctions. (F) If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the proceeds.
