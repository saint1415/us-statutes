(b) On application, the court may stay an arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened on a showing that there is no agreement to arbitrate.

If found for the opposing party, the court shall order the parties to proceed to arbitration. (c) If an issue referable to arbitration under the alleged agreement is involved in an action or proceeding pending in a court having jurisdiction to hear applications under subdivision (a) of this section, the application shall be made therein. Otherwise and subject to Section 15-48-190, the application may be made in any court of competent jurisdiction. (d) Any action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration shall be stayed if an order for arbitration or an application therefor has been made under this section or, if the issue is severable, the stay may be with respect thereto only.
