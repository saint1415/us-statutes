The selection, use, and reimbursement of interpreters must be determined under such guidelines as may be established by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. All fees for interpreting services must be paid out of the general fund of the State from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department for this purpose by the General Assembly.\n\n(B) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"Qualified interpreter\" means a person eighteen years of age or older who has been certified by the South Carolina Association of the Deaf Interpreter Assessment Program (SCAD-IAP Level IV or V) or the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf and who has received approval from the South Carolina Association of the Deaf and who is not a family member of the deaf person.\n\n(2) \"Deaf person\" means a person who cannot use his hearing for communication purposes.\n\n(C) In an action where the mental condition of a deaf person is being considered and where the person may be committed to an institution, all the court proceedings pertaining to the person must be interpreted to the deaf person in a language that the person understands by a qualified interpreter appointed by the court.\n\nHISTORY: 1987 Act No. 97 Section 1; 1996 Act No. 365, Section 1; 1998 Act No. 390, Section 3; 2001 Act No. 103, Section 1.",
