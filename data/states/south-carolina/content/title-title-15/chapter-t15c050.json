The provisions of this subsection do not prevent a structured settlement purchase company from paying: (a) a commission or finder's fee to a person who is a structured settlement purchase company or is an employee of a structured settlement purchase company; (b) to third parties, any routine transfer expenses including, without limitation, court filing fees, escrow fees, lien recordation fees, judgment and lien search fees, attorney's fees and other similar types of fees relating to a transfer; (6) intentionally advertise materially false or misleading information regarding its products or services; (7) attempt to coerce, bribe, or intimidate a payee seeking to transfer structured settlement payment rights, including providing any gift, loan, extension of credit, advance, or other forms of consideration paid to or given to the payee as an inducement to enter a transfer agreement; (8) attempt to defraud a payee or any party to a structured settlement transfer or any interested party in a structured settlement transfer proceeding by any means including, but not limited to, forgery or false identification; (9) except as otherwise provided in this chapter, intervene in a pending structured settlement transfer proceeding if the transferee or structured settlement purchase company is not a party to the proceeding or an interested party relative to the proposed transfer which is the subject of the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding. The provisions of this chapter do not prevent a structured settlement purchase company from intervening in a pending structured settlement transfer proceeding if the payee has signed a transfer agreement with the structured settlement purchase company within sixty days before the filing of the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding and the structured settlement purchase company which filed the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding violated any provision of this chapter in connection with the proposed transfer that is the subject of the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding; (10) except as otherwise provided in this chapter, knowingly contact a payee who has signed a transfer agreement and is pursuing a proposed transfer with another structured settlement purchase company for the purpose of inducing the payee into canceling the proposed transfer or transfer agreement with the other structured settlement purchase company if a structured settlement transfer proceeding has been filed by the other structured settlement purchase company and is pending. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if a hearing has not been held in the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding within ninety days after the filing of the pending structured settlement transfer proceeding; (11) fail to dismiss a pending structured settlement transfer proceeding at the request of the payee. A dismissal of a structured settlement proceeding after a structured settlement purchase company has violated the provisions of this clause does not exempt the structured settlement purchase company from any liability under this section; (12) solicit a prospective payee through the conveyance of a document which resembles a check or other form of payment; (13) provide a transfer agreement or related document that purports to give the transferee the first choice or option to purchase any remaining structured settlement payment rights belonging to the payee which are not subject to the structured settlement transfer proceeding; or (14) communicate with a payee, a prospective payee, or a person associated with the payee: (a) after the payee, a prospective payee, or a person associated with the payee has informed the structured settlement purchase company to cease further communication; (b) at any unusual time, or at a time that the structured settlement purchase company knows is inconvenient to the consumer. In the absence of the structured settlement purchase company's knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a time before 8:00 a.m. and after 9:00 p.m. local time at the consumer's location is inconvenient. This subsection will not apply to any payee, prospective payee, or person associated with the payee who has opted in and agreed to allow the structured settlement purchase company to contact the person when necessary; or (c) repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass a payee, prospective payee, or a person associated with the payee. (B) A transferee or structured settlement purchase company and an employee or other representative of a transferee or structured settlement purchase company shall not instruct a payee to hire, or directly refer a payee or a prospective payee to seek independent professional advice from, a specific person, except that a structured settlement purchase company may refer a payee to a state or local referral service, bar association, legal aid, or any other entity unrelated to the structured settlement purchase company. A person rendering independent professional advice to a payee or prospective payee is not to be affected by whether a transfer occurs or does not occur and must not in any manner be affiliated with or compensated by the transferee or a structured settlement purchase company unless ordered by the court. (C) A payee may file a motion in the court in which the structured settlement transfer proceeding is pending alleging a violation of subsection (A) and may pursue all rights and remedies to which the payee may be entitled under this chapter or any other applicable law. (D) A structured settlement purchase company may file a motion in the court in which the structured settlement transfer proceeding is pending to enforce items in subsection (A) and may pursue all remedies to which the structured settlement purchase company may be entitled pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law. (E) If a court finds that a structured settlement purchase company or transferee is in violation of this section, the court may: (1) revoke the registration of the structured settlement purchase company; (2) suspend the registration of the structured settlement purchase company for a period to be determined at the discretion of the court; and (3) enjoin the structured settlement purchase company or transferee from filing new structured settlement transfer proceedings in this State or otherwise pursuing transfers in this State.

(B) In determining whether a proposed transfer is in the best interest of the payee pursuant to subsection (A)(1), the courts must take into consideration the welfare and support of the payee and the payee's dependents, if any. The court must also consider: (1) the reasonable preference of the payee, in light of the payee's age, mental capacity, maturity level, understanding of the terms of the agreement, and stated purpose for the transfer; (2) if the periodic payments were intended to cover future income or losses or future medical expenses, whether the payee has means of support aside from the structured settlement to meet these obligations; (3) whether the payee can meet the financial needs of, and obligations to, the payee's dependents if the transfer is allowed to proceed, including child support and spousal maintenance; (4) whether the payee completed previous transactions involving the payee's structured settlement payment rights, and the timing, amount, stated purpose, and actual use of the proceeds; (5) the impact of the proposed transfer on current or future eligibility of the payee or the payee's dependents for public benefits; and (6) any other factors or facts the court determines to be relevant. (C) No direct or indirect transfer of a payee's structured settlement payment rights by a payee's conservator, if a conservator has been appointed, shall be effective and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer shall be required to make a payment directly or indirectly to a transferee or assignee of structured settlement payment rights unless, in addition to the findings required under this section, the court also finds that the proceeds of the proposed transfer would be applied solely for the benefit of the payee. (D) No direct or indirect transfer of a minor's structured settlement payment rights by a parent, conservator, or guardian shall be effective and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer shall be required to make a payment directly or indirectly to a transferee or assignee of structured settlement payment rights unless, in addition to the findings required under this section, the court also finds that: (1) the proceeds of the proposed transfer would be applied solely for support, care, education, health, and welfare of the minor payee; and (2) any excess proceeds would be preserved for the future support, care, education, health, and welfare of the minor payee and transferred to the minor payee upon emancipation.
