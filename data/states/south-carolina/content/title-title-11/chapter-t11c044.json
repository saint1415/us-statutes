Approval of this registration constitutes certification by the Secretary for twelve months after being issued.

(B) If the Secretary finds that any information contained in an application of a business for registration under this chapter is false, the Secretary shall revoke the registration of the business. The Secretary shall not revoke the registration of a business only because it ceases business operations for an indefinite period of time, as long as the business renews its registration. (C) A registration as a qualified business may not be sold or otherwise transferred, except that, if a qualified business enters into a merger, conversion, consolidation, or other similar transaction with another business and the surviving company would otherwise meet the criteria for being a qualified business, the surviving company retains the registration for the twelve-month registration period without further application to the Secretary. In this case, the qualified business shall provide the Secretary with written notice of the merger, conversion, consolidation, or similar transaction and other information as required by the Secretary.

(3) \"Net capital gain\" is as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 1222 and related sections. (4) \"Net capital loss\" is as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 1211(b), not including the limitation imposed pursuant to Section 1211(b)(1). (B)(1) If an angel investor taxpayer recognized net capital gain on the sale or exchange of credit assets in a taxable year, then the amount of net capital gain of that taxpayer eligible for the deduction otherwise allowed pursuant to Section 12-6-1150 must be reduced by the net capital gain on the sale or exchange of credit assets by the angel investor taxpayer. (2) In a separate computation in each taxable year the angel investor taxpayer shall attribute the net capital gain on credit assets to each credit asset in the ratio that the long term capital gain on each separate credit asset as a proportion of all such long term gain bears to the net capital gain reduction required pursuant to item (1). If cumulative net capital gain on a credit asset multiplied by seven percent equals the total credit claimed on the credit asset, the excess of the net capital gain attributable to this credit asset over that necessary to produce the total credit amount in the computation is deducted from the reduction otherwise required pursuant to item (1). (C)(1) If an angel investor taxpayer recognized net capital loss on the sale or exchange of credit assets in a taxable year in an amount equal to or less than the total of tax credits claimed on those credit assets, then there is added to the angel investor taxpayer's South Carolina taxable income for that taxable year the amount of the net capital loss on those credit assets not to exceed the tax credits claimed on those credit assets. (2) If an angel investor taxpayer recognized net capital loss on the sale or exchange of credit assets in a taxable year in an amount greater than the amount of the tax credits claimed on those credit assets, then there is added to the angel investor taxpayer's South Carolina taxable income for that taxable year the amount of the tax credit claimed on those credit assets.
