This code applies to every procurement or expenditure of funds by this State under contract acting through a governmental body as herein defined irrespective of the source of the funds, including federal assistance monies, except as specified in Section 11-35-40(3) (Compliance with Federal Requirements) and except that this code does not apply to gifts, to the issuance of grants, or to contracts between public procurement units, except as provided in Article 19 (Intergovernmental Relations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article 23 (Statewide Provisions) apply as provided therein. It also shall apply to the disposal of state supplies as provided in Article 15 (Supply Management). No state agency or subdivision thereof may sell, lease, or otherwise alienate or obligate telecommunications and information technology infrastructure of the State by temporary proviso and unless provided for in the general laws of the State.\n\n(3) Compliance with Federal Requirements. Where a procurement involves the expenditure of federal assistance, grant, or contract funds, the governmental body also shall comply with federal laws (including authorized regulations) as are mandatorily applicable and which are not presently reflected in this code; however, failure to comply with the foregoing is not subject to review under Article 17. Notwithstanding, where federal assistance, grant, or contract funds are used in a procurement by a governmental body as defined in Section 11-35-310(18), this code, including any requirements that are more restrictive than federal requirements, must be followed, except to the extent such action would render the governmental body ineligible to receive federal funds whose receipt is conditioned on compliance with mandatorily applicable federal law. In those circumstances, the solicitation must identify and explain the impact of such federal laws on the procurement process, including any required deviation from this code.\n\n(4) The acquisition of a facility or capital improvement by a foundation or eleemosynary organization on behalf of or for the use of any state agency or institution of higher learning which involves the use of public funds in the acquisition, financing, construction, or current or subsequent leasing of the facility or capital improvement is subject to the provisions of this code in the same manner as a governmental body. The definition and application of the terms \"acquisition\", \"financing\", \"construction\", and \"leasing\" are governed by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n(5) The licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission to Greenville Technical College and Trident Technical College authorizing the use of the band of the Educational Broadband Service spectrum are exempt from the requirements of this code. If Greenville Technical College and Trident Technical College enter into contracts with third parties to lease their spectrum capacity, Greenville Technical College and Trident Technical College must not impose any pricing requirements on those third parties. Any lease agreements with third parties must be designed so that Greenville Technical College and Trident Technical College receive the market rate for the spectrum capacity.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 170, Part II, Section 42; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2005 Act No. 164, Section 11; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 4; 2007 Act No. 110, Section 5; 2008 Act No. 208, Section 1; 2009 Act No. 72, Section 3; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 3, eff May 13, 2019.",

      "text": "(1) Condition for Use. Contracts must be awarded by competitive sealed bidding except as otherwise provided in Section 11-35-1510.\n\n(2) Invitation for Bids. An invitation for bids must be issued in an efficient and economical manner and must include specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement.\n\n(3) Notice. Adequate notice of the invitation for bids must be given at a reasonable time before the date set forth in it for the opening of bids. The notice must include publications in \"South Carolina Business Opportunities\". Governmental bodies may charge vendors the cost incurred for copying and mailing bid or proposal documents requested in response to a procurement.\n\n(4) Receipt and Safeguarding of Bids. All bids, including modifications, received before the time of opening must be kept secure and unopened, except as provided by regulation of the board.\n\n(5) Bid Opening. Bids must be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses, at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids and in the manner prescribed by regulation of the board. The amount of each bid, and other relevant information as may be specified by regulation, together with the name of each bidder, must be tabulated. The tabulation must be open to public inspection at that time.\n\n(6) Bid Acceptance and Bid Evaluation. Bids must be accepted unconditionally without alteration or correction, except as otherwise authorized in this code. The invitation for bids must set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. Criteria must not be used in bid evaluation that are not in the invitation for bids. Bids must be evaluated based on the requirements in the invitation for bids and in accordance with the regulations of the board.\n\n(7) Correction or Withdrawal of Bids; Cancellation of Awards. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after award, or cancellation and re-award of awards or contracts, after award but before performance, may be permitted in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board. After bid opening, changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the State or fair competition must not be permitted. After opening, bids must not be corrected or withdrawn except in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulations promulgated pursuant to it. Except as otherwise provided by regulation, all decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts, after award but before performance, must be supported by a written determination of appropriateness made by the chief procurement officers or head of a purchasing agency.\n\n(8) Reserved.\n\n(9) Tie Bids. If two or more bidders are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the required conditions, awards are determined in the following order of priority:\n\n(a) If there is a South Carolina firm tied with an out-of-state firm, the award must be made automatically to the South Carolina firm.\n\n(b) Tie bids involving South Carolina produced or manufactured products, when known, and items produced or manufactured out of the State must be resolved in favor of the South Carolina commodity.\n\n(c) Tie bids involving a business certified by the South Carolina Office of Small and Minority Business Assistance as a Minority Business Enterprise must be resolved in favor of the Minority Business Enterprise.\n\n(d) Tie bids involving South Carolina firms must be resolved in favor of the South Carolina firm located in the same taxing jurisdiction as the governmental body's consuming location.\n\n(e) In all other situations in which bids are tied, the award must be made to the tied bidder offering the quickest delivery time, or if the tied bidders have offered the same delivery time, the tie must be resolved by the flip of a coin witnessed by the procurement officer. All responding vendors must be invited to attend.\n\n(10) Award. Unless there is a compelling reason to reject bids as prescribed by regulation of the board, notice of an award or an intended award of a contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidders whose bid meets the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids must be given by posting the notice on the date and at a location specified in the invitation for bids. For contracts with a total or potential value in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, notice of an intended award of a contract must be given by posting the notice for seven business days before entering into a contract and must be sent electronically to all bidders responding to the solicitation on the same day that the notice is posted in accordance with this section. The posting date shall appear on the face of all these notices. If a change to the posting date is necessary, notice of the revised posting date must be given by posting the notice for three business days at the location identified in the solicitation and must be sent electronically to all bidders responding to the solicitation on the same day that the notice is posted in accordance with this section. The invitation for bids and a notice of award or notice of intent to award must contain a statement of a bidder's right to protest pursuant to Section 11-35-4210(1). When only one response is received, the notice of intent to award and the delay of award may be waived.\n\n(11) Request for Qualifications.\n\n(a) Before soliciting bids, the procurement officer, may issue a request for qualifications from prospective bidders. The request must contain, at a minimum, a description of the scope of work to be solicited by the invitation for bids, the deadline for submission of information, and how prospective bidders may apply for consideration. The request must require information concerning the prospective bidders' product specifications, qualifications, experience, and ability to perform the requirements of the contract. Adequate public notice of the request for qualifications must be given in the manner provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(b) After receipt of the responses to the request for qualifications from prospective bidders, the rank of the prospective bidders must be determined in writing from most qualified to least qualified on the basis of the information provided. Bids then must be solicited from at least the top two prospective bidders by means of an invitation for bids. The determination regarding how many bids to solicit is not subject to review under Article 17.\n\n(12) Reserved.\n\n(13) Minor Informalities and Irregularities in Bids. A minor informality or irregularity is one which is merely a matter of form or is some immaterial variation from the exact requirements of the invitation for bids having no effect or merely a trivial or negligible effect on total bid price, quality, quantity, or delivery of the supplies or performance of the contract, and the correction or waiver of which would not be prejudicial to bidders. The procurement officer shall either give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive any such deficiency when it is to the advantage of the State. Such communication or determination shall be in writing. Examples of minor informalities or irregularities include, but are not limited to:\n\n(a) failure of a bidder to return the number of copies of signed bids required by the solicitation;\n\n(b) failure of a bidder to furnish the required information concerning the number of the bidder's employees or failure to make a representation concerning its size;\n\n(c) failure of a bidder to sign its bid, but only if the firm submitting the bid has formally adopted or authorized the execution of documents by typewritten, printed, or rubber stamped signature and submits evidence of that authorization, and the bid carries that signature or the unsigned bid is accompanied by other material indicating the bidder's intention to be bound by the unsigned document, such as the submission of a bid guarantee with the bid or a letter signed by the bidder with the bid referring to and identifying the bid itself;\n\n(d) failure of a bidder to acknowledge receipt of an amendment to a solicitation, but only if:\n\n(i) the bid received indicates in some way that the bidder received the amendment, such as where the amendment added another item to the solicitation and the bidder submitted a bid, on it, if the bidder states under oath that it received the amendment before bidding and that the bidder will stand by its bid price; or\n\n(ii) the amendment has no effect on price or quantity or merely a trivial or negligible effect on quality or delivery, and is not prejudicial to bidders, such as an amendment correcting a typographical mistake in the name of the governmental body;\n\n(e) failure of a bidder to furnish an affidavit concerning affiliates;\n\n(f) failure of a bidder to execute the certifications with respect to equal opportunity and affirmative action programs;\n\n(g) failure of a bidder to furnish cut sheets or product literature;\n\n(h) failure of a bidder to furnish certificates of insurance;\n\n(i) failure of a bidder to furnish financial statements;\n\n(j) failure of a bidder to furnish references;\n\n(k) failure of a bidder to furnish its bidder number; and\n\n(l) notwithstanding Title 40, the failure of a bidder to indicate his contractor's license number or other evidence of licensure, except that a contract must not be awarded to the bidder unless and until the bidder is properly licensed under the laws of South Carolina.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1986 Act No. 510, Section 2; 1992 Act No. 442, Section 2; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 21; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 95; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 25; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 18, eff May 13, 2019.",

      "text": "(A) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"End product\" means the tangible product described in the solicitation including all component parts and in final form and ready for the state's intended use.\n\n(2) \"Grown\" means to produce, cultivate, raise, or harvest timber, agricultural produce, or livestock on the land, or to cultivate, raise, catch, or harvest products or food from the water which results in an end product that is locally derived from the product cultivated, raised, caught, or harvested.\n\n(3) \"Labor cost\" means salary and fringe benefits.\n\n(4) \"Made\" means to assemble, fabricate, or process component parts into an end product, the value of which, assembly, fabrication, or processing is a substantial portion of the price of the end product.\n\n(5) \"Manufactured\" means to make or process raw materials into an end product.\n\n(6) \"Office\" means a nonmobile place for the regular transaction of business or performance of a particular service which has been operated as such by the bidder for at least one year before the bid opening and during that year the place has been staffed for at least fifty weeks by at least two employees for at least thirty-five hours a week each.\n\n(7) \"Services\" means services as defined by Section 11-35-310(29) and also includes services as defined in Section 11-35-310(1)(d).\n\n(8) \"South Carolina end product\" means an end product made, manufactured, or grown in South Carolina.\n\n(9) \"United States end product\" means an end product made, manufactured, or grown in the United States of America.\n\n(B)(1) When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination, the procurement officer shall decrease by seven percent the price of any offer for a South Carolina end product.\n\n(2) When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination, the procurement officer shall decrease by two percent the price of any offer for a United States end product. This preference does not apply to an item to which the South Carolina end product preference has been applied.\n\n(3) Whether award is to be made by item or lot, the preferences must be applied to the price of each line item of end product. A preference must not be applied to an item for which a bidder does not qualify.\n\n(4) If a contract is awarded to a bidder that received the award as a result of the South Carolina end product or United States end product preference, the contractor may not substitute a nonqualifying end product for a qualified end product. A substitution in violation of this item is grounds for debarment pursuant to Section 11-35-4220. If a contractor violates this provision, the State may terminate the contract for cause and, in addition, the contractor shall pay to the State an amount equal to twice the difference between the price paid by the State and the bidder's evaluated price for a substituted item.\n\n(5) If a bidder is requesting this preference, the bidder, upon request of the procurement officer, must provide documentation that establishes the bidder's qualifications for the preference. Bidder's failure to provide this information promptly is grounds to deny the preference and for enforcement pursuant to subsection (E)(6).\n\n(C)(1) When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination, the procurement officer shall decrease a bidder's price by seven percent if the bidder maintains an office in this State and either (i) maintains at a location in South Carolina at the time of the bid an inventory of expendable items which are representative of the general type of commodities on which the award will be made and which have a minimum total value, based on the bid price, equal to the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or the annual amount of the contract; (ii) is a manufacturer headquartered and having an annual payroll of at least one million dollars in South Carolina and the end product is made or processed from raw materials into a finished end product by that manufacturer or its affiliate (as defined in Section 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code); or (iii) at the time of bidding, directly employs or has a documented commitment with individuals domiciled in South Carolina that will perform services expressly required by the solicitation and the total direct labor cost to bidder for those individuals to provide those services exceeds fifty percent of the bidder's total bid price.\n\n(2) Whether award is to be made by item or lot, the preferences must be applied to the price of each line item of end product or work, as applicable. A preference must not be applied to an item for which a bidder does not qualify.\n\n(3) If a bidder is requesting this preference, the bidder, upon request by the procurement officer, must provide documentation that establishes the bidder's qualifications for the preference and, for the preference claimed pursuant to subsection (C)(1)(iii), must identify the persons domiciled in South Carolina that will perform the services involved in the procurement upon which bidder relies in qualifying for the preference, the services those individuals are to perform, and documentation of the bidder's labor cost for each person identified. Bidder's failure to provide this information promptly is grounds to deny the preference and for enforcement under subsection (E)(6) below.\n\n(D)(1) When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination, the procurement officer shall decrease a bidder's price by two percent if:\n\n(a) the bidder has a documented commitment from a single proposed first-tier subcontractor to perform some portion of the services expressly required by the solicitation; and\n\n(b) at the time of the bidding, the subcontractor directly employs or has a documented commitment with individuals domiciled in South Carolina that will perform services expressly required by the solicitation and the total direct labor cost to the subcontractor for those individuals to provide those services exceeds twenty percent of bidder's total bid price.\n\n(2) When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination, the procurement officer shall decrease a bidder's price by four percent if:\n\n(a) the bidder has a documented commitment from a single proposed first-tier subcontractor to perform some portion of the services expressly required by the solicitation; and\n\n(b) at the time of the bidding, the subcontractor directly employs or has a documented commitment with individuals domiciled in South Carolina that will perform services expressly required by the solicitation and the total direct labor cost to the subcontractor for those individuals to provide those services exceeds forty percent of bidder's total bid price.\n\n(3) Whether award is to be made by item or lot, the preferences must be applied to the price of each line item of work. A preference must not be applied to an item for which a bidder does not qualify.\n\n(4) Subject to other limits in this section, an offeror may benefit from applying for more than one of, or from multiple applications of, the preferences allowed by items (1) and (2).\n\n(5)(a) In its bid, a bidder requesting any of the preferences allowed by items (1) and (2) must identify the subcontractor to perform the work, the work the subcontractor is to perform, and the bidder's factual basis for concluding that the subcontractor's work constitutes the required percentage of the work to be performed in the procurement.\n\n(b) If a bidder is requesting a preference allowed by items (1) or (2), upon request by the procurement officer, the bidder shall identify the persons domiciled in South Carolina that are to perform the services involved in the procurement upon which the bidder relies in qualifying for the preference, the services those individuals are to perform, the employer of those persons, the bidder's relationship with the employer, and documentation of the subcontractor's labor cost for each person identified. Bidder's failure to provide this information promptly will be grounds to deny the preference and for enforcement pursuant to subsection (E)(6) below.\n\n(c) If a contract is awarded to a bidder that received the award as a result of a preference allowed by items (1) or (2), the contractor may not substitute any business for the subcontractor on which the bidder relied to qualify for the preference, unless first approved in writing by the procurement officer. A substitution in violation of this subitem is grounds for debarment pursuant to Section 11-35-4220. If a contractor violates this provision, the procurement officer may terminate the contract for cause. If the contract is not terminated, the procurement officer may require the contractor to pay the State an amount equal to twice the difference between the price paid by the State and the price offered by the next lowest bidder, unless the substituted subcontractor qualifies for the preference.\n\n(E)(1) A business is not entitled to any preferences unless the business, to the extent required by law, has:\n\n(a) paid all taxes assessed by the State; and\n\n(b) registered with the South Carolina Secretary of State and the South Carolina Department of Revenue.\n\n(2) The preferences provided in subsections (B) and (C)(1)(i) and (ii) do not apply to a single unit of an item with a price in excess of fifty thousand dollars or a single award with a total potential value in excess of five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(3) The preferences provided in subsections (C)(1)(iii) and (D) do not apply to a bid for an item of work by the bidder if the annual price of the bidder's work exceeds fifty thousand dollars or the total potential price of the bidder's work exceeds five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(4) A solicitation must provide potential bidders an opportunity to request the preferences that apply to a procurement. By submitting a bid and requesting that a preference be applied to that bid, a business certifies that its bid qualifies for the preference for that procurement. For purposes of applying this section, a bidder is not qualified for a preference unless the bidder makes a request for the preference as required in the solicitation. If a solicitation specifies which preferences, if any, apply to a procurement, the applicability of preferences to that procurement is conclusively determined by the solicitation unless the solicitation document is timely protested as provided in Section 11-35-4210. If two or more bidders are tied after the application of the preferences allowed by this section, the tie must be resolved as provided in Section 11-35-1520(9). Price adjustments required by this section for purposes of evaluation and application of the preferences do not change the actual price offered by the bidder.\n\n(5) This section does not apply to an acquisition of motor vehicles as defined in Section 56-15-10 or an acquisition of supplies or services relating to construction. This section does not apply to a procurement conducted pursuant to Section 11-35-1550(2)(a) or (b), Section 11-35-1530, or Article 9, Chapter 35.\n\n(6) Pursuant to Section 11-35-4220, a business may be debarred if (i) the business certified that it qualified for a preference, (ii) the business is not qualified for the preference claimed, and (iii) the certification was made in bad faith or under false pretenses. If a contractor has invalidly certified that a preference is applicable, the chief procurement officer may terminate the contract for cause, and the chief procurement officer may require the contractor to pay the State an amount equal to twice the difference between the price paid by the State and the price offered by the next lowest bidder.\n\n(7) The sum of all preferences allowed by items (D)(1) and (D)(2), when applied to the price of a line item of work, may not exceed six percent unless the bidder maintains an office in this State. Under no circumstances may the cumulative preferences applied to the price of a line item exceed ten percent.\n\n(8) As used in items (C)(1)(iii), (D)(1)(b), and (D)(2)(b), the term \"documented commitment\" means a written commitment by the bidder to employ directly an individual, and by the individual to be employed by the bidder, both contingent on the bidder receiving the award.\n\n(9) The remedies available in this section are cumulative of and in addition to all other remedies available at law and equity.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2002 Act No. 333, Section 10; 2009 Act No. 72, Section 2.",

The purpose of fixed price bidding is to provide multiple sources of supply for specific services, supplies, or information technology based on a preset maximum price which the State will pay for such services, supplies, or information technology.\n\n(3) Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the solicitation shall be given in the same manner as provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(4) Pricing.

The purpose of best value bidding is to allow factors other than price to be considered in the determination of award for specific supplies, services, or information technology based on pre-determined criteria identified by the State.\n\n(3) Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the request for the solicitation shall be given in the same manner as provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(4) Bid Opening. At bid opening, the only information that will be released is the names of the participating bidders. Price information will be provided after the ranking of bidders and the issuance of award.\n\n(5) Evaluation Factors. The best value bid must state the factors to be used in determination of award and the numerical weighting for each factor. Price must be a factor in determination of award and cannot be weighted at less than sixty percent. Best value bid evaluation factors may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:\n\n(a) operational costs the State would incur if the bid is accepted;\n\n(b) quality of the product or service or its technical competency;\n\n(c) reliability of delivery and implementation schedules;\n\n(d) maximum facilitation of data exchange and systems integration;\n\n(e) warranties, guarantees, and return policy;\n\n(f) vendor financial stability;\n\n(g) consistency of the proposed solution with the state's planning documents and announced strategic program direction;\n\n(h) quality and effectiveness of business solution and approach;\n\n(i) industry and program experience;\n\n(j) prior record of vendor performance;\n\n(k) vendor expertise with engagement of similar scope and complexity;\n\n(l) extent and quality of the proposed participation and acceptance by all user groups;\n\n(m) proven development methodologies and tools; and\n\n(n) innovative use of current technologies and quality results.\n\n(6) Clarification of Responsive Bid. The procurement officer may ask a responsive bidder to clarify an ambiguity in its bid; however, no material modification of the bid is allowed.\n\n(7) Selection and Ranking. Bids shall be evaluated by using only the criteria and weightings stated in the invitation for best value bids. All evaluation factors, other than price, will be considered independent of and prior to determining the effect of price on the score for each participating bidder. Once the evaluation is complete, all responsive bidders must be ranked from most advantageous to least advantageous to the State, considering only the evaluation factors stated in the invitation for best value bids.\n\n(8) Award.

Adequate public notice of the request for the solicitation must be given in the same manner as provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(3) Bidding Process. The solicitation must designate both an Opening Date and Time and a Closing Date and Time. The Closing Date and Time need not be a fixed point in time, but may remain dependent on a variable specified in the solicitation. At the Opening Date and Time, the State must begin accepting real-time electronic bids. The solicitation must remain open until the Closing Date and Time. Before the Opening Date and Time, the State shall require bidders to register, shall register only responsible bidders, and, as a part of that registration, require bidders to agree to any terms, conditions, or other requirements of the solicitation. If less than two bidders are registered, the solicitation must be canceled. Following receipt of the first bid after the Opening Date and Time, the lowest bid price must be posted electronically to the Internet and updated on a real-time basis. At any time before the Closing Date and Time, a bidder may lower the price of its bid, except that after Opening Date and Time, a bidder may not lower its price unless that price is below the then lowest bid. Bid prices may not be increased after Opening Date and Time. Except for bid prices, bids may be modified only as otherwise allowed by this code. A bid may be withdrawn only in compliance with Section 11-35-1520. If a bid is withdrawn, a later bid submitted by the same bidder may not be for a higher price. If the lowest responsive bid is withdrawn after the Closing Date and Time, the State may cancel the solicitation in accordance with this code or reopen electronic bidding to all pre-existing bidders by giving adequate notice to all pre-existing bidders of both the new Opening Date and Time and the new Closing Date and Time. Notice that electronic bidding will be reopened must be given as specified in the solicitation.\n\n(4) Receipt and Safeguarding of Bids.

      "text": "(1) Conditions for Use.\n\n(a) If the procurement officer determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the State, a contract may be entered into by competitive sealed proposals subject to the provisions of Section 11-35-1520 and the ensuing regulations, unless otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(b) The board may provide by regulation that it is either not practicable or not advantageous to the State to procure specified types of supplies, services, information technology, or construction by competitive sealed bidding.\n\n(2) Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the request for proposals must be given in the same manner as provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(3) Receipt of Proposals. Proposals must be opened publicly in accordance with regulations of the board. A tabulation of proposals must be prepared in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board and must be open for public inspection after contract award.\n\n(4) Request for Qualifications.\n\n(a) Before soliciting proposals, the procurement officer may issue a request for qualifications from prospective offerors. The request must contain at a minimum a description of the scope of the work to be solicited by the request for proposals and must state the deadline for submission of information and how prospective offerors may apply for consideration. The request must require information only on their qualifications, experience, and ability to perform the requirements of the contract.\n\n(b) After receipt of the responses to the request for qualifications from prospective offerors, rank of the prospective offerors must be determined in writing from most qualified to least qualified on the basis of the information provided. Proposals then must be solicited from at least the top two prospective offerors by means of a request for proposals. The determination regarding how many proposals to solicit is not subject to review pursuant to Article 17.\n\n(5) Evaluation Factors. The request for proposals must state the relative importance of the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals but may not require a numerical weighting for each factor. Price may, but need not, be an evaluation factor.\n\n(6) Discussion with Offerors. As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors must be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussions. In conducting discussions, there must be no disclosure of confidential information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. The board shall promulgate regulations governing discussions.\n\n(7) Selection and Ranking. Proposals must be evaluated using only the criteria stated in the request for proposals and there must be adherence to weightings that have been assigned previously. Once evaluation is complete, all responsive offerors must be ranked from most advantageous to least advantageous to the State, considering only the evaluation factors stated in the request for proposals.\n\n(8) Negotiations. After proposals have been ranked pursuant to Section 11-35-1530(7), the procurement officer, in his sole discretion and not subject to review under Article 17, may proceed in any of the manners indicated below, except that in no case may confidential information derived from proposals and negotiations submitted by competing offerors be disclosed:\n\n(a) negotiate with the highest ranking offeror on price, on matters affecting the scope of the contract, so long as the changes are within the general scope of the request for proposals, or on both. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the highest ranking offeror, negotiations may be conducted, in the sole discretion of the procurement officer, with the second, and then the third, and so on, ranked offerors to the level of ranking determined by the procurement officer in his sole discretion;\n\n(b) during the negotiation process as outlined in item (a) above, if the procurement officer is unsuccessful in his first round of negotiations, he may reopen negotiations with any offeror with whom he previously negotiated; or\n\n(c) before or after negotiations pursuant to Section 11-35-1530(8), the procurement officer may make changes to the request for proposals within the general scope of the request for proposals and may provide all responsive offerors an opportunity to submit their best and final offers, which must be reevaluated and ranked pursuant to Section 11-35-1530(7).\n\n(9) Award. Award must be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the State, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals, unless the procurement officer determines to utilize one of the options provided in Section 11-35-1530(8). The award of the contract must be made on the basis of evaluation factors that must be stated in the RFP. The contract file must contain the basis on which the award is made and must be sufficient to satisfy external audit. Procedures and requirements for the notification of intent to award the contract must be the same as those provided in Section 11-35-1520(10).\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1986 Act No. 510, Section 12; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 22; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 28; 2008 Act No. 174, Section 9; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 22, eff May 13, 2019.",

This section may not be used to acquire only commercially available off-the-shelf products.\n\n(3) Competitive negotiated acquisitions may be conducted only by the office of the appropriate chief procurement officer.\n\n(B) Definitions. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"Clarification\" means any communication in which the procurement officer requests or accepts information that clarifies any information in a proposal. Clarification does not include the request or acceptance of any change to the terms of a contractual offer.\n\n(2) \"Competitive range\" means the offeror or group of offerors selected for negotiation.\n\n(3) \"Negotiations\" means any communication that invites or permits an offeror to change the terms of its contractual offer in any way.\n\n(C) Request for qualifications. Offerors may be prequalified as provided in Section 11-35-1530(4).\n\n(D) Requests for proposals.\n\n(1)(a) Solicitations for competitive negotiations must be requests for proposals and must, at a minimum, describe:\n\n(i) the state's requirements;\n\n(ii) anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to the contract. The solicitation may authorize offerors to propose alternative terms and conditions, including alternative contract line items;\n\n(iii) information required to be in the offerors proposal; and\n\n(iv) evaluation factors.\n\n(b) The request for proposals must state the relative importance of all factors to be considered in evaluating proposals but need not state a numerical weighting for each factor. Except as provided by regulation, past performance and price must be evaluated. If price is an evaluation factor, the solicitation must state whether all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than price.\n\n(2) Amendments. Amendments issued after the established time and date for receipt of proposals may not exceed the general scope of the request for proposals and must be issued to those offerors that have not been eliminated from the competition.\n\n(E) Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the request for proposals must be given in the same manner as provided in Section 11-35-1520(3).\n\n(F) Receipt of Proposals. Proposals must be opened in accordance with regulations of the board. A tabulation of proposals must be prepared in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board and must be open for public inspection after contract award.\n\n(G) Evaluation. Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror's ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. All proposals must be evaluated and, after evaluation, their relative qualities must be assessed solely on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation. The relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation must be documented in the contract file.\n\n(H) Competitive Range. After complying with subsection (G), the procurement officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of the offerors that submitted the most promising offers. Ordinarily, the competitive range should not include more than three offerors. The procurement officer may select only one offeror and may select more than three. The procurement officer shall document the rationale for the selections.\n\n(I) Exchanges with Offerors.\n\n(1) Fairness and impartiality. The procurement officer shall treat all offerors fairly and impartially when deciding whether and when to seek clarification or to negotiate. Similarly situated offerors must be given similar opportunities to clarify and, if in the competitive range, to negotiate.\n\n(2) Clarifications. The procurement officer may conduct clarifications at any time before the award decision.\n\n(3) Negotiations.\n\n(a) The procurement officer shall negotiate with each offeror in the competitive range. The primary objective is to maximize the state's ability to obtain best value, based on the requirements and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Subject to item (1), the scope and extent of negotiations are a matter of the procurement officer's judgement.\n\n(b)(i) At a minimum, the procurement officer shall identify and seek the elimination of any term of a contractual offer that does not conform to a material requirement of a solicitation and any other undesirable terms in a contractual offer.\n\n(ii) The procurement officer may negotiate with offerors to seek changes in their contractual offers that the State desires and to allow them to make other improvements.\n\n(iii) Negotiations may include pricing.\n\n(iv) The procurement officer may not relax or change any material term of the solicitation during negotiation except by amendment.\n\n(v) In conducting negotiations, the procurement officer may not disclose confidential information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.\n\n(c) The procurement officer shall document the using agency's prenegotiation objectives with regard to each offeror in the competitive range and shall prepare a record of each negotiation session.\n\n(d) The procurement officer may eliminate an offeror from the competitive range after negotiation if the offeror is no longer considered to be among the most promising.\n\n(4) The board must promulgate regulations governing exchanges with offerors.\n\n(J) Proposal Revisions. The procurement officer may request or allow proposal revisions to clarify and document understandings reached during negotiations. If an offeror's proposal is eliminated or otherwise removed from the competitive range, no further revisions to that offeror's proposal may be accepted or considered. Upon the completion of negotiations, the contracting officer shall request that offerors still in the competitive range submit final proposals no later than a specified common cutoff date and time.\n\n(1) Award must be based on a comparative assessment of final proposals from offerors within the competitive range against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. Award must be made to the responsible offeror whose final proposal meets the announced requirements in all material respects and is determined in writing to provide the best value to the State, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals and, if price is an evaluation factor, any tradeoffs among price and non-price factors. As provided by regulation, the contract file must document the basis on which the award is made, and the documentation must explain and justify the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on in the award determination, including benefits associated with additional costs. Section 11-35-1524 does not apply.\n\n(2) Procedures and requirements for the notification of intent to award the contract must be the same as those provided in Section 11-35-1520(1).\n\nHISTORY: 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 23, eff May 13, 2019.",

Procurement requirements must not be artificially divided by governmental bodies so as to constitute a small purchase pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) Competition and Price Reasonableness.\n\n(a) No Competition. Small purchases not exceeding ten thousand dollars may be accomplished without securing competitive quotations if the prices are considered reasonable. The purchasing office must annotate the purchase requisition: \"Price is fair and reasonable\" and sign. The purchases must be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. When practical, a quotation must be solicited from other than the previous supplier before placing a repeat order. The administrative cost of verifying the reasonableness of the price of purchase \"not in excess of\" may more than offset potential savings in detecting instances of overpricing. Action to verify the reasonableness of the price need be taken only when the procurement officer of the governmental body suspects that the price may not be reasonable, comparison to previous price paid, or personal knowledge of the item involved.\n\n(b) Three Written Quotes. Written request for written quotes from a minimum of three qualified sources of supply may be made and, unless adequate public notice is provided in the South Carolina Business Opportunities, documentation of at least three bona fide, responsive, and responsible quotes must be attached to the purchase requisition for a small purchase not in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars, or for a small purchase of commercially available off-the-shelf products not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, or for a small purchase of construction not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars.

Requests must be distributed equitably among qualified supplies unless advertised as provided above.\n\n(c) Advertised Small Purchase. Written solicitation of written quotes, bids, or proposals may be made for a small purchase, other than a small purchase of construction, not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars. The procurement must be advertised at least once in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication. A copy of the written solicitation and written quotes must be attached to the purchase requisition. The award must be made to the lowest responsive and responsible source or, when a request for proposal process is used, the highest ranking offeror.\n\n(3) Advertising Threshold. Except for procurements of either commercially available off-the-shelf products or construction, if conducted pursuant to item (2)(b), all competitive procurements above twenty-five thousand dollars must be advertised at least once in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication. Governmental bodies may charge vendors the cost incurred for copying and mailing bid or proposal documents requested in response to a procurement.\n\n(4) The Division of Aeronautics of the Department of Commerce may act as its own purchasing agency for all procurements of maintenance services for aircraft and these procurements may be conducted pursuant to subsection (2)(b).\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 23; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 11A; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 29; 2011 Act No. 74, Pt V, Section 6, eff August 1, 2011; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 25, eff May 13, 2019.",

      "text": "Exceptions in Competitive Sealed Bidding Procedures. The process of competitive sealed bidding as required by Section 11-35-3015(2)(b) must be performed in accordance with the procedures outlined in Article 5 of this code subject to the following exceptions:\n\n(a) Invitation for Bids. Each governmental body is responsible for developing a formal invitation for bids for each state construction project. The invitation must include, but not be limited to, all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. A copy of each invitation for bids must be filed with the State Engineer's Office and must be advertised formally in an official state government publication. Adequate notice of the invitation for bids must be given at a reasonable time before the date set forth in it for the opening of bids. The manner in which this official state government publication must be published, the content of the publication itself, the frequency of the publication, the method of subscription to the publication, and the manner by which the publication is distributed must be established by regulation of the board.\n\n(b) Bid Acceptance. Instead of Section 11-35-1520(6), the following provision applies. Bids must be accepted unconditionally without alteration or correction, except as otherwise authorized in this code. The governmental body's invitation for bids must set forth all requirements of the bid including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) The governmental body, in consultation with the architect-engineer assigned to the project, shall identify by license classification or subclassification in the invitation for bids all subcontractors who are expected to perform work for the prime contractor to or about the construction when those subcontractors' contracts are each expected to exceed three percent of the prime contractor's total base bid. In addition, the governmental body, in consultation with the architect-engineer assigned to the project, may identify by license classification or subclassification in the invitation for bids a subcontractor who is expected to perform work which is vital to the project. The determination of which subcontractors are included in the list provided in the invitation for bids is not protestable pursuant to Section 11-35-4210 or another provision of this code. A bidder in response to an invitation for bids shall clearly identify in his bid only those subcontractors to perform the work as identified in the invitation for bids. If the bidder determines to use his own employees to perform a portion of the work for which he would otherwise be required to list a subcontractor and if the bidder is qualified to perform that work under the terms of the invitation for bids, the bidder shall list himself in the appropriate place in his bid and not subcontract that work except with the approval of the governmental body for good cause shown.\n\n(ii) Failure to complete the list provided in the invitation for bids renders the bidder's bid unresponsive.\n\n(iii) The governmental body shall send all responsive bidders a copy of the bid tabulation within ten working days following the bid opening.\n\n(c) Instead of Section 11-35-1520(10), the following provisions apply:\n\n(i) Unless there is a compelling reason to reject bids as prescribed by regulation of the board, notice of an intended award of a contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids must be given by posting the notice at a location that is specified in the invitation for bids. The invitation for bids and the posted notice must contain a statement of the bidder's right to protest pursuant to Section 11-35-4210(1) and the date and location of posting must be announced at bid opening. In addition to posting notice, the governmental body promptly shall send all responsive bidders a copy of the notice of intended award and of the bid tabulation. The mailed notice must indicate the posting date and must contain a statement of the bidder's right to protest pursuant to Section 11-35-4210(1).\n\n(ii) After five business days' notice is given, the governmental body may enter into a contract with the bidder named in the notice in accordance with the provisions of this code and of the bid solicited. The procurement officer must comply with Section 11-35-1810.\n\n(iii) If, at bid opening, only one bid is received and determined to be responsive and responsible and within the governmental body's construction budget, award may be made without the five-day waiting period.\n\n(d) Negotiations after Unsuccessful Competitive Sealed Bidding. Instead of Section 11-35-1540, the following provisions apply:\n\n(i) If bids received pursuant to an invitation for bids exceed available funds, and it is determined in writing by the governmental body that circumstances do not permit the delay required to resolicit competitive sealed bids, and the base bid, less deductive alternates, does not exceed available funds by an amount greater than ten percent of the construction budget established for that portion of the work, a contract may be negotiated pursuant to this section with the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. The governmental body may change the scope of the work to reduce the price to be within the established construction budget but may not reduce the price below the established construction budget more than ten percent without a written request by the agency and the written approval of the chief procurement officer based on the interest of the State.\n\n(ii) If the lowest base bid received pursuant to an invitation for bids exceeds approved available funds and the governmental body is able to identify additional funds for the project, as certified by the appropriate fiscal officers, in the amount of the difference between the lowest base bid and the approved available funds for the project, the governmental body shall submit a request to use those additional funds in accordance with Chapter 47, Title 2.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1981 Act No. 179 Section 16; 1992 Act No. 442, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 27; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 65; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 40; 2008 Act No. 174, Section 13; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 40, eff May 13, 2019.",

      "text": "(1) Bid Security.\n\n(a) Requirement for Bid Security. Bid security is required for all competitive sealed bidding for construction contracts in a design-bid-build procurement in excess of one hundred thousand dollars and other contracts as may be prescribed by the State Engineer's Office. Bid security is a bond provided by a surety company meeting the criteria established by the regulations of the board or otherwise supplied in a form that may be established by regulation of the board.\n\n(b) Amount of Bid Security. Bid security must be in an amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid at a minimum.\n\n(c) Rejection of Bids for Noncompliance with Bid Security Requirements. When the invitation for bids requires security, noncompliance requires that the bid be rejected except that a bidder who fails to provide bid security in the proper amount or a bid bond with the proper rating must be given one working day from bid opening to cure the deficiencies. If the bidder is unable to cure these deficiencies within one working day of bid opening, his bid must be rejected.\n\n(d) Withdrawal of Bids. After the bids are opened, they must be irrevocable for the period specified in the invitation for bids. If a bidder is permitted to withdraw its bid in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board, action must not be had against the bidder or the bid security.\n\n(2) Contract Performance Payment Bonds.\n\n(a) When Required-Amounts. Contracts for construction must require the following bonds or security:\n\n(i) a performance bond satisfactory to the State, executed by a surety company meeting the criteria established by the board in regulations, or otherwise secured in a manner satisfactory to the State, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the portion of the contract price that does not include the cost of operation, maintenance, and finance;\n\n(ii) a payment bond satisfactory to the State, executed by a surety company meeting the criteria established by the board in regulations, or otherwise secured in a manner satisfactory to the State, for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material to the contractor or its subcontractors for the performance of the construction work provided for in the contract. The bond must be in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the portion of the contract price that does not include the cost of operation, maintenance, and finance;\n\n(iii) in the case of a construction contract valued at fifty thousand dollars or less, the governmental body may waive the requirements of subitems (i) and (ii) above, if the governmental body has protected the State;\n\n(iv) in the case of a construction manager at-risk contract, the solicitation may provide that bonds or security are not required during the project's preconstruction or design phase, if construction does not commence until the requirements of subitems (i) and (ii) above have been satisfied. Additionally, the solicitation may provide that bonds or security as described in subitems (i) and (ii) above may be furnished for one or more designated portions of the project, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the value of the construction of each designated portion, and also may prescribe the time of delivery of the bonds or security. In no event may construction of any portion of the work commence until the appropriate bonds or security have been delivered to the governmental body;\n\n(v) in the case of a design-build, design-build-operate-maintain, or design-build-finance-operate-maintain contract, the solicitation may provide that bonds or security as described in subitems (i) and (ii) above may be furnished for one or more designated portions of the project, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the value of the design and construction of each designated portion, and also may prescribe the time of delivery of the bonds or security. In no event may design or construction of any portion of the work commence until the appropriate bonds or security have been delivered to the governmental body.\n\n(b) Authority to Require Additional Bonds. Item (2) does not limit the authority of the board to require a performance bond or other security in addition to these bonds, or in circumstances other than specified in subitem (a) of that item in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board.\n\n(c) Suits on Payment Bonds-Right to Institute. A person who has furnished labor, material, or rental equipment to a bonded contractor or his subcontractors for the work specified in the contract, and who has not been paid in full for it before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by the person or material or rental equipment was furnished or supplied by the person for which the claim is made, has the right to sue on the payment bond for the amount, or the balance of it, unpaid at the time of institution of the suit and to prosecute the action for the sum or sums justly due the person. A remote claimant has a right of action on the payment bond only upon giving written notice to the contractor within ninety days from the date on which the person did or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material or rental equipment upon which the claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed as unpaid and the name of the party to whom the material or rental equipment was furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed. The written notice to the bonded contractor must be served personally or served by mailing the notice by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the bonded contractor at any place the bonded contractor maintains a permanent office for the conduct of its business, or at the current address as shown on the records of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. The aggregate amount of a claim against the payment bond by a remote claimant may not exceed the amount due by the bonded contractor to the person to whom the remote claimant has supplied labor, materials, rental equipment, or services, unless the remote claimant has provided notice of furnishing labor, materials, or rental equipment to the bonded contractor. The written notice to the bonded contractor must generally conform to the requirements of Section 29-5-20(B) and sent by certified or registered mail to the bonded contractor at any place the bonded contractor maintains a permanent office for the conduct of its business, or at the current address as shown on the records of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. After receiving the notice of furnishing labor, materials, or rental equipment, payment by the bonded contractor may not lessen the amount recoverable by the remote claimant. The aggregate amount of claims on the payment bond may not exceed the penal sum of the bond. A suit under this section must not be commenced after the expiration of one year after the last date of furnishing or providing labor, services, materials, or rental equipment.\n\nFor purposes of this section, \"bonded contractor\" means the contractor or subcontractor furnishing the payment bond, and \"remote claimant\" means a person having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor or supplier of a bonded contractor, but no expressed or implied contractual relationship with the bonded contractor. Any payment bond surety for the bonded contractor must have the same rights and defenses of the bonded contractor as provided in this section.\n\n(d) Suits on Payment Bonds-Where and When Brought. Every suit instituted upon a payment bond must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for the county or circuit in which the construction contract was to be performed; except that a suit must not be commenced after the expiration of one year after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied by the person bringing suit. The obligee named in the bond need not be joined as a party in the suit.\n\n(3) Bonds Forms and Copies.\n\n(a) Bonds Forms. The board shall promulgate by regulation the form of the bonds required by this section.\n\n(b) Certified Copies of Bonds. A person may request and obtain from the governmental body a certified copy of a bond upon payment of the cost of reproduction of the bond and postage, if any. A certified copy of a bond is prima facie evidence of the contents, execution, and delivery of the original.\n\n(4) Retention.\n\n(a) Maximum amount to be withheld. In a contract or subcontract for construction which provides for progress payments in installments based upon an estimated percentage of completion, with a percentage of the contract's proceeds to be retained by the State or general contractor pending completion of the contract or subcontract, the retained amount of each progress payment or installment must be no more than three and one-half percent.\n\n(b) Release of Retained Funds. When the work to be performed on a state construction project or pursuant to a state construction contract is to be performed by multiple prime contractors or by a prime contractor and multiple subcontractors, the work contracted to be done by each individual contractor or subcontractor is considered a separate division of the contract for the purpose of retention. As each division of the contract is certified as having been completed, that portion of the retained funds which is allocable to the completed division of the contract must be released forthwith to the prime contractor, who, within ten days of its receipt, shall release to the subcontractor responsible for the completed work the full amount of retention previously withheld from him by the prime contractor.\n\n(5) Bonds for Bid Security and Contract Performance. The requirement of a bond for bid security on a construction contract, pursuant to subsection (1), and a construction contract performance bond, pursuant to subsection (2), may not include a requirement that the surety bond be furnished by a particular surety company or through a particular agent or broker.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 178, Sections 29-31; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 10A; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2000 Act No. 240, Section 2; 2002 Act No. 253, Section 3; 2005 Act No. 97, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 41; 2008 Act No. 174, Section 14; 2014 Act No. 264 (S.1026), Section 3, eff June 6, 2014; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 43, eff May 13, 2019.",

A governmental body shall establish its own architect-engineer, construction management, and land surveying services selection committee, referred to as the agency selection committee, which must be composed of those individuals the agency head determines to be qualified to make an informed decision as to the most competent and qualified firm for the proposed project. The head of the governmental body or his qualified responsible designee shall sit as a permanent member of the agency selection committee for the purpose of coordinating and accounting for the committee's work. To assist an agency selection committee in the selection of firms to be employed for significant or highly technical projects and to facilitate prompt selections, the agency selection committee may invite the State Engineer or his designee to sit as a nonvoting member of the committee.\n\n(2)(a) Advertisement of Project Description. The agency selection committee is responsible for:\n\n(i) developing a description of the proposed project;\n\n(ii) enumerating all required professional services for that project; and\n\n(iii) preparing a formal invitation to firms for submission of information.\n\n(b) The invitation must include, but not be limited to, the project title, the general scope of work, a description of all professional services required for that project, the submission deadline, and how interested firms may apply for consideration. The agency selection committee shall file a copy of the project description and the invitation with the State Engineer's Office. Adequate notice of the invitation must be given at a reasonable time before the date set forth in it for receipt of responses. The invitation must be advertised formally in an official state government publication. The manner in which this official state government publication must be published, the content of the publication itself, the frequency of the publication, the method for subscription to the publication, and the manner by which the publication is distributed must be established by regulation of the board.\n\n(3) Response to Invitation. The date for submission of information from interested persons or firms in response to an invitation must not be less than fifteen days after publication of the invitation. Interested architect-engineer, construction management, and land surveying persons or firms shall respond to the invitation with the submission of a current and accurate Federal Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, or successor form or similar information as the State Engineer may specify in the Manual for Planning and Execution of State Permanent Improvement Projects, Part II, and other information that the particular invitation may require.\n\n(4) Interviews with Interested Firms. Following receipt of information from all interested persons and firms, the agency selection committee shall hold interviews with at least three persons or firms who respond to the committee's advertisement and who are considered most qualified on the basis of information available before the interviews. A list of firms selected for interview must be sent to all firms that submitted information in response to the advertisement, before the date selected for the interviews. If less than three persons or firms respond to the advertisement, the committee shall hold interviews with those that did respond. The agency selection committee's determination as to which are to be interviewed must be in writing and based upon its review and evaluation of all submitted materials. The written report of the committee must list specifically the names of all persons and firms that responded to the advertisement and enumerate the reasons of the committee for selecting those to be interviewed. The purpose of the interviews is to provide the further information that may be required by the agency selection committee to fully acquaint itself with the relative qualifications of the several interested firms.\n\n(5) Selection and Ranking of the Three Most Qualified.\n\n(a) The agency selection committee shall evaluate each of the persons or firms interviewed in view of their:\n\n(i) past performance;\n\n(ii) the ability of professional personnel;\n\n(iii) demonstrated ability to meet time and budget requirements;\n\n(iv) location and knowledge of the locality of the project if the application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project;\n\n(v) recent, current, and projected workloads of the firms;\n\n(vi) creativity and insight related to the project;\n\n(vii) related experience on similar projects;\n\n(viii) volume of work awarded by the using agency to the person or firm during the previous five years, with the objective of effectuating an equitable distribution of contracts by the State among qualified firms including Minority Business Enterprises certified by the South Carolina Office of Small and Minority Business Assistance and firms that have not had previous state work; and\n\n(ix) any other special qualification required pursuant to the solicitation of the using agency.\n\n(b) Based upon these evaluations, the agency selection committee shall select the three persons or firms that, in its judgment, are the best qualified, ranking the three in priority order. The agency selection committee's report ranking the three chosen persons or firms must be in writing and include data substantiating its determinations.\n\n(6) Notice of Selection and Ranking. When it is determined by the agency that the ranking report is final, written notification of the highest ranked person or firm must be sent immediately to all firms interviewed.\n\n(7) Negotiation of Contract. The governing body of the governmental body or its designee shall negotiate a contract for services with the most qualified person or firm at a compensation that is fair and reasonable to the State. If the governing body of the governmental body or its designee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with this person or firm, negotiations must be terminated formally. Negotiations must commence in the same manner with the second and then the third most qualified until a satisfactory contract is negotiated. If an agreement is not reached with one of the three, additional persons or firms in order of their competence and qualifications must be selected after consultation with the agency selection committee, and negotiations must be continued in the same manner until agreement is reached.\n\n(8) State Engineer's Office Review. The head of the governmental body shall submit the following documents to the State Engineer's Office for its review:\n\n(a) the written report of the agency selection committee, listing the persons or firms that responded to the invitation to submit information and enumerating the reasons of the committee for selecting the particular ones to be interviewed;\n\n(b) the written ranking report of the agency selection committee and all data substantiating the determinations made in that report; and\n\n(c) the tentative contract between the governmental body and the selected person or firm.\n\n(9) Approval or Disagreement by State Engineer's Office. The State Engineer's Office has ten days to review the data submitted by the agency selection committee, and to determine its position with respect to the particular person or firm recommended for approval by the agency. If the State Engineer's Office disagrees with the proposal, it may contest the proposal by submitting the matter to the board for decision. In the event of approval, the State Engineer's Office shall notify immediately in writing the governmental body and the person or firm selected of the award and authorize the governmental body to execute a contract with the selected person or firm. In the event of disagreement, the State Engineer's Office immediately shall notify the governmental body in writing of its intention to contest the ranking and the reasons for it. All contract negotiations by the governing body must be suspended pending a decision by the board concerning a contested ranking. The board shall hear contests at its next regularly scheduled meeting after notification of the governmental body. If the board rules in support of the State Engineer's Office position, the governmental body shall submit the name of another person or firm to the State Engineer's Office for consideration, selected in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this section. If the board rules in support of the governmental body, the governmental body must be notified in writing and authorized to execute a contract with the selected person or firm.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 148, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 33; 1997 Act No. 153, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 376, Section 44; 2008 Act No. 174, Section 16; 2019 Act No. 41 (S.530), Section 46, eff May 13, 2019.",

All task orders must be issued on a fixed-price basis.\n\n(2) A quote request for construction must be provided to all task order contractors. A task order for construction may not be issued unless the governmental body receives at least two responsive, bona fide, fixed-price quotes. Any award must be issued to the contractor submitting the lowest responsive quote.\n\n(3) All task orders must be issued within the period of the contract and must be within the scope and maximum value of the contract.\n\n(4) A task order for construction may not be less than ninety thousand dollars and may not exceed three hundred fifty thousand dollars. Work may not be aggregated or divided artificially in order to avoid these limits.\n\n(E) Any solicitation for a task order contract must include the following:\n\n(1) the period of the contract, including the number of options to extend the contract and the period for which the contract may be extended under each option, if any;\n\n(2) the maximum dollar value of the services to be procured under the contract;\n\n(3) the minimum and maximum dollar value of the services to be procured under a single task order;\n\n(4) a description that reasonably describes the licensing classification and the general scope, nature, complexity, and purposes of the services to be procured under the contract in a manner that will enable a prospective offeror to decide whether to submit an offer;\n\n(5) the procedures that the governmental body will use for requesting fixed price quotes and for issuing orders, a restriction on communications between contractors regarding pending quote requests, and a requirement that all contractors must respond to all quote requests;\n\n(6) the geographic area to which the task order contract applies.

The South Carolina General Assembly declares that business firms owned and operated by minority persons have been historically restricted from full participation in our free enterprise system to a degree disproportionate to other businesses. The General Assembly believes that it is in the state's best interest to assist minority-owned businesses to develop fully as a part of the state's policies and programs which are designed to promote balanced economic and community growth throughout the State. The General Assembly, therefore, wishes to ensure that those businesses owned and operated by minorities are afforded the opportunity to fully participate in the overall procurement process of the State. The General Assembly, therefore, takes this leadership role in setting procedures that will result in awarding contracts and subcontracts to minority business firms in order to enhance minority capital ownership, overall state economic development and reduce dependency on the part of minorities.\n\n(2) Implementation.
