      "text": "The General Assembly makes the following findings:\n\n1. From time to time various political subdivisions and public bodies including but not limited to counties, cities, towns, public service districts and authorities, issue general obligation bonds under various authorizing statutes to finance the construction of projects such as hospitals, water systems, sewer systems, airports and other public projects which produce revenues.\n\n2. Many of the statutes which authorize the issuance of such general obligation bonds contain no provision that the bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of the revenues to be derived from the operation of the projects financed by such bonds and no provision that the annual tax levy to be made for the payment of debt service on such bonds may be reduced in each year by the amount of such revenues actually on hand and available for payment of debt service at the time the annual levy is to be made.\n\n3. That the authorization to make such a pledge to additionally secure such bonds would enable the issuer thereof to strengthen the security of its general obligation bonds, and to shift at least a portion of the burden of the debt-service payments from ad valorem taxes on the property owners within its taxing jurisdiction to those who pay rates and charges for the facilities and services furnished by the projects financed by such general obligation bonds.\n\nHISTORY: 1975 (59) 174.",
