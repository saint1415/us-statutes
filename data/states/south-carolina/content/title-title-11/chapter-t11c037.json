(2) create and maintain a special fund for the payment of the principal of and interest on any local obligations and any other amounts becoming due under any agreement entered into in connection with the local obligation, or for the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of the project or any portions of it or other property of the local government, and deposit into any fund amounts sufficient to make any payments as they become due and payable; (3) create and maintain other special funds as required by the authority; and (4) perform other acts, including the conveyance of real and personal property together with all right, title, and interest in the property to the authority, or take other actions considered necessary or desirable by the authority to secure payment of the principal of and interest on the local obligations and to provide for the remedies for the authority or other holder of the local obligations in the event of any default by the local government in the payment, including, without limitation, any of the following: (a) the procurement of insurance, guarantees, letters of credit, and other forms of collateral, security, liquidity arrangements or credit supports for local obligations from any source, public or private, and the payment of premiums, fees, or other charges; (b) the payment of the allocable shares of local governments, as determined by the authority, of any costs, fees, charges, or expenses attributable to insurance, guarantees, letters of credit, and other forms of collateral, security, liquidity arrangements, or credit supports incurred in connection with the issuance of bonds by the authority to acquire local obligations of one or more local governments.

It is desirable that the authority issue its bonds within the next ninety days so that the proceeds may be used to enable local governmental units to pay off outstanding loans to the Farmers Home Administration at a substantial discount which will not be available after May 9, 1989. (B) Act 682 of 1988 contains features authorizing the issuing of bonds for the benefit of private eleemosynary companies; permitting bond proceeds to be used to acquire local obligations payable from property taxes; permitting the imposition of local property taxes by the Comptroller General for the repayment of local obligations and providing for the payment of local obligations and authority bonds from state appropriations. It is anticipated that these features will be presented to the court for a confirmation of their constitutionality. In the meantime, the authority shall proceed in order to meet the deadline established by the Farmers Home Administration to issue, pursuant to Act 682 of 1988, bonds which can be issued independent of the features described above. The General Assembly declares that the remaining portion of Act 682 of 1988 is capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent, wholly independent of those features described above, or any of them.
