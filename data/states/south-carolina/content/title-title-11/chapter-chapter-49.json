These terms must include the issuance date or dates, the maturity date or dates, the principal amount, the interest rates or the means of determining the same, whether fixed or variable, the time, manner, and currency for paying interest and principal, the negotiability of the bonds and any restrictions relating to the registration of the bonds; and the covenants may include, without limitation, the establishment and maintenance of dedicated reserve funds for the payment of debt service on bonds if the State's tobacco receipts are inadequate in any year, restrictions on the later issuance of additional bonds or making the later issuance subject to certain conditions relating to available debt service coverage or otherwise, conditions on the timing of the release of all or a portion of the State's tobacco receipts to the general fund of this State, the enforcement of the master settlement agreement, or any other matter that the board considers appropriate, subject to subsection (I) of this section.\n\n(I) The board may not authorize or cause the authority to enter into any covenant that purports to create a general, legal or moral obligation of this State or any of its political subdivisions or to pledge the full faith, credit, or taxing power of the State or any of its political subdivisions; nor may the board authorize or cause the authority to enter into any covenants that purport to create a right on the part of the board, the authority, any bondholder, or any trustee any right to recover funds consisting of the State's tobacco receipts once those funds have been deposited into the general fund of the State in accordance with the terms of this chapter.
