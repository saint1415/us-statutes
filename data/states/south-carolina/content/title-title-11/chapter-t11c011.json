      "text": "(A)(1) Beginning with fiscal year 2007-2008, school districts of this State must be reimbursed from the Homestead Exemption Fund in the manner provided in this subsection. The reimbursement due a school district for fiscal year 2007-2008 and thereafter consists of three tiers. The tier one reimbursement is an amount equal to the amount received by the district pursuant to the provisions of Section 12-37-251 as those provisions applied for fiscal year 2006-2007. The tier one reimbursement is fixed at the fiscal year 2006-2007 amount and continues into succeeding fiscal years at this fixed amount. The tier two reimbursement is the amount to be received by the district pursuant to the provisions of Section 12-37-270 for fiscal year 2006-2007 for the school operating millage portion of the reimbursement for the homestead exemption allowed pursuant to Section 12-37-250. The tier two reimbursement is fixed at this fiscal year 2006-2007 amount and continues into succeeding fiscal years at this fixed amount. The tier three reimbursement is derived from the revenue of the tax imposed pursuant to Article 11, Chapter 36, Title 12, and for fiscal year 2007-2008, consists of an amount equal dollar for dollar to the revenue that would be collected by the district from property tax for school operating purposes imposed by the district on owner-occupied residential property for that fiscal year as if no reimbursed exemptions applied, plus an amount that a district may have received in its fiscal year 2006-2007 reimbursements pursuant to Section 12-37-251 in excess of the computed amount of that exemption from school operating millage for that year, reduced by the total of the district's tier one and tier two reimbursements. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2008-2009 a school district shall receive in reimbursements the total of what it received in fiscal year 2007-2008 plus the tier three reimbursement increases provided for in item (3). The tier three reimbursement increases of the several school districts as provided in item (3) for any year must be aggregated and the reimbursement increase a particular school district shall receive for that year must be equal to an amount that is the school district's proportionate share of such funds based on the district's weighted pupil units as a percentage of statewide weighted pupil units as determined annually pursuant to the Education Finance Act. For purposes of the reimbursement increases school districts receive under this subsection based on weighted pupil units determined pursuant to the Education Finance Act, an additional add-on weighting for students in poverty of 0.20 must be included in the weightings provided in Section 59-20-40(1)(c) of the 1976 Code. The weighting for poverty shall provide additional revenues for students in kindergarten through grade twelve who qualify for Medicaid or who qualify for reduced or free lunches, or both. Revenues generated by this weighting must be used by districts and schools to provide services and research-based strategies for addressing academic or health needs of these students to ensure their future academic success, to provide summer school, reduced class size, after school programs, extended day, instructional materials, or any other research-based educational strategy to improve student academic performance. (3)(a) Beginning with the fiscal year 2008-2009 reimbursements, these tier three reimbursements must be increased on an annual basis by an inflation factor equal to the percentage increase in the previous year of the Consumer Price Index, Southeast Region, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics plus the percentage increase in the previous year in the population of the State as determined by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. Distribution of these reimbursement increases must be as provided in this subsection. (b) If the total increase provided pursuant to subitem (a) of this item is less than four percent, then to the extent revenues are available in the Homestead Exemption Fund, the CPI/population increase provided pursuant to subitem (a) of this item is further increased, not to exceed a total of four percent. (4) The percentage of population growth in any year for any school district entitled to reimbursements from the Homestead Exemption Fund must be based on estimates for such growth in the county wherein the school district is located as determined by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. Where the school district encompasses areas in more than one county, the population growth in that entity must be the average of the growth in each county weighted to reflect the existing population of the school district in that county as compared to the existing population of the school district as a whole. (5)(a) No later than December thirty-first of each year, the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office shall provide each school district with a preliminary estimate of the district's reimbursements from the Homestead Exemption Fund for the fiscal year beginning the following July first. A final estimate must be provided to each district by February fifteenth. The February fifteenth forecast may be adjusted if the Office of Research and Statistics determines that changing conditions have affected the forecast. (b) The Department of Revenue shall pay the reimbursements provided pursuant to this subsection to the county treasurer for the credit of each school district in the county. The reimbursement must be paid on the application of the county treasurer according to the following schedule: (i) ninety percent of the tier one reimbursement must be paid in the last quarter of the calendar year no later than December first. The balance of the tier one reimbursement must be paid in the last quarter of the fiscal year that ends June thirtieth following the first tier one reimbursement date; (ii) tier two reimbursements must be paid on the same schedule as the second tier one reimbursement; (iii) tier three reimbursements must be paid in nine equal monthly installments based on one-tenth of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office estimate, beginning not later than October fifteenth. A final adjustment balance payment must be made before the closing of the state's books for the fiscal year. (6) To the extent revenues in the Homestead Exemption Fund are insufficient to pay all reimbursements to a school district required by this subsection (A) and subsection (B), the difference must be paid from the state general fund. However, no general fund revenues may be used to achieve the distribution provided pursuant to item (3)(b) of this subsection. (7) Operating millage levied in a county for alternative schools, career and technology centers, and county boards of education whether or not levied countywide or on a school district by school district basis in a county also is considered school operating millage to which the reimbursements provided for in this section apply. (8) Reimbursements to a school district under this subsection must be considered in the computation of the required Education Improvement Act maintenance of local effort. (B)(1) After the required reimbursements to school districts in a county have been made from the Homestead Exemption Fund for any year pursuant to subsection (A), a county, if the districts in that county have not together received a total of at least two million five hundred thousand dollars in tier three reimbursements, must receive an additional disbursement from the Homestead Exemption Fund to bring the total reimbursements to the districts in that county to at least two million five hundred thousand dollars. This additional disbursement must be paid to the county for disbursement to the school districts located within that county. These distributions under this subsection to any district in the county must be equal to the one hundred thirty-five day average daily membership of the district divided by the total average daily membership of all students in the districts in the county times the required amount of funds to bring the total reimbursements to the school districts in that county to at least two million five hundred thousand dollars. (2) If a school district encompasses more than one county, the one hundred thirty-five day average daily membership of the students from that county attending schools of the district must be used to compute the distributions required by this subsection. (3) The distributions to a county and then to a school district under this subsection must be considered to be outside of the Education Finance Act and must not be considered when computing the maintenance of local effort required of that district under the Education Improvement Act. (C) When determined, any balance in the Homestead Exemption Fund remaining at the end of a fiscal year after the payments to school districts and counties pursuant to subsections (A) and (B) of this section must be segregated within the Homestead Exemption Fund and remitted in the next fiscal year to counties in the proportion that the population of the county is to the total population of the State. Population data must be as determined in the decennial United States Census and the most recent update to that data as determined by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. Revenues received by the county must be used to provide a property tax credit against the property tax liability for county operations on owner-occupied residential property classified for property tax purposes pursuant to Section 12-43-220(c). The credit is an amount determined by dividing the total estimated revenues credited to the county during the applicable fiscal year by the number of parcels in the county eligible for the credit. Credit that exceeds the tax due on a parcel must be reallocated in a uniform amount to remaining parcels with a property tax liability for county operations. The distributions under this subsection are not an obligation of the state general fund if sufficient funds are not available to make such distributions from the Homestead Exemption Fund. (D) Notwithstanding another provision of this section, in the case of a redevelopment project area created pursuant to Chapter 6, 7, or 12 of Title 31, the reimbursements provided pursuant to this section for the property tax exemption allowed by Section 12-37-220(B)(47) must include full payment to the city or county creating the redevelopment project area for amounts that would have been payable to the special tax allocation fund created pursuant to that chapter if no such exemption existed.

State appropriations subject to the spending limitation are those appropriations authorized annually in the State General Appropriation Act and acts supplemental thereto which fund general, school, and highway purposes. A statement of total \"General, School, and Highway Revenues\" must be included in each annual General Appropriation Act. As used in this section the appropriations so limited as defined above must be those funded by \"General, School, and Highway Revenues\" that must be defined as such in the 1985-86 General Appropriation Act; it being the intent of this section that all additional nonfederal and nonuser fee revenue items must be included in that category as they may be created by act of the General Assembly. (B) The limitation on state appropriations prescribed in subsection (A) is an amount equal to either those state appropriations authorized by the spending limit for the previous fiscal year increased by the average percentage rate of growth in state personal income for the previous three completed calendar years or nine and one-half percent of the total personal income of the State for the calendar year ending before the fiscal year under consideration, whichever is greater. As used in this section, \"state personal income\" means total personal income for a calendar year as determined by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office or its successor based on the most recent data of the United States Department of Commerce or its successors. During the initial year this spending limit is in effect, the actual state appropriations for general, school, and highway purposes for the fiscal year 1985-1986 must be used as the base figure for computation of the spending limitation if the average rate of growth method is used. (C) The Comptroller General, or any other authorized agency, commission, or officer, may not approve or issue warrants which would allow disbursements above the amount appropriated for general fund purposes unless and until the General Assembly authorizes expenditures in excess of the limitation through procedures provided for in this article. This subsection may not apply to funds transferred from the reserve fund to the general fund. (D) The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office shall annually compute and certify to the General Assembly a current figure to limit appropriations as provided in subsection (B) of this section prior to the Governor's submission of his recommended budget to the House Ways and Means Committee. (E) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section, the General Assembly may declare a financial emergency and suspend the spending limitation for any one fiscal year for a specific amount by a special vote as provided in this subsection by enactment of legislation which relates only to that matter. The authorized state appropriations for the fiscal year following the suspension must be determined as if the suspension had not occurred and, for purposes of determining subsequent limits, must be presumed to have been the maximum limit which could have been authorized if such limitation had not been suspended. The special vote referred to in this subsection means an affirmative vote in each branch of the General Assembly by two-thirds of the members present and voting but not less than three-fifths of the total membership in each branch. (F) In any year when surplus funds are collected, such revenue surplus may be appropriated by the General Assembly to match funds for public education, public welfare, public health, road and highway construction, rehabilitation, replacement, or maintenance financed in part with federal participation funding or federal grants or tolls, or to accelerate the retirement of bonded indebtedness or transferred to the general fund reserve, or tax relief or for avoiding the issuance of bonds for projects that are authorized but not issued or any combination of these purposes without regard to the spending limitation. For the purposes of this section, surplus funds mean that portion of revenues, as defined in subsection (A) of this section, over and above revenues authorized for appropriation in subsection (B).

      "text": "(A) In any fiscal year, the ratio of the number of permanent state positions to the total annually up-dated resident population of the State may not exceed that ratio of permanent state positions as existed in fiscal year 1980-81 compared to the total resident population of the State as determined by the 1980 decennial census. The number of permanent state positions shall be based on full-time annual equivalency funded in whole or in part by appropriations of the General Assembly as defined by the South Carolina Classification and Compensation System or its successor. (B) To insure compliance with subsection (A) of this section, the Executive Budget Office shall annually and prior to December first determine the total number of permanent state positions based on full-time annual equivalency and the total resident population of the State for which data are available. (C) The Governor may not present to the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives and the committee may not introduce any appropriation bill which provides for an increase in state employment in excess of the ratio prescribed in subsection (A) of this section. The committee may alter the specific positions created or eliminated so long as the total employment remains within the prescribed limitation. (D) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section, the General Assembly may declare an emergency and suspend the employment limitation for any one fiscal year for a specific number by a special vote as provided in this subsection by enactment of legislation which relates only to that matter. The authorized state employment for the fiscal year following the suspension must be determined as if the suspension had not occurred and, for purposes of determining subsequent limits, must be presumed to have been the maximum limit which could have been authorized if such limitation had not been suspended. The special vote referred to in this subsection means an affirmative vote in each branch of the General Assembly by two-thirds of the members present and voting, but not less than three-fifths of the total membership in each branch. (E) When an appropriation bill is under consideration by the House of Representatives or the Senate, the presiding officer of either House of the General Assembly shall not allow to be introduced an amendment to the bill which increases the number of state employees unless there is attached to the amendment a certificate of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office that the increase in state employees is within the limitations prescribed.

      "text": "(A) In order to continue to maintain the fiscal integrity of the State, the proceeds of the state bonds must not be used to fund operating expenses of state government and such proceeds must be used only for capital improvements. (B) In order to continue the policy of the State to maintain the full faith and credit of the State with respect to any existing or future bonded indebtedness, the principal and interest payments on general obligation bonds shall constitute priority state expenditures. (C) The issuance of general obligation bonds of the State must be limited so that the maximum annual debt service on all general obligation bonds of the State (excluding highway bonds, state institution bonds, tax anticipation notes, and bond anticipation notes) may not exceed five percent of the general revenues of the State for the fiscal year next preceding (excluding revenues which are authorized to be pledged for state highway bonds and state institution bonds).
