      "text": "Each state agency may establish a special account for the purpose of funding the agency's nonrecurring implementation expenses of the South Carolina Enterprise Information System (SCEIS). An agency may transfer into this account funds at the discretion of the agency head to be set aside and expended for the identified purpose. The total amount of funds transferred into the account cannot exceed the agency's implementation costs as projected by the SCEIS Project Team. The special account is exempt from the calculation of any mid-year budget reduction ordered by the Executive Budget Office or the General Assembly, as appropriate. Any unexpended balance in the special account may be carried forward to the succeeding fiscal year and expended for the same purposes. The Comptroller General shall monitor these special accounts to ensure compliance with the provisions of this joint resolution. It is the intent of the General Assembly that agencies pursue grants and other nonstate funding sources to fund their portion of the SCEIS implementation.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 151, Section 1.",

The South Carolina Enterprise Information System Oversight Committee, as appointed by the Comptroller General, shall provide oversight for the implementation and continued operations of the system. The Department of Administration is authorized to use any available existing technology resources to assist with funding of the initial implementation of the system. It is further the intent of the General Assembly to fund the central government costs related to the implementation of the system. Agencies are required to implement SCEIS at a cost and in accordance with a schedule developed and approved by the SCEIS Oversight Committee. Full implementation must be completed within five years. The Department of Administration must make an appropriation request for the implementation and operational costs for SCEIS, and the funding for those costs must be set out as a specific line item in the annual general appropriations act. Any issues arising with regard to project scope, implementation schedule, and associated costs shall be directed to the SCEIS Oversight Committee for resolution. In cooperation with the Comptroller General and the Department of Administration, the South Carolina Enterprise Information System Oversight Committee is required to report by January thirty-first of the fiscal year to the Governor, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee the status of the system's implementation and on-going operations.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 151, Section 2; 2013 Act No. 31, Section 12, eff May 21, 2013; 2014 Act No. 121 (S.22), Pt V, Section 7.X, eff July 1, 2015.",
