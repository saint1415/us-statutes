Special purpose districts, political subdivisions, and other units of local government are excluded from this definition.\n\n(2) \"Appeal\" means the request by a covered employee to the State Human Resources Director for review of an agency's final decision concerning a grievance.\n\n(3) \"Board\" means the Department of Administration.\n\n(4) \"Calendar days\" means the sequential days of a year. The time must be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, it must be excluded.\n\n(5) \"Class\" means a group of positions sufficiently similar in the duties performed, degree of supervision exercised or received, minimum requirements of education, experience or skill, and the other characteristics that the same state class title and the same state salary range are applied to each position in the group by the Office of Human Resources.\n\n(6) \"Committee\" means the State Employee Grievance Committee.\n\n(7) \"Covered employee\" means a full-time or part-time employee occupying a part or all of an established full-time equivalent (FTE) position who has completed the probationary period and has a \"meets\" or higher overall rating on the employee's performance evaluation and who has grievance rights. Instructional personnel are covered upon the completion of one academic year except for faculty at state technical colleges of not more than two full academic years' duration. If an employee does not receive an evaluation before the official review date, the employee must be considered to have performed in a satisfactory manner and be a covered employee. This definition does not include employees in positions such as temporary, temporary grant, or time-limited employees who do not have grievance rights.\n\n(8) \"Demotion\" means the assignment of an employee by the appointing authority from one established position to a different established position having a lower state salary range.\n\n(9) \"Deputy director\" means an employee who has been appointed under the provisions of Section 1-30-10(E), oversees a division, and reports directly to the agency head.\n\n(10) \"Full-time equivalent\" or \"FTE\" means a value expressing a percentage of time in hours and of funds related to a particular position authorized by appropriations acts enacted by the General Assembly.\n\n(11) \"Grievance\" means a complaint filed by a covered employee or the employee's representative regarding an adverse employment action designated in Section 8-17-330 taken by an agency.\n\n(12) \"Instructional personnel\" means employees of an agency that has primarily an educational mission, excluding the state technical colleges and excluding those employees exempted in Section 8-17-370(10) who work an academic year.\n\n(13) \"Involuntary reassignment\" means the movement of an employee's principal place of employment in excess of thirty miles from the prior work station at the initiative of the agency. The reassignment of an employee by an agency in excess of thirty miles from the prior work station to the nearest facility with an available position having the same state salary range for which the employee is qualified is not considered involuntary reassignment.\n\n(14) \"Mediation\" means an alternative dispute resolution process whereby a mediator who is an impartial third party acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of a dispute without prescribing what it should be. The process is informal and nonadversarial with the objective of helping the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\n(15) \"Mediation-arbitration\" means an alternative dispute resolution process that provides for the submission of an appeal to a mediator-arbitrator, an impartial third party who conducts conferences to attempt to resolve the grievance by mediation and render a decision that is final and binding on the parties if the appeal is not mediated.\n\n(16) \"Probationary employee\" means a full-time or part-time employee occupying a part or all of an established FTE position in the initial working test period of employment with the State of twelve months' duration for noninstructional personnel, of the academic year duration for instructional personnel except for those at state technical colleges, or of not more than two full academic years' duration for faculty at state technical colleges. An employee who receives an unsatisfactory performance appraisal during the probationary period must be terminated before becoming a covered employee.\n\n(17) \"Promotion\" means an employee's change from a position in one class to a position in another class having a higher state salary range. Failure to be selected for a promotion is not an adverse employment action that can be considered as a grievance or appeal.\n\n(18) \"Punitive reclassification\" means the assignment of a position in one class to a different lower class with the sole purpose to penalize the covered employee.\n\n(19) \"Reassignment\" means the movement within an agency of an employee from one position to another position having the same state salary range, or the movement of a position within an agency which does not require reclassification.\n\n(20) \"Reclassification\" means the assignment of a position in one class to another class which is the result of a natural or an organizational change in duties or responsibilities of the position.\n\n(21) \"Reduction in force\" means a determination made by an agency head to eliminate one or more filled positions in one or more organizational units within the agency due to budgetary limitations, shortage of work, or organizational changes.\n\n(22) \"Salary decrease based on performance\" means the reduction of a covered employee's compensation based on the results of an Employee Performance Management System (EPMS) evaluation.\n\n(23) \"State Human Resources Director\" means the head of the Office of Human Resources of the Department of Administration, or his designee.\n\n(24) \"Suspension\" means an enforced leave of absence without pay pending investigation of charges against an employee or for disciplinary purposes.\n\n(25) \"Temporary employee\" means a full-time or part-time employee who does not occupy an FTE position, whose employment is not to exceed one year, and who is not a covered employee.\n\n(26) \"Termination\" means the action taken by an agency against an employee to separate the employee involuntarily from employment.\n\n(27) \"Transfer\" means the movement to a different agency of an employee from one position to another position having the same state salary range, or the movement of a position from one agency to another agency which does not require reclassification.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 402, Section 2; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 9, eff July 1, 1993; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 8A, eff June 21, 1993, and subsec.

A copy of the approved agency grievance procedure must be made available to covered employees of the agency. The provisions of the State Administrative Procedures Act apply in proceedings before the State Employee Grievance Committee. At other levels the State Administrative Procedures Act does not apply, but the covered employee has the right to a representative, including counsel. When a final decision is rendered, it must be given to the covered employee or the employee's representative in writing. If the covered employee chooses to exercise the right to counsel, the employee does so at his own expense.\n\nThe procedure must provide that all grievances of agency actions affecting a covered employee must be initiated internally by such employee within fourteen calendar days of the effective date of the action and that the agency shall make a final decision on a grievance within forty-five calendar days of the filing of the grievance by the covered employee. Failure by the agency to make a final decision on the grievance within forty-five calendar days after the filing of the grievance is considered an adverse decision, and the covered employee may appeal thereafter to the State Human Resources Director. The internal time periods of the agency grievance procedure may be waived upon the mutual written agreement of both parties. The forty-five-calendar-day period for action by the agency may not be waived except by mutual written agreement of both parties. The time periods for appeal to the State Human Resources Director may not be waived.\n\nA covered employee who wishes to appeal the decision of the agency grievance procedure to the State Human Resources Director shall file an appeal within ten calendar days of receipt of the decision from the agency head or his designee or within fifty-five calendar days after the employee files the grievance with the agency, whichever occurs later. The covered employee or the employee's representative shall file the request in writing with the State Human Resources Director. Failure to file an appeal with the State Human Resources Director within ten calendar days of the agency's final decision or fifty-five calendar days from the initial grievance, whichever occurs later, constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal.\n\nAn employee must not be disciplined or otherwise prejudiced in employment for exercising rights or testifying under these processes.\n\nAs used in this article, a covered employee may file a grievance or appeal concerning the following adverse employment actions: terminations, suspensions, involuntary reassignments, and demotions. Reclassifications are considered a grievance only if an agency, or an appeal if the State Human Resources Director, determines that there is a material issue of fact that the action is a punitive reclassification. However, reclassifications, reassignments, and transfers within the same state salary range are not adverse employment actions which may be considered grievances or appeals. Promotions are not adverse employment actions which may be considered grievances or appeals except in instances where the agency, or in the case of appeals, the State Human Resources Director, determines that there is a material issue of fact as to whether or not an agency has considered a qualified covered employee for a position for which the employee formally applied or would have applied if the employee had known of the promotional opportunity. For purposes of this article, when an agency promotes an employee one organizational level above the promoted employee's former level, that action is not a grievance or appeal for any other qualified covered employee. Salary decreases based on performance are adverse employment actions that may be considered as grievances or appeals. A reduction in force is an adverse employment action considered as a grievance only if the agency, or as an appeal if the State Human Resources Director, determines that there is a material issue of fact that the agency inconsistently or improperly applied its reduction in force policy or plan.\n\nA covered employee has the right to appeal to the State Human Resources Director an adverse employment action involving the issues specified in this section after all administrative remedies to secure relief within the agency have been exhausted.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 402, Section 3; 1988 Act No. 375, eff March 14, 1988; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 8B, eff June 21, 1993; 1993 Act No. 178, Section 10, eff July 1, 1993; 1996 Act No. 284, Section 4, eff October 1, 1996.",

The State Human Resources Director shall forward to the committee for a hearing all appeals which meet jurisdictional requirements and relate to the following adverse employment actions: terminations, salary decreases based on performance, demotions, suspensions for more than ten days, and reductions in force when the State Human Resources Director determines there is a material issue of fact regarding inconsistent or improper application of the agency's reduction in force plan or policy. The committee shall consist of at least eighteen and not more than twenty-four members who must be appointed by the Director of Department of Administration to serve for terms of three years and until their successors are appointed and qualify. All members of the committee must be selected on a broadly representative basis from among the personnel of the various state agencies as recommended by the agency head.\n\nThe committee annually shall elect a chairman from among its members to serve for a one-year term. In addition, the State Human Resources Director may divide the committee into panels of five members to sit at hearings and designate a member to serve as the presiding officer and a member to serve as secretary at all panel hearings. A quorum of a panel consists of at least three members.\n\nVacancies occurring for a reason other than expiration of a term must be filled by the Director of Department of Administration in the same manner as the original appointments. Members may be reappointed for succeeding terms at the discretion of the Director of Department of Administration. The committee and the State Human Resources Director may recommend to the Director of Department of Administration that it promulgate regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of this article and the board is authorized to promulgate these and other necessary regulations.\n\nCommittee members shall receive their normal pay for the time they are required to be away from their regular assignments. They may be reimbursed as provided by law from funds appropriated to the Department of Administration for expenses, such as meals, lodging, and mileage, when using their personal automobiles, incurred in connection with the performance of necessary committee business.\n\n(B) Whenever an appeal before the committee is initiated by or involves an employee of an agency of which a committee member also is an employee or involves another impermissible conflict of interest, the member is disqualified from participating in the hearing.\n\n(C) The committee chairman or a designee shall conduct the grievance hearing in an equitable, orderly, and expeditious fashion. The committee chairman or a designee is authorized to administer oaths; to issue subpoenas for files, records, and papers; to call additional witnesses; and to subpoena witnesses. The Department of Administration is authorized to request assignment by the Attorney General of one or more of his staff attorneys admitted to practice law in South Carolina to serve in the capacity of committee attorney. If the Attorney General is not able to provide sufficient legal staff for this purpose due to an impermissible conflict of interest, the Department of Administration, with the approval of the Attorney General, is authorized to secure other qualified attorneys to serve as committee counsel. The committee attorney shall determine the order and relevance of the testimony and the appearance of witnesses, and shall rule on all motions, and all legal issues. The parties are bound by the decisions of the committee chairman or a designee or the committee attorney insofar as these hearings are concerned.\n\n(D) At these hearings the employee and the agency are allowed representatives, including counsel. During the course of the hearing the parties and witnesses also shall respond to questions asked by the committee attorney or the committee members. The committee attorney or the attorney for the Office of Human Resources may assist the committee in the preparation of its findings of fact, statements of policy, and conclusions of law. The committee attorney may be present during the committee's deliberations on its decision only upon the request of the presiding officer. Within twenty calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing, the committee shall render its decision on the appeal. The decision shall include the committee's findings of fact, statements of policy, and conclusions of law.\n\n(E) The committee may sustain, reject, or modify a grievance hearing decision of an agency as follows:\n\n(1) In cases involving actual or threatened abuse, neglect, or exploitation, to include those terms as they may be defined in Section 43-35-10 or 63-7-20, of a patient, client, or inmate by an employee, the agency's decision must be given greater deference and may not be altered or overruled by the committee, unless the covered employee establishes that:\n\n(a) The agency's finding that the covered employee abused, neglected, or exploited or threatened to abuse, neglect, or exploit a patient, client, or inmate is clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;\n\n(b) The agency's disciplinary action was not within its established personnel policies, procedures, and regulations; or\n\n(c) The agency's action was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n(2) In all other cases, the committee may not alter or overrule an agency's decision, unless the covered employee establishes that the agency's decision is one or more of the following and prejudices substantial rights of the covered employee:\n\n(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n\n(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n\n(c) made upon unlawful procedure;\n\n(d) affected by other error of law;\n\n(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\n\n(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(F) The decision of the committee members must be transmitted in writing to the employee and the employing agency and is final in terms of administrative review. As a result of this decision, either the covered employee or the agency may request a rehearing or reconsideration within thirty calendar days from receipt of the decision. A notice of appeal seeking appellate review of the final decision may be made by the covered employee to the Administrative Law Court as provided in Sections 1-23-380(B) and 1-23-600(D). Only after an agency submits a written request to the Office of Human Resources seeking approval of the Department of Administration may the agency file a notice of appeal seeking appellate review to the Administrative Law Court. However, the agency may perfect the appeal only upon approval of the Department of Administration. The covered employee or the agency who first files the notice of appeal seeking appellate review is responsible for preparation of a transcript and paying the costs of preparation of a transcript of the audio tapes of a hearing required for certification of the record to the Administrative Law Court. Neither the Department of Administration nor the Office of Human Resources nor the State Human Resources director nor the committee may be named in this notice of appeal. However, any of these entities are entitled to make a motion in the Administrative Law Court to be allowed to intervene to participate in the appeal for appropriate reasons including their interest in defending their policies.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 402, Section 4; 1993 Act No. 110, Section 2, eff three months after June 11, 1993; 1996 Act No. 284, Section 5, eff October 1, 1996; 2006 Act No. 387, Section 9, eff July 1, 2006.",

The mediator must be an impartial third party who shall act to encourage and facilitate the resolution of the dispute through mediation. The mediator shall review the documents which have been submitted by each party and shall schedule a time to meet with both parties, jointly or independently, to attempt to resolve the matter. Mediation conferences are confidential and limited to the parties and their representatives. Other persons may attend only with the permission of the parties and the mediator. The parties or their representatives attending a mediation conference must have full authority to negotiate and recommend settlement. Failure of the covered employee or the employee's representative to attend a mediation conference without reasonable justification constitutes a waiver of the employee's rights to further pursue the appeal. The State Human Resources Director shall determine whether or not reasonable justification exists based on documents submitted by the parties.\n\nThe mediator may not be compelled by subpoena or otherwise to divulge records or discussions or to testify in regard to the mediation in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum. All records, reports, documents, discussions, and other information received by the mediator while serving in that capacity are confidential.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 402, Section 6; 1996 Act No. 284, Section 7, eff October 1, 1996.",
