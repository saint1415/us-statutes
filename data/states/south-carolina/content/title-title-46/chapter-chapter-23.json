Provided, that no such noxious weed, product, article, or means of conveyance shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to the shipping point or so ordered to be destroyed, exported, or returned to the shipping point, unless in the opinion of the commission, there is no less drastic action which would be adequate to prevent the introduction or dissemination of noxious weeds.\n\n(b) The commission may order the owner or person in possession of any new or not theretofore widely prevalent noxious weed, or any product, article, or means of conveyance, or his agent to treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, export, return to shipping point, or make other disposition of such noxious weed, product, article, or means of conveyance without cost to the State or agency cooperating with the State in such a manner as the commission deems appropriate.
