This purpose is justified by the stated social desire of preserving and encouraging agricultural production.\n\n(5) With the exception of new swine operations and new slaughterhouse operations, in the interest of homeland security and in order to secure the availability, quality, and safety of food produced in South Carolina, it is the intent of the General Assembly that state law and the regulations of the Department of Health and Environmental Control pre-empt the entire field of and constitute a complete and integrated regulatory plan for agricultural facilities and agricultural operations as defined in Section 46-45-20, thereby precluding a county from passing an ordinance that is not identical to the state provisions.\n\nHISTORY: 1980 Act No. 452; 1990 Act No. 442, Section 1, eff April 24, 1990; 2006 Act No. 290, Section 1, eff upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on May 30, 2006).",
