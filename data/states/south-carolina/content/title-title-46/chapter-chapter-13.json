Sections 46-13-170 and 46-13-200 provide enforcement procedures. The registration must be renewed annually before September first.\n\n(1) Products which have the same formula and are manufactured by the same person, the labeling of which contains the same claims and the labels of which bear a designation identifying the product as the same pesticide, may be registered as a single pesticide. Additional names and labels must be added by supplemental statements during the current period of registration. The foregoing applies if the manufacturer is also the distributor. Products manufactured by one person for distribution by another and labeled as the distributor's products must be treated as separate products from those marketed as the manufacturer's products.\n\n(2) A change in the labeling or formulas of a pesticide may be made within the current period of registration without requiring a registration of the product. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, registration is not required for a pesticide shipped from one plant within this State to another plant within this State operated by the same person.\n\n(3) Registration is not required if the pesticide is distributed under the provisions of an experimental use permit issued under Section 46-13-30(E) or an experimental use permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n(B) The applicant for registration shall file a statement with the director which must include:\n\n(1) the name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the person whose name will appear on the label, if other than the applicant's;\n\n(2) the name of the pesticide;\n\n(3) a complete copy or facsimile of the labeling accompanying the pesticide and a statement of all claims to be made for it, including the directions for use;\n\n(4) the use classification as provided in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act when required by regulations under that act.\n\n(C) The director, when he considers it necessary, may require the submission of the complete formula of a pesticide including the active and inert ingredients.\n\n(D) The director may require a full description of the tests made and the results upon which the claims are based on a pesticide not registered federally or on a pesticide on which restrictions are being considered. For a renewal of registration, a statement is required only with respect to information which is different from that furnished when the pesticide was registered or last reregistered.\n\n(E) The director may prescribe other necessary information by regulation.\n\n(F) The applicant desiring to register a pesticide shall pay an annual registration fee in accordance with the provisions of Section 46-13-45.

The director by regulation shall establish provisions, which do not include reexamination unless required to do so by federal law, to ensure that private applicators continue to meet the requirements of changing technology and to ensure a continuing level of competence and ability to use pesticides safely and properly.\n\n(iv) If the director does not issue or renew a private applicator's license, he shall inform the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. The applicant is eligible for reexamination after thirty days.\n\n(2) Other applicators:\n\n(a) Application for a license must be made in writing to the director on a designated form obtained from the director's office. Each application for a license must contain information regarding the applicant's qualifications and proposed operations, the type of license (commercial or noncommercial), the license classification for which the applicant is applying, and must include the following:\n\n(i) the full name of the person applying for the license;\n\n(ii) the principal business address of the applicant in the State and elsewhere;\n\n(iii) the name and address of a person, who may be the Secretary of State, whose domicile is in the State, and who is authorized to receive and accept services of summons and legal notice of all kinds for the applicant;\n\n(iv) the type of equipment (excluding manually powered equipment) used by the applicant to apply pesticides.\n\n(b) The director may not issue a commercial or noncommercial applicator's license until the individual who uses or supervises the use of a restricted use pesticide is certified by passing an examination to demonstrate to the director his knowledge of how to use and supervise the use of pesticides under the classifications he has applied for, and his knowledge of the nature and effect of pesticides he may apply under those classifications.\n\n(c) If the deputy director finds the applicant qualified to use and supervise the use of pesticides in the classifications he has applied for, and if an applicant applying for a commercial applicator license files the evidence of financial responsibility required under Section 46-13-100, and if the applicant applying for a license to engage in aerial application of pesticides has met all of the requirements of the Federal Aviation Agency, the Division of Aeronautics of the Department of Commerce for the State, and any other applicable federal or state laws or regulations to operate the equipment described in the application, the deputy director shall issue a pesticide applicator's license limited to the classifications for which he is qualified, which shall expire at the end of the calendar year of issue unless it has been revoked or suspended prior thereto by the deputy director for cause. The deputy director may limit the license of the applicant to the use of certain areas, or to certain types of equipment if the applicant is only so qualified.\n\n(d) An applicator license issued to an individual representing a government entity or a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other juridical person, is valid only so long as that individual satisfying the examination requirement of Section 46-13-60(2)(b) is employed by the business, or is an official or employee of the governmental entity. A licensee shall notify the director within thirty days of the date of invalidation of a license pursuant to this provision. Supervision required by a licensee pursuant to this chapter must be performed only by an individual satisfying the examination requirement of Section 46-13-60(2)(b).\n\n(3) All persons:\n\n(a) No person (including officials or employees of federal, state, or local government) may use or supervise the use of a restricted use pesticide without a private, commercial, or noncommercial applicator license issued by the director.\n\n(b) An annual fee of fifty dollars for each pesticide applicator's license issued to each office at which records relative to the sale or application of pesticides are maintained is required. Payment of this annual fee permits the certification of one individual under any or all of the classifications. A five dollar annual fee is required to certify each additional applicant who desires to be certified in any one classification. Noncommercial applicators are exempt from all fee requirements.\n\n(c) If a license is not issued as applied for, the director shall inform the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial.\n\n(d) An applicant is eligible for reexamination after thirty days.\n\n(e) The license of an applicator whose financial responsibility, as required by Section 46-13-100 lapses, expires, or otherwise ceases to comply is suspended automatically until proof of continuing responsibility is provided by the applicator. It is unlawful for the person to engage in the business of applying pesticides until the financial responsibility is brought into compliance with the requirements of Section 46-13-100, and his license is reinstated by the director. If the applicator fails to reinstate his financial responsibility within three months or his applicator's license expires sooner, his license automatically is revoked and must not be restored until he has complied with the requirements of this section.\n\nHISTORY: 1975 (59) 284; 1979 Act No. 180 Sections 8, 9; 1990 Act No. 491, Section 1, eff May 29, 1990; 1992 Act No. 467, Section 2, eff July 1, 1992; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1163, eff July 1, 1993; 2008 Act No. 353, Section 2, Pt 30A.4, eff July 1, 2008.",

The director by regulation may increase the financial responsibility to not more than one hundred thousand dollars by category or classification. Financial responsibility must be maintained at not less than that sum at all times during the licensed period.
