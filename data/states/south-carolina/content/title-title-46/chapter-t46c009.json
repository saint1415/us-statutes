The owner of property destroyed or ordered to be treated or otherwise disposed of under this section, in an action against this State in the appropriate court for the county in which the property was located, may recover just compensation for property destroyed or the reasonable costs of disposal if he establishes that the property was not a pest, host, or infested article. The State has a lien, equal in dignity to a tax lien, on property treated to the extent of the value of the treatment provided, exclusive of the salary costs of commission employees. (B) The commission may quarantine the State or a portion of it when it determines that the action is necessary to prevent or retard the spread of a plant pest within or from this State and quarantine another state or portion of it whenever it determines a plant pest exists in it and that the action is necessary to prevent or retard its spread into this State. In quarantining in this State the commission is bound by the Administrative Procedures Act. In quarantining in another state the commission may rely upon a similar quarantine imposed by the appropriate agency of that state's government or the federal government, and the implementing regulation is exempt from submission to the General Assembly. However, the regulation automatically expires thirty days after the date of expiration of the quarantine upon which it was based. The commission may quarantine the entire State or may limit the quarantine to the infested area and the regulated area and without further hearing may extend or decrease the infested or the regulated areas, whether or not the new area is contiguous to the old, upon discovery of the plant pest in a new location. The action is effective upon publication of a notice to that effect in newspapers it selects in the newly-affected area or by direct written notice to those concerned. In delineating geographic areas under this section, the commission shall consider those geographic districts established by Section 22-2-190. (C) Following establishment of the quarantine, no person may move a regulated article described in the quarantine or move the plant pest against which the quarantine is established within, from, into, or through this State contrary to regulations promulgated by the commission. Notice of the regulations must be published in newspapers in the quarantined area the commission selects. The regulations may restrict the movement of the plant pest and regulated articles from the quarantined or regulated area in this State into or through other parts of this State or other states and from the quarantined or regulated area in other states into or through this State and shall impose inspection, disinfection, certification, or permit and other requirements the commission considers necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

(B) The director after opportunity for a hearing may deny, suspend, modify, or revoke a license or certificate for a violation of state or federal law or regulation. In addition to denial, suspension, revocation, or modification of a license or certificate or other penalty set forth in this chapter, any person subject to this chapter who violates this chapter or another chapter under the cognizance of the commission may be assessed a civil penalty by the director of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation. The director may suspend a license or certificate against which a civil penalty has been imposed if the license or certificate holder has not satisfied the penalty within thirty days after the license or certificate holder receives notification of the final decision of the director to impose the penalty. The license or certificate holder is entitled to a hearing on the suspension, but the suspension remains in effect pending the hearing and the decision of the director. Matters considered by the hearing officer are limited to whether a duly issued final order of the director existed, whether the license or certificate holder had notice of the final order, and whether the assessed penalty was paid within thirty days of the notice. A determination by the director is final unless within thirty days after the receipt of the notice of final determination the person adversely affected appeals to the Administrative Law Court as provided in Sections 1-23-380(B) and 1-23-600(D). The filing of a judicial appeal does not act as an automatic stay of enforcement of the civil penalty or of the suspension. (C) The commission may enforce its ordinances and regulations in a court of competent jurisdiction by civil as well as criminal proceedings. If it is necessary to issue a writ of injunction, no court of this State has the right previous to a trial upon the merits to set aside the writ on bond. The commission may utilize its own counsel or call upon the Attorney General or the appropriate solicitor, or all of the foregoing. The commission and its agents in the discharge of the duties and in the enforcement of the powers delegated in this chapter may administer oaths and hear witnesses, and to that end the sheriffs in the State shall serve all summonses and other papers upon the request of the commission.
