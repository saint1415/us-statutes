A copy of the complaint must be sent to the seller by certified or registered mail or as otherwise provided by state statute.\"\n\n(C) Effect of arbitration.\n\n(1) The report of arbitration is binding upon all parties who have agreed to binding arbitration in a contract governing the sale of the seed.\n\n(2) In the absence of an agreement to be bound by arbitration, a buyer may commence legal proceedings against a seller or assert the claim as a counterclaim or defense in an action brought by the seller, at any time after the receipt of the report of arbitration.\n\n(3) In litigation involving a complaint which has been the subject of arbitration pursuant to this section, a party may offer into evidence the facts of the arbitration report. The court may give weight to the committee's findings and recommendations as to damages and costs as the court may see fit based upon all the evidence before the court. The court also may consider the findings of the committee with respect to the failure of a party to cooperate in the arbitration proceedings, including the findings as to the effect of delay in filing the arbitration claim upon the committee's ability to determine the facts of the case.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 488, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 193, Section 1; 1976 Code Section 46-21-260; 2010 Act No. 238, Section 1, eff. upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on June 8, 2010).",
