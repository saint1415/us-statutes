The guarantees for other such nutrients must be expressed in the form of the element. The sources of such other nutrients (oxides, salt, chelates, etc.) are required upon registration and may be included as a parenthetical statement on the label. Other beneficial substances or compounds, determinable by laboratory methods, also may be guaranteed by permission of the commission.

The experimental design must be related to conditions applicable to South Carolina. The commission may request assistance from the Director of the Clemson Experiment Station or the Director of the Cooperative Extension Service or persons under their supervision for interpretation of data and for advice of the acceptability of data. Scientific data from any source may be used by the commission as a basis for acceptance or rejection of claims.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 3-503; 1952 Code Section 3-503; 1942 Code Section 6385; 1939 (41) 360; 1954 (48) 1509; 1978 Act No. 578 Section 2; 1988 Act No. 595, Section 2, eff June 1, 1988; 1992 Act No. 388, Section 3, eff May 15, 1992; 2005 Act No. 107, Section 2, eff June 1, 2005.",

The application for registration must be submitted to the commission on forms furnished by the commission. Upon approval by the commission or its authorized agent, a copy of the registration must be furnished to the applicant.\n\n(1) A person wishing to become a registrant, before engaging in business, shall secure a license or renewal from the commission or its authorized representative. The application for the license must be on forms furnished by and contain the information prescribed by the commission or its authorized representative. The application must be accompanied by an annual registration fee in accordance with the following schedule:\n\nTonnage Volume of Registrant License Fee 0-5,000 tons One hundred dollars 5,001-25,000 tons Two hundred dollars More than 25,000 tons Four Hundred dollars\n\nA new registrant shall pay a license fee of one hundred dollars. On renewal the fee must be based on the tonnage volume of the registrant in accordance with the schedule above. The tonnage is determined from the monthly tonnage reports filed by the registrant in accordance with this chapter. The license must be renewed annually and is effective from July first through June thirtieth of the following year. Fees must be paid by the first day of July of each calendar year. The license may be revoked for a violation of a provision of this chapter or regulations promulgated by the authority.\n\n(2) All brands and grades of specialty fertilizer offered for sale, sold, or distributed in this State must be registered on forms supplied by the commission or its agent. All specialty fertilizers sold or distributed in this State are subject to an annual registration fee of thirty dollars for each product.\n\n(B)(1) A person desiring to become a distributor of fertilizer as defined in this chapter, except for those distributing specialty fertilizers only in packages of forty pounds or less, shall obtain an annual permit from the commission before engaging in such business. The exception for specialty fertilizer sales does not include ammonium nitrate or urea as a single nutrient fertilizer. Permits shall not be required for persons distributing only specialty fertilizers in packages of forty pounds or less; however, no person shall distribute restricted fertilizers in any quantity without a restricted fertilizer permit. Applications for a permit to do such business in South Carolina shall be submitted on application forms furnished by the commission or its agent. Upon approval of the commission, a copy of the permit shall be furnished to the applicant and when furnished, shall authorize the person receiving it to do business as a distributor. All permits shall expire on June thirtieth of each year.\n\n(2) The two authorized categories of permits are a general fertilizer permit and a restricted fertilizer permit. A person who engages in the distribution of commercial fertilizers without a valid permit must have all commercial fertilizer placed under a stop sale order until a valid permit is obtained.\n\n(3) A general fertilizer permit authorizes the permit holder to engage in the distribution of commercial fertilizers except those determined by the commission to be restricted fertilizers as defined in this chapter. This permit category is included in the application of all fertilizer registrants. A person holding a general fertilizer permit may not engage in the distribution of restricted fertilizers. No fee will be charged for this permit.\n\n(4) A restricted fertilizer permit authorizes the permit holder to engage in the distribution of all commercial fertilizers, including those that are designated as restricted fertilizers. A restricted fertilizer permit holder may refuse to sell to persons attempting to purchase restricted fertilizers out of season, in unusual quantities, or under suspect purchase patterns. A restricted fertilizer permit holder must record a valid state or federal driver's license number, or other picture identification card number approved for purchaser identification use by the commission, for the purchaser of restricted fertilizer. This information and additional records as set forth by the commission must be maintained for a minimum of two years. A registrant may obtain this permit by indication of intent to distribute restricted fertilizers on the application for registration. No distributor or registrant shall supply restricted fertilizers to a distributor or other persons or entities for resale who do not hold a valid restricted fertilizer permit. The annual permit fee shall be two hundred fifty dollars. Fertilizer registrants shall not be subject to permitting fees.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding another provision of law, the Department of Motor Vehicles must provide to the director access to identifying information and drivers' license records as needed to verify the identity of permit holders and persons purchasing restricted fertilizer. For homeland security purposes, identifying information relating to the holder of a general or restricted fertilizer permit is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n(C) Except as provided in this section, a person who violates a provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is subject to the criminal penalties prescribed in Section 46-9-90(A) and the civil penalties prescribed by this chapter.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 3-511; 1952 Code Sections 3-512, 3-516; 1942 Code Sections 6354, 6360; 1939 (41) 360; 1954 (48) 1509; 1978 Act No. 578 Section 4; 1988 Act No. 595, Section 4, eff June 1, 1988; 1992 Act No. 388, Section 3, eff May 15, 1992; 2002 Act No. 340, Section 3, eff June 30, 2002; 2008 Act No. 353, Section 2, Pt 30A.1, eff July 1, 2008.",
