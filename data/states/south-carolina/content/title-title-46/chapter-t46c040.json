To verify his claim, the grain dealer shall present any evidence of loss including, but not limited to, scale tickets. The price for each bushel of grain must be established on the day of the loss and must be for the fair market value on that day at the location of loss.

(E) Upon approval of his claim by the department, the grain dealer shall subrogate his interest, if any, to the department in a cause of action against the debtor.

The loan is to be repaid from monies from the guaranty fund within five years of the date of the loan in five annual installments with interest at the rate provided in Section 34-31-20(A). In the event the department fails to make any loan payment to the Insurance Reserve Fund within the prescribed time, the payment must be paid from the state general fund. The participants in the loan shall execute a document approved by the State Treasurer severally guaranteeing the loan. The Insurance Reserve Fund shall prepare a written loan agreement which must be executed by the department prior to entering into the loan authorized by this section. (B) Any federal funds or other funds not derived from grain assessments received by the department to reimburse claims or losses under this chapter must be paid into the fund and used for loan payments or loan principal reduction to the extent any monies are due under subsection (A) to the Insurance Reserve Fund or the state general fund. Each grain dealer severally guaranteeing this loan shall have his pro rata share of the debt obligation reduced accordingly based on the amount of the federal or other payment. If no monies are due to the Insurance Reserve Fund or to the state general fund under subsection (A), such funds shall be used for claim payments.

If such grain dealers have received quantities of grain subject to assessments totaling less than fifty dollars in any calendar month, the assessments may be reported and remitted with the following month's return. All assessments must be remitted at least once every three months. (B) In case any person subject to this section fails to make a report and remittance when required, the department shall determine the amount of the assessment according to its best judgment and information and such amount shall be prima facie correct, and the person who failed to make the report, within ten days after notice of the amount of the assessment is mailed to him, shall pay the assessment, together with a penalty of ten percent, or dispute such assessment and request a hearing to determine its amount and the penalty to be imposed. No payment shall be made until the department enters its order determining the amount of the payment but the payment must be made within ten days' notice of the order.

      "text": "(A) From the effective date of this chapter until the time the department determines that all approved claims against the debtor as defined in Section 46-40-20(4) have been paid and that all monies received from the Insurance Reserve Fund or state general fund under Section 46-40-50 have been repaid in full with interest as required, all monies in the fund must be used only to pay claims against this debtor. At this time, the fund shall continue in the manner provided in this section, for the benefit of grain dealers who suffer losses against other debtors as a result of bankruptcy, embezzlement, or fraud with the monies in the fund at this time to be retained therein for this purpose. However, when all monies received from the Insurance Reserve Fund or state general fund under Section 46-40-50 have been repaid, the rate of assessment shall drop from two cents each bushel to one cent each bushel. (B) The assessments provided for in this chapter after the fund becomes available for the payment of claims against other debtors shall continue until the fund reaches three million dollars. If the three million dollar balance is attained prior to the end of harvest season, the assessments shall continue until the end of that season. However, a grain dealer who has not paid assessments into the fund, or forfeited collateral, in an amount at least equal to loss payments he has received, shall continue to pay assessments until the assessments equal the loss payments he received. The assessments shall be reinstated as necessary to maintain a balance of three million dollars in the fund. (C) Claims shall be paid in the order in which they are verified and approved by the department. If there is an insufficient amount of money in the fund to cover all claims, in the manner provided in this section, payments must be made on a pro rata basis up to one hundred percent of the total loss of each grain dealer. If payment is not received in the amount of one hundred percent of total loss, then additional amounts must be paid as funds become available until payment of one hundred percent of total loss is attained. However, a grain dealer may only receive payments for losses in an amount that does not exceed the total of the assessments he has paid into the fund and the value of collateral used to secure repayment of the loss payment. If, however, additional monies are deposited into the fund from grants or any other source, each grain dealer shall have his amount of outstanding debt reduced pro rata using these additional funds. If at any time a grain dealer receives payment for more than one hundred percent of total loss, such excess shall immediately be returned to the fund. (D) For purposes of paying claims, grain dealers must file their claims with the department within ninety days after their date of loss and the term \"debtor\" under this section means any grain dealer who has filed a petition for bankruptcy or who has committed embezzlement or fraud. Date of loss means the date the debtor filed a petition for bankruptcy or the date the department determined an embezzlement or fraud occurred, and the term \"loss\" does not include any monetary losses for grain delivered to the debtor more than one year before the date of loss. The department in pursuing claims subrogated by grain dealers who have received payments from the fund may hire independent attorneys to pursue these subrogated claims to be paid from any recovery or from monies in the fund. For losses resulting from an embezzlement or fraud, unless the grain dealer who occasioned the loss has been convicted of embezzlement or fraud pursuant to judicial proceedings, the department, in conjunction with the State Auditor's Office, shall conduct a financial audit of the grain dealer to verify the loss before it may request payment from the fund. The fund must bear all expenses incurred in conducting the audit. Otherwise, except as modified by the provisions of this section, the payment of assessments, claims, and the administration of the fund shall be as provided in this chapter and the provisions of this chapter shall apply to such transactions mutatis mutandis.
