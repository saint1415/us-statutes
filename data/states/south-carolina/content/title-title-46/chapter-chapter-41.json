      "text": "(A) The State Treasurer shall administer the investment of the fund. The department shall administer the collection of assessments and investigate losses for which payment is requested. Unless the agricultural commodity dealer who allegedly occasioned the loss has filed for bankruptcy or is audited pursuant to other judicial proceedings, the department, in conjunction with the State Auditor's Office, shall conduct a financial audit of the agricultural commodity dealer to verify the loss before it may request payment from the fund. The fund must bear all expenses incurred in conducting the audit. After verification, the department shall request that payment for verified losses be made by the State Treasurer to the person incurring a loss. The fund must be established for the benefit of producers who suffer losses on agricultural commodities for which they have paid assessments on, except losses covered by the agricultural commodity dealer's surety bond. When the fund reaches twenty-five million dollars, the assessment ceases. If the twenty-five million dollars is attained prior to the end of a harvest season, the assessment continues until the end of that season. The assessment must be reinstituted as necessary to maintain a balance of twenty-five million dollars in the fund. The first one hundred thousand dollars collected in assessment must be paid into the general fund of the State. Any of these funds not appropriated for the employment of additional auditors for the Warehouse and Dealers and Handlers Division of the Department of Agriculture must be returned to the fund. All income, interest, or otherwise, derived from this fund must be reinvested in the fund.\n\n(B) When a loss is incurred for an agricultural commodity for which assessments have been paid within two years of the date of loss, the producer shall within ninety days present his claim, which must be under oath, to the department on a form supplied by the department. To verify his claim, the producer shall present any evidence of loss the department considers necessary. The price for each bushel or bale of the agricultural commodity must be established on the day of the loss and must be for the fair market value on that day at the location of loss. The price for each bushel or bale may not be higher than the contract price, if a price has been established. All persons filing claims under this section are bound by the value determined by the department.\n\n(C) The department within thirty days from verification of loss shall request payment of one hundred percent of the approved claim. At no time may the fund be reduced to less than one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(D) If there is an insufficient amount of money in the fund to cover all claims, payments must be made on a pro rata basis up to one hundred percent of the total loss of each producer. The pro rata determination shall be based upon the producer's total loss amount as well as the total number of exemptions granted to the producer as set forth in Section 46-41-250. The more exemptions granted to a producer, the lower the share the producer will receive. Claims against the fund must be paid in the order in which they have been verified and approved.\n\n(E) Upon approval of his claim by the department, the producer shall subrogate his interest, if any, to the department in a cause of action against any and all parties. An independent law firm may be hired and paid by the fund for the purpose of collecting losses subrogated to the department. Payments start when the fund exceeds one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 156 Section 28; 1988 Act No. 435, eff April 5, 1988; 2022 Act No. 181 (S.1117), Section 1, eff May 16, 2022; 2023 Act No. 32 (S.603), Section 1, eff May 16, 2023.",
