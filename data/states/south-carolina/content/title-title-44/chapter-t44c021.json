      "text": "(A) It is the intent of the General Assembly that individuals with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities and their families be afforded supports that emphasize community living and enable them to enjoy typical lifestyles. One way to do this is to recognize that families are the greatest resource available to individuals with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities and that families must be supported in their role as primary caregivers. The General Assembly finds that supporting individuals and families in their effort to care for themselves or their family members at home is more efficient, cost-effective, and sensitive than maintaining people with intellectual disability or related disabilities in out-of-home residential settings. (B) The intent of the Family Support Services Program provided for in this chapter is to assist individuals with disabilities and their families who desire or choose to support a family member with intellectual disability or a related disability or head injury, spinal cord injury, or similar disability in their home. The program is not meant to create a hardship on a family by supplanting or diverting access from other appropriate or necessary services. It is recognized that persons with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities have the right to receive services from public and other agencies that provide services to South Carolina citizens and to have those services coordinated with the services needed because of their disabilities. It is the position of this State that children and adults have the right to live with their families. The individual's and family's circumstances and desires must be taken into account when considering the appropriate types of services or supports which can best meet the needs of the individual and family. (C) In recognition of the importance of families, the following principles must be used as guidelines in developing services to support families: (1) Families and individuals with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities are best able to determine their own needs and should be able to make decisions concerning necessary, desirable, and appropriate services. (2) Individuals and families should receive the support necessary to care for themselves or their family member at home. (3) Family support is needed throughout the lifespan of an individual with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities. (4) Family support services should be sensitive to the unique needs, strengths, and values of the individuals and the family and should be responsive to the needs of the entire family. (5) Family support should build on existing social networks and natural sources of support and should encourage community integration. (6) Family support services should be provided in a manner that develop comprehensive, responsive, and flexible support to individuals and families as their needs evolve over time. (7) Family support services should be coordinated across the numerous agencies likely to provide resources and services to individuals and families and should be provided equitably across the State. (8) Family, individual, and community-based services should be based on the principles of sharing ordinary places, developing meaningful relationships, learning things that are useful, making choices, as well as promoting an individual's self-esteem. (9) Family support services should be sufficient to enable families to keep their family members with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities at home or be sufficient to enable the individual with a disability to remain at home. (10) Services provided through the Family Support Program must be coordinated closely with services received from public and other agencies and shall foster collaboration and cooperation with all agencies providing services to individuals with intellectual disability or related disabilities or head injuries, spinal cord injuries, or similar disabilities. (D) The General Assembly recognizes that the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs for several years has developed and maintained a family support program that provides support services to some families with members with intellectual disability. The success of this program demonstrates the need and value of family support services. More families in the State should be able to receive appropriate services and assistance needed to stabilize the family unit.
