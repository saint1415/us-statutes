The State Department of Health and Human Services shall provide the number of Medicaid patient days available to the department within thirty days after the effective date of the annual appropriations act.\n\n(B) Based on a method the department develops for determining the need for nursing home care for Medicaid patients in each area of the State, the department shall determine the distribution of Medicaid patient days for which Medicaid nursing home permits can be issued. Nursing homes holding a Medicaid nursing home permit must be allocated Medicaid days based on their current allocation and available funds. Requests for days must be submitted to the department no later than June fifteenth each year. The department shall issue permits to the facilities by August first of each year. The application must state the specific number of Medicaid patient days the nursing home will provide. If a nursing home requests fewer days than the previous year, or is permitted fewer days, those days first must be offered to the facilities within the same county currently holding a Medicaid nursing home permit. However, if Medicaid patient days remain available after being offered to those nursing homes currently holding a Medicaid patient days permit in that county, then existing nursing homes with a restricted Certificate of Need, within the same county, may apply for a Medicaid nursing home permit to receive the Medicaid permit days remaining available. Following the initial allocation of Medicaid patient days, any additional Medicaid permit days must be credited to a statewide pool and the days must be allocated to those counties showing the greatest need based on the average number of fully eligible Medicaid nursing facility applicants by county in the Community Long Term Care awaiting placement reports for the past twelve months. The Department of Health and Human Services shall provide this information to the department no later than July fifteenth of each year. The Medicaid permit days must be proportionately allocated to each facility within the county that currently holds a Medicaid permit and is currently in compliance with its Medicaid permit. A facility is deemed to be in compliance for allocation of these additional Medicaid permit days if it has not exceeded its stated Medicaid permit by more than seven percent. In addition, a nursing home that provides less than ninety percent of the stated Medicaid permit in any fiscal year may not apply for additional Medicaid permit days in the next fiscal year. If a nursing home fails to provide ninety percent of the stated Medicaid permit days for two consecutive fiscal years, the department may issue a Medicaid nursing home permit for fewer days than requested in order to ensure that the nursing home will serve the minimum number of Medicaid patients and that the State will optimize the available Medicaid days. If a nursing home has its Medicaid patient days reduced, the freed days first must be offered to other facilities in the same county before being offered to other nursing homes in the State. The department shall analyze the performance of nursing homes that are under the permit minimum or exceed the permit maximum for a fiscal year, including utilization data from the State Department of Health and Human Services, anticipated back days, delayed payments, CLTC waiting list, and other factors considered significant by the department. A nursing home which terminates its Medicaid contract must not be penalized for not meeting the requirements of this section if the nursing home was in compliance with its permit at the time of the cancellation. Facilities designated as Special Focus Facilities may not be issued additional Medicaid permit days while they remain on the Special Focus list.\n\n(C) If the Department of Health and Human Services or the General Assembly decreases the number of Medicaid patient days available to the department, the department shall proportionately decrease the authorized Medicaid patient days for each nursing home. If additional Medicaid patient days are authorized in the following year, they must be restored proportionately to each nursing home in accordance with subsection (B).\n\nHISTORY: 1987 Act No. 184 Section 1; 1990 Act No. 612, Part II, Section 45; 1991 Act No. 171, Part II, Section 7; 1992 Act No. 501, Part II Section 53A; 1995 Act No. 145, Part II, Section 73A; 2014 Act No. 152 (H.3978), Section 1, eff April 7, 2014.",

Violations of this article include:\n\n(1) a nursing home exceeding by more than five percent the number of Medicaid patient days stated in its permit;\n\n(2) the provisions of any Medicaid patient days by a home without a Medicaid nursing home permit.\n\n(B) A nursing home which exceeds its Medicaid patient days stated in its permit may be fined on the number of Medicaid patient days exceeding the permit days multiplied by its daily Medicaid per diem. Medicaid permit days provided to Complex Care residents, as certified by the Department of Health and Human Services, must not be counted against the facility's Medicaid permit for the first six months of their care. Any complex care provided after six months must be counted toward the facility's Medicaid patient days under the permit days times their daily Medicaid per diem rate less the statewide average patient per diem recurring income times thirty percent. Complex Care reimbursement must not be used in the fine calculation. A facility may be fined incrementally for exceeding its Medicaid permit. Violations above five and up to ten percent of the stated permit may be fined at thirty percent of its Medicaid per diem rate less the statewide average patient per diem recurring income times the number of excess Medicaid permit days. A facility may be fined fifty percent of its Medicaid per diem rate less the statewide average patient per diem recurring income for each day above ten and up to fifteen percent of its Medicaid permit. A facility may be fined seventy percent of its Medicaid per diem rate less the statewide average patient per diem recurring income for each day in excess of fifteen percent of its stated Medicaid permit. A facility may appeal to the department any fine for days over its permit based on the facility's inability to discharge a resident based on the requirements of Section 44-7-88 if the facility can prove:\n\n(1) the resident's primary pay source upon admission was not Medicaid;\n\n(2) the resident did not convert to Medicaid within twenty days of being admitted as a Medicare or Medicaid replacement policy resident; and\n\n(3) the resident did not convert to Medicaid within thirty days of being admitted as a private pay resident.\n\n(C) In the event of a voluntary or involuntary discontinuation of participation of a nursing facility in the Medicaid program, the State must ensure that the facility provides for patient safety and freedom of choice. The Department of Health and Environmental Control and the Department of Health and Human Services must determine the availability of existing patient days statewide for the purpose of relocating these patients. Based upon this determination, the department, at its discretion, may reallocate the patient days from a facility discontinuing its Medicaid participation to a facility that participates in the Medicaid program and agrees to accept the residents from the facility that is discontinuing Medicaid participation. The Medicaid permit day shall permanently remain with the facility accepting the resident. In the allocation of patient days from the facility discontinuing Medicaid participation, the department must give first priority to restoring a county's allocation where a facility holding a permit closes, or discontinues participation in Medicaid. A nursing home receiving beds under the provisions of this subsection must not be a Special Focus Facility at the time of allocation.\n\n(D) Effective July 1, 2014, all nursing facility providers holding a Medicaid permit must report their daily Medicaid resident census information to the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services or its contractor for the purpose of maintaining a statewide bed locator and permit day tracking system.\n\n(E) Each Medicaid day above the allowable range is considered a separate violation. A fine assessed against a nursing home must be deducted from the nursing home's Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nHISTORY: 1987 Act No. 184 Section 1; 1995 Act No. 145, Part II, Section 73B; 2014 Act No. 152 (H.3978), Section 1, eff April 7, 2014.",

It is characterized by tremor at rest, slow movements, muscle rigidity, stooped posture, and unsteady or shuffling gait.\n\n(b) \"Parkinsonism\" means one or more related conditions that cause a combination of the movement abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease, such as tremor at rest, slow movement, muscle rigidity, impaired speech or muscle stiffness, which often overlap with and can evolve from what appears to be Parkinson's disease. Examples of parkinsonism of particular interest include, but are not exclusive to, the following: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).\n\n(3) The database and system of collection and dissemination of information must be under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer of MUSC, who may enter into contracts, grants, or other agreements as are necessary for the collection of the data.\n\n(B)(1) Every patient diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or a related parkinsonism must be notified about the database and the opportunity to participate as provided in this subsection, but no patient may be forced to participate.\n\n(2) A physician who diagnoses a patient with Parkinson's disease or related parkinsonism, as advised by the advisory committee established pursuant to item (3), shall notify the patient orally and in writing about the database and the opportunity to participate by allowing for the collection of information and patient data on Parkinson's disease. If a patient does not wish to participate, the physician shall certify in writing that the patient has been notified of the opportunity, and has been provided information about the operation of the database and afforded the opportunity to ask questions, but has declined.\n\n(3) MUSC shall establish a Parkinson's Disease Database Advisory Committee to assist in the development and implementation of the database; determine what data must be collected; and generally, advise MUSC. Membership of the committee must include at least one general neurologist, one movement disorder specialist, one primary care physician, one physician who practices clinical informatics, Parkinson's patients, public health staff, population health researchers familiar with such databases, Parkinson's disease researchers, and anyone else MUSC deems necessary.\n\n(C) MUSC shall establish a system for the collection and dissemination of information determining the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease and related parkinsonism, as advised by the advisory committee. MUSC shall designate Parkinson's disease and related parkinsonism as advised by the advisory committee as diseases required to be reported in the State or any part of the State. All cases of Parkinson's disease diagnosed or treated in South Carolina must be reported to MUSC. However, the mere incidence of a patient with Parkinson's is the sole required information for this database for any patient who chooses not to participate. For the subset of patients who choose not to participate, no further data may be reported to the database. MUSC may create, review, and revise a list of data points required as part of mandated Parkinson's disease reporting pursuant to this section. This list must include, but not be limited to, necessary triggering diagnostic conditions, consistent with the latest International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, and resulting case data including, but not limited to, diagnosis, medical treatment, treatment, and survival. MUSC may implement and administer this subsection through a bulletin or similar instruction.\n\n(D) MUSC shall provide notification of the mandatory reporting of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism on its website and also shall provide that information to associations representing physicians and hospitals and directly to the Board of Medical Examiners at least one hundred eighty days prior to requiring information be reported.\n\n(E) A hospital, facility, physician, surgeon, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other health care provider deemed necessary by MUSC diagnosing Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism patients shall report each case of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism to MUSC in a format prescribed by MUSC. MUSC is authorized to enter into data sharing contracts with data reporting entities and their associated electronic medical record systems vendors to securely and confidentially receive information related to Parkinson's disease testing, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n(F) MUSC may enter into agreements to furnish data collected in this database to other states' Parkinson's disease registries, federal Parkinson's disease control agencies, local health officers, or health researchers for the study of Parkinson's disease. Before confidential information is disclosed to those agencies, officers, researchers, or out-of-state registries, the requesting entity shall agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and in the case of researchers, also shall do both of the following:\n\n(1) obtain approval of the respective committee for the protection of human subjects established in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 46.101; and\n\n(2) provide documentation to MUSC that demonstrates to MUSC's satisfaction that the entity has established the procedures and ability to maintain the confidentiality of the information.\n\n(G) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all information collected pursuant to this section is confidential. For purposes of this section, this information must be referred to as confidential information. To ensure privacy, MUSC shall promulgate a coding system that removes any identifying information about the patient.\n\n(H) Notwithstanding another provision of law, a disclosure authorized by this section may include only the information necessary for the stated purpose of the requested disclosure, used for the approved purpose, and not be further disclosed.\n\n(I) Provided the security of confidentiality has been documented, the furnishing of confidential information to MUSC or its authorized representative in accordance with this section does not expose any person, agency, or entity furnishing information to liability, and may not be considered a waiver of any privilege or a violation of a confidential relationship.\n\n(J) MUSC shall maintain an accurate record of all persons who are given access to confidential information. The record must include:\n\n(1) the name of the person authorizing access;\n\n(2) name, title, address, and organizational affiliation of persons given access;\n\n(3) dates of access; and\n\n(4) the specific purpose for which information is to be used. The record of access must be open to public inspection during normal operating hours of MUSC.\n\n(K)(1) Notwithstanding another provision of law, the confidential information may not be disclosed, is not discoverable, and may not be compelled to be produced in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other proceeding. The confidential information is not admissible as evidence in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other tribunal or court for any reason.\n\n(2) This subsection does not prohibit the publication by MUSC of reports and statistical compilations that do not in any way identify individual cases or individual sources of information.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subsection, the individual to whom the information pertains has access to his own information.\n\n(L) This section does not preempt the authority of facilities or individuals providing diagnostic or treatment services to patients with Parkinson's disease to maintain their own facility-based Parkinson's disease databases or registries.\n\n(M) MUSC is responsible for any costs incurred in implementing the provisions of this section.\n\nHISTORY: 2022 Act No. 211 (S.1011), Section 2, eff May 23, 2023.",
