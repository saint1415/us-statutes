      "text": "(A) Except as provided for in Sections 56-5-2930 and 56-5-2950, if a law enforcement officer observes a person conducting himself in a manner that causes the law enforcement officer to reasonably believe that the person is mentally ill or is suffering from chemical dependency and because of that condition poses a likelihood of serious harm to himself or others or if a criminal offense that carries a penalty of less than one year and that does not involve a victim who could seek a warrant for the person's arrest has occurred, the law enforcement officer may take the person into protective custody and transport the person to the local mental health center or a crisis stabilization program, if available in their jurisdictions, for examination and pre-admission screening and evaluation of psychiatric and chemical dependency emergencies.\n\n(B) Upon arrival at the mental health center or a crisis stabilization program, if available in their jurisdictions, the law enforcement officer who took the person into protective custody pursuant to this section shall complete a written affidavit under oath pursuant to Section 44-17-410(1). If the person is subsequently the subject of a hearing, and if the law enforcement officer who completed the affidavit is given notice of the hearing pursuant to Section 44-17-550, the officer may, but is not required to, appear at the hearing.\n\n(C) The local mental health center or a crisis stabilization program, if available in their jurisdictions, shall arrange for an examination of the person in protective custody by a licensed physician. The center or crisis stabilization program, if available in their jurisdictions, may detain the person for up to twenty-four hours for the purpose of psychiatric evaluation and examination by a licensed physician. If within twenty-four hours of being taken into protective custody the person is not examined by a licensed physician, or if upon examination the physician does not execute the certification provided for in Section 44-17-410(2), the person in protective custody must be released. If the physician examining the person completes the certification provided for in Section 44-17-410(2), the center or crisis stabilization program, if available in their jurisdictions, may continue to detain the person pending transportation by a law enforcement officer to the hospital designated by the certification, as provided for in Section 44-17-440.\n\n(D) The taking of a person into protective custody pursuant to this section is not an arrest. The officer shall inform the person that he or she is being held in protective custody and is not under arrest. However, a law enforcement officer taking an individual into protective custody may use that kind and degree of force necessary, including reasonable precautions for self-protection.\n\n(E) Except when a person is injured as a result of intentional injury, gross negligence, or a wanton disregard for their personal safety, a law enforcement officer, examining physician, or staff person of a mental health center or a designated facility who acts in accordance with this section is immune from civil liability.\n\n(F) For purposes of this section, \"crisis stabilization program\" means a community-based psychiatric program providing short-term, intensive, mental health treatment in a nonhospital setting for persons who are experiencing a psychiatric crisis and who are either unable to safely function in their daily lives or are a potential threat to themselves or the community, with treatment available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n(G) A law enforcement officer may transport a person as provided in this section to a local mental health center or a crisis stabilization program beyond the officer's jurisdiction if the law enforcement agency employing the officer has a written memo of understanding with the local mental health center or crisis stabilization program receiving the person taken into custody.\n\n(H) For purposes of this section, \"local mental health center or crisis stabilization program\" includes such center or program in an adjoining county or if there is not such a center or program in an adjoining county, then such a center or program in the nearest location.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 120, Section 3, eff June 3, 2005.",
