The affidavit must be accompanied by a written certificate of a licensed physician stating that he has examined the person within forty-eight hours prior to his admission, and is of the opinion, for stated reasons, that the person is a chemically dependent person and that the immediacy of the situation and consideration of safety do not allow initiation of judicial proceedings for involuntary commitment under Section 44-52-70. If a person refuses to submit to an examination, or may not be examined because his whereabouts are unknown or for any other reason, the person seeking emergency admission shall execute a written affidavit stating that he believes the person to be chemically dependent, and because of this condition, poses a substantial risk of harm to himself or others if not immediately hospitalized, the grounds for the belief, and that the usual procedure for examination may not be followed and the reason therefor. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the court may issue an order requiring any law enforcement officer to take a person into custody for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours. The order expires seventy-two hours after it was issued, and if the person is not taken into custody within those seventy-two hours, the order is no longer valid. During the detention he must be examined by a licensed physician. If within the twenty-four hours the person in custody is not examined by a licensed physician or, if upon examination, the physician does not execute the certificate required, the proceedings must be terminated and the individual in custody must be immediately released. The written certificate and affidavit shall authorize and require any law enforcement officer to transport the person to a treatment facility if confirmation has been obtained from the treatment facility that a bed is available. A person taken into custody for emergency admission may not be placed in a jail or other correctional facility except for protective custody purposes and only while awaiting transportation to a treatment facility. Any friend or relative may transport the person to a treatment facility, provided such friend or relative has read and signed a statement on the certificate which clearly states that it is the responsibility of a law enforcement officer to provide timely transportation for the person and that the friend or relative freely chooses to assume such responsibility. A friend or relative who chooses to transport the person shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the State for the cost of such transportation. Any officer acting in accordance with the provisions of this article shall be immune from civil liability. A copy of the written certificate and affidavit must be personally served upon the person upon admission to the facility, and a copy must be maintained in the person's medical record at the facility.

(B) Within forty-eight hours of receipt of the documents and information from the treatment facility, the court shall conduct a preliminary review of all the evidence to determine if probable cause exists to continue the emergency detention of the patient. If the court finds that probable cause does not exist, it shall issue an order that the patient be discharged immediately from the facility.
