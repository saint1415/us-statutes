      "text": "The State of South Carolina recognizes that a person with intellectual disability, a related disability, head injury, or spinal cord injury is a person who experiences the benefits of family, education, employment, and community as do all citizens. It is the purpose of this chapter to assist persons with intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, or spinal cord injuries by providing services to enable them to participate as valued members of their communities to the maximum extent practical and to live with their families or in family settings in the community in the least restrictive environment available. When persons with intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, or spinal cord injuries cannot live in communities or with their families, the State shall provide quality care and treatment in the least restrictive environment practical. In order to plan and coordinate state and locally funded services for persons with intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, or spinal cord injuries, a statewide network of local boards of disabilities and special needs is established. Services will be delivered to clients in their homes or communities through these boards and other local providers. It is recognized that persons with intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, or spinal cord injuries have the right to receive services from public and other agencies that provide services to South Carolina citizens and to have those services coordinated with the services needed because of their disabilities. South Carolina recognizes the value of preventing intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, and spinal cord injuries through education and research and supports efforts to this end. The State recognizes the importance of the role of parents and families in shaping services for persons with intellectual disability, related disabilities, head injuries, or spinal cord injuries as well as the importance of providing services to families to enable them to care for a family member with these disabilities. Admission to services of the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs does not terminate or reduce the rights and responsibilities of parents. Parental involvement and participation in mutual planning with the department to meet the needs of the client facilitates decisions and treatment plans that serve the best interest and welfare of the client.

Upon filing of the petition, the judge shall set a date for a hearing on it and ensure that the client has an attorney who represents him. The parents, parent with legal custody, spouse, guardian, or nearest known relative of the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability and in whose behalf the petition has been made and in the discretion of the court, the individual alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability and the department must be served by the court with a written notice of the time and place of the hearing, together with a written statement of the matters stated in the petition. If no parent, spouse, legal guardian, or known relative of the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability is found, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability, and the notice must be served upon the guardian. If the parent, spouse, guardian, or known relative of the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability is found, he must be notified of the right to an attorney at the hearing. (B) The hearing on the petition may be in the courthouse or at the place of residence of the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability or at another place considered appropriate by the court. The person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability does not need to be present if the court determines that the hearing would be injurious or detrimental to the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability or if the person's mental or physical condition prevents his participation in the hearing. However, his attorney must be present. (C) A report of the person in charge of the examination of the person alleged to have intellectual disability or a related disability at the diagnostic center referred to in \"Requirement for Admission\" must be submitted to the court at the hearing. The court may not render judgment in the hearing unless this report is available and introduced. (D) If the court determines that the evidence presented by the examiners at the diagnostic center, along with other evidence presented to the court, is to the effect that the person does not in fact have intellectual disability or a related disability to an extent which would require commitment, it shall terminate the proceeding and dismiss the petition. (E) If the person is found by the court to have intellectual disability or a related disability and be in need of placement in a facility or service program of the department, the court shall order that he be admitted to the jurisdiction of the department as soon as necessary services are available and include in the order a summary of the evidence presented and order of the court. (F) The department shall inform the court as soon after the date of the order as practical that suitable accommodations and services are available to meet the needs of the person with intellectual disability or a related disability. Upon notification, the court shall direct the petitioner in these proceedings to transport the person with intellectual disability or a related disability to a program the department designates. (G) A party to these proceedings may appeal from the order of the court to the court of common pleas, and a trial de novo with a jury must be held in the same manner as in civil actions unless the petitioner through his attorney waives his right to a jury trial.
