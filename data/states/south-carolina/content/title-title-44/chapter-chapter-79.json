Assignment of the promissory note does not affect the right of the member to cancel the contract or the method by which the cancellation may be made;\n\n(5) the contract must contain a right to cancel provision in the following language:\n\n\"CUSTOMER'S RIGHT TO CANCEL\n\n(a) You may cancel this contract by sending notice of your wish to cancel to the center before midnight of the third business day after you sign the contract. 'Business day' means Monday through Friday excluding state holidays and federal holidays. This notice must be sent certified mail to the following:\n\n______________________________\n\nWithin thirty days of receipt of this notice, the center shall return any payments made and any note or other evidence of indebtedness. If you use the seller's facilities or services, the center may deduct a reasonable fee from the payments being returned based on the actual fee paid divided on a pro rata share by the number of days used by the customer.\n\n(b) In addition, you or your estate may also cancel the contract at any time by written notice to the center at the above address if the following circumstances occur:\n\n(1) the customer's death;\n\n(2) substantial physical disability, certified by a physician, which makes it permanently impossible for the customer to use the center's services;\n\n(3) the customer's permanent relocation to a residence over fifty miles distant from an outlet operated by the center, if the center is unable to arrange for the customer's use of another center with equivalent major facilities and services.\n\nThe center may require presentation of information to substantiate that one of these circumstances has occurred.\n\nIf the contract is cancelled because of disability, death, or permanent change of residence, the center shall return any note or other evidence of indebtedness and unearned prepayments as follows: For each month that the contract was in effect, the center is entitled to the rate a month or a treatment which it would have charged if the contract had initially been one for the number of months or the number of treatments for which the contract was actually in effect. The rate is to be determined from a fee schedule in effect on the date of the contract.\n\n(c) The right of cancellation shall affect only the financial obligations under the contract and customer's right to use the center's physical fitness services.\"\n\n(6) services such as personal training, personal fitness testing, and daily visitor fees that are not subject to being refunded must be clearly stated in the contract;\n\n(7) Any contractual provision allowing more liberal rights of cancellation than set forth in this chapter may be substituted for the notice required in this chapter.\n\n(B) A contract is not required for personal training, private consultations, and fitness testing rendered on an hourly basis unless they are part of a package of over three hundred dollars.\n\nHISTORY: 1985 Act No. 165, Section 1; 1992 Act No. 380, Section 1; 1994 Act No. 312, Section 1.",

In the event the center is controlled by, under common control with, or controls other corporations and the other corporation agrees in writing to satisfy the claims against a bond allowed under this section, the financial responsibility of the other corporation must be considered in determining the requirement for a bond. In determining whether the center has the requisite financial responsibility, the administrator may consider the operating and business history, reputation, and management within and without the State, as well as the operating and business history and reputation of any business controlled by, under common control with, or controlling the center. The provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply to physical fitness service facilities that have been in operation for five years or more on the effective date of this Chapter.\n\n(3) Each center is required to notify the administrator upon substantial change of its financial status and to submit an annual report.\n\n(4) No person may offer physical fitness services in this State without first obtaining a certificate of authority from the administrator. A certificate of authority must be issued by the administrator upon submission of items (a) through (f) of this section. The applicant must submit:\n\n(a) A formal application for the certificate in such form and detail as the administrator requires.\n\n(b) A certified copy of its charter or articles of incorporation and its bylaws, if any.\n\n(c) If a corporation, a certified copy of the certificate of authority or good standing certificate from the Secretary of State of South Carolina.\n\n(d) A copy of its membership agreement.\n\n(e) A copy of any contract to be issued.\n\n(f) A list of outlets at which physical fitness services will be offered.\n\n(g) Any other relevant information required by the administrator.\n\n(5) No certificate of authority may be issued by the administrator until the center pays an initial certificate of authority fee of fifty dollars an outlet. Certificates of authority may be renewed upon payment of an annual renewal fee of fifty dollars an outlet on or before December thirty-first.\n\n(6) A copy of the Certificate of Authority required by this chapter must be posted conspicuously at every location where monies or contracts are received by the center.\n\n(7) It is unlawful for any center or person acting on behalf of a center required to obtain and maintain a Certificate of Authority under this chapter to advertise, sell, or offer to sell the use of physical fitness services when a valid certificate is not on file with the administrator.\n\n(8) The administrator may file a request for a contested case hearing with the Administrative Law Court to obtain a cease and desist order or an order revoking, suspending, or vacating the certificate of authority of a center, if the department determines that the center has violated or failed to comply with any provision of this chapter or regulation promulgated under the authority of this chapter or if the department shows that:\n\n(a) a document or declaration required by subsection (4), items (a) through (g) were false or misleading; or\n\n(b) by clear and convincing evidence the center or its agents, officers, or employees have engaged in false, fraudulent, or deceptive conduct in its dealings with customers.\n\n(9) Instead of revocation, suspension, or refusal to continue a certificate of authority of a center, the administrative law judge may assess an administrative penalty for a violation of subsection (4) or (8) of this section not to exceed five hundred dollars for each violation, not to exceed five thousand dollars for matters commenced in any calendar year.
