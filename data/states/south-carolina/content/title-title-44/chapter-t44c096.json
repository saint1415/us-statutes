      "text": "(A) The General Assembly finds that: (1) Over three million eight hundred thousand tons of solid waste are generated in South Carolina each year. (2) On the average, each South Carolinian currently produces approximately four and one-half pounds of solid waste each day. (3) Unless steps are taken to reduce or recycle the amount of waste produced in this State, over five million tons of solid waste will be generated annually in South Carolina by the year 2000. (4) Approximately eighty percent of the solid waste generated in South Carolina is landfilled. (5) There are currently some seventy-nine permitted sanitary landfills in this State. (6) Most of the permitted landfill capacity will be used within the next ten years. Twenty-three of forty-six counties have ten years or less of landfill space remaining. (7) Siting of solid waste facilities is becoming increasingly difficult due to the opposition of local residents. (8) The costs of solid waste management will increase significantly due to decreased landfill capacity and more stringent federal requirements for solid waste management facilities. More stringent federal and state requirements may also force a number of existing solid waste landfills to close. (9) Insufficient and improper methods of managing solid waste can create hazards to public health, cause pollution of air and water resources, constitute a waste of natural resources, and create public nuisances. (10) The economic growth and population growth of our State have required increased industrial production which, together with related commercial and agricultural operations to meet our needs, have resulted in increased amounts of discarded materials. (11) The continuing technological progress and improvements in methods of manufacturing, packaging, and marketing of consumer products have resulted in an increasing amount of material discarded by the purchasers of these products, necessitating a statewide approach to assist local governments in improving solid waste management practices and to promote more efficient methods of solid waste management. (12) The failure or inability to economically recover material and energy resources from solid waste results in the unnecessary waste and depletion of our natural resources, such that maximum resource recovery from solid waste and maximum recycling and reuse of these resources must be considered goals of the State. (13) A coordinated statewide solid waste management program is needed to protect public health and safety, protect and preserve the quality of the environment, and conserve and recycle natural resources. (14) The statewide solid waste management program should be implemented through the preparation of a state solid waste management plan and through the preparation by local governments of solid waste management plans consistent with the state plan and with this chapter. (B) It is the purpose of this article to: (1) protect the public health and safety, protect and preserve the environment of this State, and recover resources which have the potential for further usefulness by providing for, in the most environmentally safe, economically feasible and cost-effective manner, the storage, collection, transport, separation, treatment, processing, recycling, and disposal of solid waste; (2) establish and maintain a cooperative state program for providing planning assistance, technical assistance, and financial assistance to local governments for solid waste management; (3) require local governments to adequately plan for and provide efficient, environmentally acceptable solid waste management services and programs; (4) promote the establishment of resource recovery systems that preserve and enhance the quality of air, water, and land resources; (5) ensure that solid waste is transported, stored, treated, processed, and disposed of in a manner adequate to protect human health, safety, and welfare and the environment; (6) promote the reduction, recycling, reuse, and treatment of solid waste, and the recycling of materials which would otherwise be disposed of as solid waste; (7) encourage local governments to utilize all means reasonably available to promote efficient and proper methods of managing solid waste, which may include contracting with private entities to provide management services or operate management facilities on behalf of the local government, when it is cost effective to do so; (8) promote the education of the general public and the training of solid waste professionals to reduce the generation of solid waste, to ensure proper disposal of solid waste, and to encourage recycling; (9) encourage the development of waste reduction and recycling programs through planning assistance, technical assistance, grants, and other incentives; (10) encourage the development of the state's recycling industries by promoting the successful development of markets for recycled items and by promoting the acceleration and advancement of the technology used in manufacturing processes that use recycled items; (11) establish a leadership role for the State in recycling efforts by requiring the General Assembly, the Governor's Office, the Judiciary, and all state agencies to separate solid waste for recycling and by granting a preference in state procurement policies to products with recycled content; (12) require counties to develop and implement source separation, resource recovery, or recycling programs, or all of the above, or enhance existing programs so that valuable materials may be returned to productive use, energy and natural resources conserved, and the useful life of solid waste management facilities extended; (13) require local governments and state agencies to determine the full cost of providing storage, collection, transport, separation, treatment, recycling, and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally safe manner; and (14) encourage local governments to pursue a regional approach to solid waste management.

      "text": "(A) It is the policy of this State to promote appropriate methods of solid waste management prior to utilizing the options of disposal in landfills, treatment or disposal by incineration or other treatment, storage, or disposal methods, and to assist local government with solid waste management functions. In furtherance of this state policy, it shall be preferable to reduce the production and generation of waste at the source and to promote the reuse and recycling of materials rather than the treatment, storage, or disposal of wastes by landfill disposal, incineration, or other management methods designed to handle waste after it enters the waste stream. It is the policy of this State that the methods of management of solid waste shall protect public health, safety, and the environment by employing the best available technology which is economically feasible for the control of pollution and the release of hazardous constituents into the environment. Such methods shall be implemented in a manner to maximize the reduction of solid waste through source reduction, reuse, and recycling. (B) It is the policy of this State to encourage research by private entities, by state agencies, and by state-supported educational institutions into the reduction of solid waste production and generation. (C) It is the policy of this State to encourage a regional approach to solid waste management. (D) It is the goal of this State to reduce, on a statewide per capita basis, the amount of municipal solid waste being generated to 3.5 pounds per day not later than June 30, 2005. (E) It is the goal of this State to recycle, on a statewide basis, at least thirty-five percent, calculated by weight, of the municipal solid waste stream generated in this State no later than June 30, 2005. (F) It is the goal of this State to continue setting new and revised solid waste recycling and waste reduction goals after June 30, 2005. These goals must be established in a manner so as to attempt to further reduce the flow of solid waste being disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills and solid waste incinerators. (G) It is the policy of this State that each county or region make every effort to meet, on an individual basis, the state solid waste recycling and reduction goals and that each county or region, and municipalities located therein, which meet this goal be financially rewarded by the State. (H) For the purposes of Sections 44-96-50 and 44-96-60, \"municipal solid waste\" includes, but is not limited to, wastes that are durable goods, nondurable goods, containers and packaging, food scraps, yard trimmings, and miscellaneous inorganic wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources including, but not limited to, appliances, automobile tires, old newspapers, clothing, disposable tableware, office and classroom paper, wood pallets, and cafeteria wastes. \"Municipal solid waste\" does not include solid wastes from other sources including, but not limited to, construction and demolition debris, auto bodies, municipal sludges, combustion ash, and industrial process wastes that also might be disposed of in municipal waste landfills or incinerators.

      "text": "(A) Not later than fifteen months after the date on which the department submits its state solid waste management plan to the Governor and to the General Assembly, the governing body of each county, if the county intends to submit a single county plan, or the governing bodies of the counties in a region, if two or more counties intend to submit a regional plan, in cooperation with the local governments located in the county or region, shall prepare a solid waste management plan for the area within that county or region. Local governments within the county or region shall participate in the development of the county or regional plan and are required to be a part of the plan. This plan must provide for public participation and include, at a minimum, the following: (1) an estimate of the amount of solid waste currently disposed of at solid waste disposal facilities within that county or region and a projection of the amount of solid waste which will be disposed of at solid waste disposal facilities during the twenty-year period following this chapter's effective date; (2) an estimate of the current capacity within that county or region to manage solid waste, including identification of each solid waste management facility and a projection of its useful life; (3) an analysis of the existing and new solid waste facilities which will be needed to manage the solid waste generated within that county or region during the projected twenty-year period; (4) an estimate of the cost of implementing the solid waste management plan within that county or region; (5) an estimate of the revenue which each local government or region needs and intends to make available to fund implementation of the solid waste management plan; (6) an estimate of the cost of siting, constructing, and bringing into operation any new facilities needed to manage solid waste within that county or region during the projected twenty-year period; (7) a description and estimate of the sources and amount of revenues which can be made available for the siting, construction, and operation of new solid waste management facilities; (8) a description of resource recovery, or recycling program, or both, which shall be implemented in each county or region which shall include, at a minimum, the following: (a) the designation of a recycling coordinator; (b) an identification of the categories of solid waste materials to be source separated, recovered, recycled, or all of the above; (c) an identification of the means by which such materials will be collected and marketed; (d) a description of the incentives or penalties, or both, that will be used to ensure compliance with the recycling program; and (e) a description of the public education program which will be used to inform the public of the need for and benefits of source separation, recovery, and recycling and of the requirements of the recycling program. A county or region may be exempted from the requirements of Section 44-96-80(A)(8)if it provides sufficient justification to the department that the implementation of a source separation, resource recovery, recycling program, or all of the above within that county or region is economically infeasible or impracticable or that such program is unnecessary for the county or region to meet the waste recycling and reduction goals established in Section 44-96-50; and (9) a description of efforts, in addition to the recycling program, which will be undertaken within that county or region to meet the solid waste reduction goal as established on a statewide basis in Section 44-96-50. (B) Each county or region shall submit its solid waste management plan to the department for review. The department shall have one hundred eighty days from the date on which a plan is submitted to review the plan and provide comments to the submitting entity. At the end of the one hundred eighty-day review period, the county or region shall begin implementation of its solid waste management plan. Such plan must be implemented not later than one year after the end of the one hundred eighty-day review period. (C) Each solid waste management plan submitted by a county or region shall be designed to achieve within that county or region the same recycling and waste reduction goals established on a statewide basis in Section 44-96-50. Nothing in this chapter, however, prohibits a county or region from setting higher percentage goals for recycling and waste reduction in its solid waste management plan than the goals established in Section 44-96-50. The department may reduce or modify the statewide goals as they apply to a county or region to account for industrial growth or other good cause shown. However, reduction or modification must not result in a failure to meet the recycling and reduction goals on a statewide basis as established in Section 44-96-50. (D) Each county or region submitting a solid waste management plan containing a source separation, resource recovery, recycling programs, or all of the above to the department shall provide its residents with the opportunity to recycle the categories of solid waste materials designated in the county or regional solid waste management plan. The opportunity to recycle may include one or more of the following: (1) curbside collection systems; (2) drop-off centers; (3) collection centers; or (4) collection systems for multi-family residences. (E) Each solid waste management plan submitted pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the state solid waste management plan, with the provisions of this chapter, with all other applicable provisions of state law, and with any regulation promulgated by the department for the protection of public health and safety or for protection of the environment. (F) Each county or region submitting a solid waste management plan to the department shall thereafter submit an annual progress report to the department by a date to be determined by the department. The annual report shall contain information as may be requested by the department but must contain, at a minimum, the following: (1) any revisions to the solid waste management plan previously submitted by the county or region; (2) the amount of waste disposed of at municipal solid waste disposal facilities during the previous year by type of waste; (3) the percentage reduction each year in solid waste disposed of at municipal solid waste disposal facilities; (4) the amount, type, and percentage of materials that were recycled, if any, during the previous year; (5) the percentage of the population participating in various types of source separation, recovery, or recycling activities during the previous year; and (6) a description of the source separation, recovery, or recycling activities or all of the above activities attempted, if any, their success rates, the reasons for their success or failure, and a description of such activities which are ongoing. (G) Counties are strongly encouraged to pursue a regional approach to solid waste management. Nothing in this chapter, however, shall be construed to require a county to participate in a regional plan or to prohibit two or more counties within the State which are not contiguous from preparing, approving, and submitting a regional solid waste management plan or one or more counties, including industrial waste generators located therein, from contracting with an in-state solid waste disposal facility located outside of the county or region. Not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment of this chapter, each county shall notify the department in writing whether it intends to submit a single county solid waste management plan or to participate in a regional plan. (H) Local governments may enter into cooperative agreements with other local governments to provide for the collection, separation, or recycling of solid waste at mutually agreed upon sites. Local governments may expend funds received from any source to establish and maintain such regional facilities and to provide for sharing the costs of establishing and maintaining such facilities in an equitable manner. (I) Each county or region shall ensure that all their local governments participate in the preparation and implementation of the solid waste management plan, including the source separation, resource recovery, or recycling program, or all of the above. (J) The governing body of a county has the responsibility and authority to provide for the operation of solid waste management facilities to meet the needs of all incorporated or unincorporated areas of the county. Nothing in this chapter, however, prohibits a local government from continuing to operate or to use an existing management facility, permitted on or before this chapter is effective, in accordance with the provisions of the solid waste management plan submitted by the county or region within which the local government is located. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a county which does not regulate the operation or closure of a solid waste management facility, or which has not obtained a permit for that solid waste management facility, shall not be held liable for the operation, closure, and postclosure of that solid waste management facility if it is owned and operated by a private entity under a permit issued by the department. However, that inclusion in a county or regional plan shall not constitute regulation by a county or region under this section. (K) The governing body of a county is authorized to enact such ordinances as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter; provided, however, that the governing body of a county may not enact an ordinance inconsistent with the state solid waste management plan, with any provision of this chapter, with any other applicable provision of state law, or with any regulation promulgated by the department providing for the protection of public health and safety or for protection of the environment. (L) (Reserved) (M) Not later than eighteen months after this chapter is effective, each operator of a municipal solid waste disposal facility shall install scales conforming to requirements established by the department to weigh and record all solid waste when it is received. The department shall promulgate regulations exempting existing facilities which can demonstrate financial hardship and establishing a volume equivalent for such facilities to use in estimating the weight of the solid waste which they receive. All solid waste disposal facilities permitted on or after this chapter is effective shall install scales. (N) Not later than one year after this chapter is effective, there shall be established a local Solid Waste Advisory Council for each county or region intending to submit a solid waste management plan. The local council shall advise the county or region on the preparation of the solid waste management plan and on methods of implementing the plan. The local council shall be provided with all drafts of the plan and shall be given sufficient opportunity to comment on the drafts. Each local council shall consist of not more than fifteen members. The membership of each council shall be as follows: (1) one-third of the membership of the council shall represent the county or member counties of a region and shall be appointed by the governing body or bodies of the county or counties; (2) one-third of the membership of the council shall represent the municipalities within the county or region and shall be appointed by the governing body or bodies of the municipalities within the county or region; and (3) one-third of the membership of the council shall include a representative of the private solid waste management industry and a representative of the private recycling or processing industry, if any, operating within the county or region, and at least two members shall represent the general public and have been active in public participation on environmental issues for the past five or more years. These members shall be appointed by the county and municipal representatives serving on the council. Each local council shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman from among its members. Members shall promulgate regulations concerning meeting attendance. Each council shall, at a minimum, remain in existence until the end of the one hundred eighty-day review period for the plans, but may remain in existence for a longer period of time as determined by its appointing entities. The comments of a local council on the final solid waste management plan shall be forwarded to the department when the final plan is submitted. (O) Any amendments to a county or regional solid waste management plan must be adopted and implemented in the same manner as provided for in the initial plan. (P) This chapter does not: (1) authorize a local government to enter into agreements or to enact ordinances or resolutions determining private rights with respect to recovered materials in solid waste separated for recycling use or reuse at any time prior to pickup by or delivery to a local government or persons under contract with the local government; or (2) prohibit a generator of recovered materials from selling, conveying, or arranging for the transportation of materials to a recycler for recycling nor prevent a recycling company or nonprofit entity from collecting and transporting recovered materials from a buy-back center, drop box, or a generator of recovered materials.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who knowingly disposes of any used oil which has not been properly segregated or separated from other solid wastes by the generator is guilty of a violation of this subsection and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars. This provision may be enforced by a state, county, or municipal law enforcement official, or by the department. (B) No person shall knowingly dispose of used oil filters in a landfill unless the filter has been crushed to the smallest practical volume possible or unless the filter has been hot drained, as established by the department in regulations. (C) The utilization of used oil for road oiling, dust control, weed abatement, or other similar uses which has the potential to cause harm to the environment is prohibited. (D) The department shall encourage the voluntary establishment of used oil collection centers and recycling programs and provide technical assistance to persons who organize such programs. If a hazardous substance is mixed with used oil accepted at a volunteer used oil collection center, any costs for the proper disposal of this contaminated waste will be incurred by the Petroleum Fund, if no more than five gallons of used oil was accepted from any one person at any one time. (E) All government agencies and private businesses that change motor oil for the public and major retail dealers of motor and lubricating oil are encouraged to serve as used oil collection centers. The Department of Transportation shall establish or contract for at least one used oil collection center in every county unless it can certify to the Office of Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling that a private used oil collection center is in operation in a county and is accepting up to five gallons of used oil from any member of the public. A retail dealer of motor oil who maintains a separate tank for a voluntary used oil collection center as approved by the department under this section is eligible for a payment from the South Carolina Department of Revenue from fees collected pursuant to subsection (W) of five cents for every gallon of motor oil that is properly returned on a voluntary basis to a registered used oil transporter or permitted used oil recycling facility upon proper verification. (F) A person who maintains a used oil collection facility that receives a volume of used oil annually, which exceeds a limit to be determined by the department, must register with the department. (G) A used oil collection center must report annually to the department by a date to be determined by the department and must indicate if it is accepting used oil from the public, the quantities of used oil collected in the previous year, and the total quantity of used oil handled in the previous year. (H) No person may recover from the owner or operator of a used oil collection center any costs of response actions resulting from a release of either used oil or a hazardous substance from a used oil collection center if such used oil is: (1) not mixed with any hazardous substance by the owner or operator of the used oil collection center; (2) not knowingly accepted with any hazardous substances contained in it; (3) transported from the used oil collection center by a registered transporter; or (4) stored in a used oil collection center that is in compliance with this section. This subsection applies only to that portion of the used oil collection center utilized for the collection of used oil and does not apply if the owner or operator is grossly negligent in the operation of the public used oil collection center. Nothing in this section shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liability of a person under any other provisions of state or federal law, including common law, for injury or damage resulting from the release of used oil or hazardous substances. For the purpose of this subsection, the owner or operator of a used oil collection center may presume that a quantity of no more than five gallons of used oil accepted from a member of the public is not mixed with a hazardous substance, if the owner or operator acts in good faith and in the belief the oil is generated from the individual's personal activity. (I) Any motor, lubricating, or other oil offered for sale, at retail or at wholesale for direct retail sale, for use off the premises, must be clearly marked or labeled as containing a recyclable material which must be disposed of only at a used oil collection center. A statement on a container of lubricating or other oil offered for sale is in compliance with this section if it contains the following statement: \"Don't pollute. Conserve resources. Return used oil to collection centers.\" (J) Motor oil retailers shall post and maintain, at or near the point of sale, a durable and legible sign, not less than eleven inches by fifteen inches in size, informing the public of the importance of the proper collection and disposal of used oil and how and where used oil may be properly disposed. (K) The department may inspect any place, building, or premises subject to subsections (I) and (J) and issue warnings and citations to a person who fails to comply with the requirements of those subsections. Failure to comply following a warning shall constitute a violation punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars per day. Each day on which an establishment fails to comply shall constitute a separate violation. The proceeds of a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection must be remitted to the Solid Waste Management Trust Fund. (L) The following persons shall register annually with the department pursuant to department regulations on forms prescribed in such regulations: (1) a person who transports over public highways more than five hundred gallons of used oil weekly; (2) a person who maintains a collection facility that receives more than six thousand gallons of used oil annually; and (3) a facility that recycles more than six hundred gallons of used oil annually. (M) The department shall require each registered person to submit by a date to be determined by the department an annual report which specifies the type and quantity of used oil transported, collected, and recycled during the preceding year. The department also shall require each registered person who transports or recycles used oil to maintain records which identify the: (1) source of the materials transported or recycled; (2) quantity of materials received; (3) date of receipt; and (4) destination or the end use of the materials. (N) The department shall require sample analyses of used oil at facilities of representative used oil transporters and at representative recycling facilities to determine the incidence of contamination of used oil with hazardous, toxic, or other harmful substances. (O) The following entities are exempted from the requirements of subsection (L): (1) an on-site burner which only burns a specification used oil generated by the burner, if the burning is done in compliance with any air permits issued by the department; or (2) an electric utility which generates during its operation used oil that is then reclaimed, recycled, or refined by the electric utility for use in its operations. (P) A person who fails to register with the department as required by subsection (L), or to file the annual report required by subsection (M), is subject to a fine not to exceed three hundred dollars per day. Each day on which the person fails to comply shall constitute a separate violation. The proceeds of a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection must be remitted to the Solid Waste Management Trust Fund. (Q) After the effective date of regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to this section, a person who transports over public highways more than five hundred gallons of used oil weekly must be a registered transporter. (R) The department shall promulgate regulations establishing a registration program for transporters of used oil and shall issue, deny, or revoke registrations authorizing the holder to transport used oil. Registration requirements must ensure that a used oil transporter is familiar with applicable regulations and used oil management procedures. The department shall promulgate regulations governing registration which must include requirements for the following: (1) registration and annual reporting; (2) evidence of familiarity with laws and regulations governing used oil transportation; and (3) proof of liability insurance or other means of financial responsibility for any liability which may be incurred in the transport of used oil. (S) Each person who intends to operate, modify, or close a used oil recycling facility shall obtain an operation or closure permit from the department before operating, modifying, or closing the facility. (T) Not later than eighteen months after this chapter is effective, the department shall develop a permitting system for used oil recycling facilities. (U) Permits must not be required under subsection (S) for the burning of used oil as a fuel, provided: (1) a valid air permit, if required, issued by the department is in effect for the facility; (2) the facility burns used oil in accordance with applicable state and local government regulations, and the requirements and conditions of its air permit; and (3) the on specification used oil is burned in industrial furnaces and boilers and nonindustrial furnaces and boilers. (V) No permit is required under this section for the use of used oil for the benefaction or flotation of phosphate rock. (W)(1) For sales made after October 31, 1991, a person making wholesale sales of motor oil or similar lubricants, and a person importing into this State ex-tax motor oil or similar lubricants, shall pay a fee on a monthly basis of eight cents for each gallon of motor oil or similar lubricants sold at wholesale or ex-tax motor oil or similar lubricants imported. As used in this provision, \"ex-tax motor oil or similar lubricants\" means motor oil or similar lubricants upon which the fee imposed has not been levied and which is not sold at wholesale in this State. The fee imposed must be imposed only once with respect to each gallon of motor oil or similar lubricants. The South Carolina State Department of Revenue shall administer, collect, and enforce this fee in the same manner the sales and use taxes are collected pursuant to Chapter 36 of Title 12. However, taxpayers are not required to make payments pursuant to Section 12-36-2600. Instead of the discount allowed pursuant to Section 12-36-2610, the taxpayer may retain three percent of the total fees collected as an administrative collection allowance. This allowance applies whether or not the return is timely filed. A motor carrier which purchases lubricating oils not for resale used in its fleet is exempt from the fee. The motor carrier must: (a) have a maintenance facility to service its own fleet and properly store waste oil for recycling collections; (b) have on file with the Environmental Protection Agency the existence of storage tanks for waste oil storage; (c) maintain records of the dispensing and servicing of lubrication oil in the fleet vehicles; and (d) have a written contractual agreement with an approved waste oil hauler. (2) The Department of Revenue shall remit fees collected pursuant to this section to the Solid Waste Management Trust Fund, less payments made pursuant to subsection (E). The fees must be reserved in a separate account designated as the Petroleum Fund. The Petroleum Fund must be under the administration of the Office of Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling. The funds generated by the fees authorized by this section and set aside for the Petroleum Fund must be used by the Office of Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling as follows: (a) Two-fifths of the funds must be used to establish incentive programs to encourage: (1) individuals who change their own oil to return their used oil to used oil collection centers; (2) the establishment and continued operation of collection centers which accept used oil, including a one-time rebate to retailers who maintain department approved used oil collection centers for equipment used in the used oil collection process, not to exceed five hundred dollars a location. The used oil collection center must maintain a separate tank for the collection of voluntarily returned used oil to be eligible for this rebate. This rebate must be distributed by the department upon approval of the collection center by the department and submittal of proof of purchase of the equipment. (3) the establishment and continued operation of recycling facilities which prepare used oil for reuses or which utilize used oil in a manner that substitutes for a petroleum product made from new oil. (b) Two-fifths of the funds must be used to provide grants for local government projects that the office determines will encourage the collection, reuse, and proper disposal of used oil and similar lubricants. Local government projects may include one or more of the following programs or activities: (1) curbside pickup of used oil containers by a local government or its designee; (2) retrofitting of solid waste equipment to promote curbside pickup or disposal of used oil at used oil collection centers designated by the local government; (3) establishment of publicly operated used oil collection centers at landfills or other public places; or (4) providing of containers and other materials and supplies that the public can utilize in an environmentally sound manner to store used oil for pickup or return to a used oil collection center. (c) One-fifth of the funds must be used for public education and research including, but not limited to, reuses, disposal, and development of markets for used oil and similar lubricants. The office may use funds set aside under subitem (a) of item (2) to contract for the development and implementation of incentive programs, and the office may use funds set aside under subitem (c) of item (2) to contract for the development and implementation of research and education programs. After the fee is imposed upon a distributor, the fee may not be imposed again upon a person who subsequently receives motor oil or similar lubricants from a distributor upon whom the fee already has been imposed. Motor oil or similar lubricants exported from this State in its original package or container must be exempt from the fee imposed in this section. A person purchasing motor oil or similar lubricants at wholesale in its original package or container and who exports such motor oil or similar lubricants from this State may certify in writing to the seller that the motor oil or similar lubricants will be exported, and such certification, if taken by the seller in good faith, will relieve the seller of the fee otherwise imposed.

      "text": "(A) Not later than ninety days after this chapter is effective, the owner or operator of a waste tire site shall notify the department of the site's location and size and the approximate number of waste tires that are accumulated at the site. However, this section does not apply to a manufacturer who disposes only of tires generated in the course of its scientific research and development activities, so long as the waste tires are buried on the facility's own land or that of its affiliates or subsidiaries and the disposal facility is in compliance with all applicable regulations. (B) Not later than six months after this chapter is effective, the department shall submit to the Governor and to the General Assembly a report on waste tire management and disposal in this State. The report shall, at a minimum, include the following: (1) the number of waste tires generated in this State and the geographical distribution of the waste tires; (2) the number and location of existing waste tire sites; (3) the location of existing waste tire collection sites; (4) the necessary financial responsibility requirements for sites, haulers, processors, collectors, and disposers of waste tires; (5) alternative methods of collecting waste tires; (6) current and future options for waste tire recycling; (7) methods to establish reliable sources of waste tires for waste tire users; and (8) types and location of facilities in this State that can utilize waste tires as a fuel source. (C) State and county solid waste management plans shall include a section on waste tires. The section on waste tires shall provide for public participation in its preparation and shall, as a minimum, include: (1) an estimate of the number of waste tires currently generated annually within that county or region and a projection of the number of waste tires to be generated during the twenty-year period following the date this chapter is effective; (2) an estimate of the current capacity in the county to manage waste tire disposal; (3) an estimate of the annual cost of implementing the approved waste tire disposal plan; (4) an estimate of the cost of siting, construction, and bringing into operation any new facilities needed to provide waste tire disposal; (5) the number of waste tires generated in each county and the geographical distribution of such waste tires; (6) the number and location of existing waste tire sites; (7) the location of existing waste tire collection sites; (8) alternative methods of collecting waste tires; (9) current and future options for waste tire recycling; (10) methods to establish reliable sources of waste tires for waste tire users; and (11) types and location of facilities in this county that can utilize waste tires as a fuel source. (D) Each county is required by the department to participate in ongoing waste tire clean-up enforcement efforts, and no later than twelve months after promulgation of regulations by the department, establish approved waste tire accumulation sites, designate waste tire processing, recycling, and disposal methods to be used, and begin disposal operations in compliance with the applicable regulations. Counties may contract with other counties and with private firms to implement the provisions of this chapter. The department shall administer waste tire management plans for those counties which do not submit proposals. (E) Counties are prohibited from imposing an additional fee on waste tires generated within the county. However, a county may impose an additional fee on waste tires, heavy equipment tires, and oversized tires that have a greater diameter than the largest tire with a Department of Transportation number. A fee may be charged on waste tires generated outside of South Carolina. Counties may require fleets to provide documentation for proof of purchase on in-state tires. For tires not included in documentation, an additional tipping fee may be charged. Counties may charge a tipping fee of up to one dollar and fifty cents for each tire or up to one hundred fifty dollars a ton for waste tires generated in this State for which no fee has been paid otherwise. (F) Counties may charge a tipping fee of up to one dollar and fifty cents for each waste tire manufactured in this State or up to one hundred fifty dollars per ton for waste tires manufactured in this State for which no fee has been paid otherwise. (G) Not later than six months after the department promulgates regulations, a person, except as provided, shall not knowingly deposit whole waste tires in a landfill as a method of ultimate disposal. (H) Eighteen months after this chapter is effective, a person shall not: (1) maintain a waste tire collection site unless such site is an integral part of the person's permitted waste tire treatment facility or that person has entered into a contract with a permitted waste tire treatment facility for the disposal of waste tires; (2) knowingly dispose of waste tires in this State, unless the waste tires are disposed of at a permitted solid waste disposal facility; or (3) knowingly dispose of or discard waste tires on the property of another in a manner not prescribed by this chapter. For an interim period to be determined by the department, waste tires may be disposed of at a solid waste disposal facility, a waste tire recycling or processing facility, or a waste tire collection center seeking a permit from the department pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person violating this subsection shall be subject to a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars. This provision may be enforced by a state, county, or municipal law enforcement official, or by the department. Each tire improperly disposed of must constitute a separate violation. (I) It is the policy of this State to recommend that waste tires be managed at a: (a) waste tire collection site which is an integral part of a permitted waste tire recycling or processing facility; (b) permitted waste tire recycling or processing facility; or (c) permitted waste tire collection center. (J)(1) Not later than twelve months after this chapter is effective, the department shall promulgate regulations requiring all collectors, processors, recyclers, haulers, and disposers of waste tires to obtain a permit or registration issued by the department. (2) The regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection must set forth the requirements for the issuance, denial, suspension, and revocation of such permits or registrations. (3) After the effective date of the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection, a person shall not collect, haul, recycle, or process waste tires unless that person has obtained a permit or registration from the department for that activity or, for an interim period to be determined by the department, is seeking a permit or registration from the department for that activity. (4) To carry out the purposes and provisions of this section, the department is authorized to: (a) promulgate such regulations, procedures, or standards as are necessary to protect human health and safety of the environment from the adverse effects of improper, inadequate, or unsound management of waste tires; (b) issue, deny, suspend, revoke, or modify permits, registrations, or orders under such conditions as the department may prescribe, pursuant to procedures consistent with the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, for the management of waste tires; and (c) conduct inspections and investigations, obtain records of waste tire processing, storage, or hauling activities, obtain samples, and conduct research regarding the operation and maintenance of any waste tire management facility. (5)(a) The department shall suspend a waste tire processing facility from accepting waste tires when the department determines that the permitted capacity at the facility is exceeded, and after the facility has been provided an opportunity to return to compliance. (b) Once the department determines that the permitted capacity at the facility is exceeded, the department shall provide a written warning notice to the facility that the permitted capacity has been exceeded and provide seven calendar days to reduce the number of tires at the facility to the permitted limit. (c) If after seven calendar days the facility has not reduced the number of tires at the facility to the permitted limit, the department will provide written notice to the facility requiring it to cease accepting tires and to reduce the quantity of waste tires and processed tires on-site to no more than eighty percent of the permitted capacity within twenty-one calendar days of receipt of the notice. (d) If after the twenty-one-day period the facility fails to comply with the requirements of the written notice as verified by the department, the department shall suspend the facility's permit via written notice to the facility and shall remove the permitted facility from the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List pursuant to subsection (O). (e) The suspension shall remain in effect until the facility has reduced the quantity of waste tires and processed tires on-site to no more than eighty percent of its permitted capacity, as determined by the facility, and verified by the department. (f) The department shall lift the permit suspension and return the facility to the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List pursuant to the following: (i) upon verification by the department that the facility has reduced the total quantity of waste tires and processed tires on-site to no more than eighty percent of its permitted capacity; and (ii) if, upon referenced verification, the facility does not have any additional citations for material violations that remain unresolved. (g) The permitted facility shall not receive additional waste tires at the facility until the facility has received written notification from the department that the permit suspension has been lifted. However, during the permit suspension, the permitted facility may continue to process tires and sell product. (h) Each waste tire accepted by the facility during a suspension period shall be deemed a separate violation and may be deemed a wilful violation subject to the provisions of Section 44-96-100(B). (K) Subsection (J) does not apply to items (1) through (5) if these designated waste tire sites are maintained so as to prevent and control mosquitoes or other public health nuisances as determined by the department: (1) a tire retailing business where less than one thousand waste tires are kept on the business premises; (2) a tire retreading business where less than two thousand five hundred waste tires are kept on the business premises or a tire retreading facility that is owned or operated by a company that manufactures tires in this State or the tire manufacturer's parent company or its subsidiaries; (3) a business that, in the ordinary course of business, removes tires from motor vehicles if less than one thousand of these tires are kept on the business premises; (4) a permitted solid waste facility with less than two thousand five hundred waste tires temporarily stored on the business premises; or (5) a person using waste tires for agricultural purposes. (L) The department shall encourage the voluntary establishment of waste tire collection centers, waste tire treatment facilities, and solid waste disposal facilities to be open to the public for the deposit of waste tires. (M) The department is authorized to establish incentive programs to encourage individuals to return their used tires to waste tire recycling or processing facilities. (N) For sales made on or after November 1, 1991, there is imposed a fee of two dollars for each new tire sold with a Department of Transportation number to the ultimate consumer, whether or not the tire is mounted by the seller. The wholesaler or retailer receiving new tires from unlicensed wholesalers is responsible for paying the fee imposed by this subsection. The Department of Revenue shall administer, collect, and enforce the tire recycling fee in the same manner that the sales and use taxes are collected pursuant to Chapter 36 of Title 12. The fee imposed by this subsection must be remitted on a monthly basis. Instead of the discount allowed pursuant to Section 12-36-2610, the taxpayer may retain three percent of the total fees collected as an administrative collection allowance. This allowance applies whether or not the return is timely filed. The department shall deposit all fees collected to the credit of the State Treasurer who shall establish a separate and distinct account from the state general fund. The State Treasurer shall distribute one and one-half dollars for each tire sold, less applicable credit, refund, and discount, to each county based upon the population in each county according to the most recent United States Census. The county shall use these funds for collection, processing, or recycling of waste tires generated within the State. The remaining portion of the tire recycling fee is to be credited to the Solid Waste Management Trust Fund by the State Treasurer for the Waste Tire Grant Trust Fund, established under the administration of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The General Assembly shall review the waste tire disposal recycling fee every five years. (O)(1) A wholesaler or retailer required to submit a fee pursuant to subsection (N) who delivers or arranges delivery of waste tires to a facility listed on the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List, may apply for a refund of one dollar for each tire delivered. If waste tires generated in this State, on which a fee has been paid, are delivered to a waste tire facility located outside this State, a wholesaler or retailer may apply for a refund of one dollar per tire delivered if the receiving facility is listed on the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List; in no case may a refund be approved for a number of tires delivered in excess of the number of new tires sold by the individual wholesaler or retailer. Verification must be provided as required by the South Carolina State Department of Revenue. All refunds made pursuant to this subsection must be charged against the appropriate county's distributions under subsection (N). (2) The department shall maintain the list of facilities known as the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List. (3) The Waste Tire Rebate Facility List shall include department-permitted waste tire processing facilities that fulfill the requirements of a waste tire recycling facility, as defined in Section 44-96-40(68)(d), and facilities located outside of South Carolina that are permitted or approved by the host state and that also fulfill the requirements of a waste tire recycling facility, as defined in Section 44-96-40(68)(d). (4) The department shall remove from the Waste Tire Rebate Facility List any facility whose permit has been revoked or suspended, until the permit has been reinstated by the department or host state. (P) The Office of Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling of the Department of Health and Environmental Control may provide grants from the Waste Tire Trust Fund to counties which have exhausted all funds remitted to counties under Section 44-96-170(N), to regions applying on behalf of those counties and to local governments within those counties to assist in the following: (1) constructing, operating, or contracting with waste tire processing or recycling facilities; (2) removing or contracting for the removal of waste tires for processing or recycling; (3) performing or contracting for the performance of research designed to facilitate waste tire recycling; or (4) the purchase or use of recycled products or materials made from waste tires generated in this State. (Q) Waste tire grants must be awarded on the basis of written grant request proposals submitted to and approved, not less than annually, by the committee consisting of ten members appointed by the commissioner representing: (1) the South Carolina Tire Dealers and Retreaders Association; (2) the South Carolina Association of Counties; (3) the South Carolina Association of Regional Councils; (4) the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control; (5) tire manufacturers; (6) the general public; (7) a public interest environmental organization; (8) the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources; (9) the Office of the Governor; and (10) the South Carolina Municipal Association. Members of the committee shall serve for terms of three years and until their successors are appointed and qualify. Vacancies must be filled in the manner of original appointment for the unexpired portion of the term. The representative of the department shall serve as chairman. The committee shall review grant requests and proposals and make recommendations on grant awards to the State Solid Waste Advisory Council. Grants must be awarded by the State Solid Waste Advisory Council. (R) Notwithstanding subsection (N), the department may use funds from the Waste Tire Trust Fund to fund activities of the department to implement provisions of this section to promote the recycling of waste tires and to encourage higher end uses of waste tires. The use of these funds must be reviewed annually by the Waste Tire Committee and the Solid Waste Advisory Council. The Recycling Market Development Advisory Council and the Solid Waste Advisory Council also may make recommendations to the office for use of these funds. (S) The department shall establish by regulation recordkeeping and reporting requirements for waste tire haulers and collection, processing, recycling, and disposal facilities. (T) A county failing to comply with the requirements of this section and regulations promulgated under it is not eligible for monies from the Waste Tire Trust Fund.

      "text": "(A) The General Assembly finds that: (1) South Carolina is generating increasingly large volumes of solid waste which may pose a threat to human health and safety and to the environment if not properly managed or if managed in facilities inadequately designed and operated to ensure protection of human health and safety and the environment. (2) Many communities are managing solid waste in existing facilities not designed and operated with technology and engineering controls that are adequately protective of the environment. (3) A number of new solid waste management facilities will have to be established in coming years to replace older facilities as they reach capacity or as they are required to close because they cannot meet new state or federal regulatory requirements. (4) It is the policy of the State of South Carolina to protect human health and safety and the environment from the effects of improper or inadequate solid waste management. (5) Legislation is needed to establish an adequate regulatory framework for the siting, design, construction, operation, and closure of solid waste management facilities in order to provide protection for human health and safety and for the environment. (6) A regional approach to the establishment of solid waste management facilities should be strongly encouraged in order to provide solid waste management services in the most efficient and cost-effective manner and to minimize any threat to human health and safety or to the environment. (B) It is the purpose of this article to: (1) regulate solid waste management facilities other than hazardous waste management facilities subject to the South Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Act, infectious waste management facilities subject to the South Carolina Infectious Waste Management Act, and radioactive waste facilities subject to the South Carolina Atomic Energy and Radiation Control Act and other federal and state laws; and (2) ensure that all solid waste management facilities in this State are sited, designed, constructed, operated, and closed in a manner that protects human health and safety and the environment.

      "text": "(A) No person shall operate a solid waste management facility without a permit from the department. However, pursuant to a county or regional plan, any political subdivision of this State may hold a permit for a solid waste management facility as the owner of the facility and may contract for the operation, management, or both, of the facility. A separate permit shall be required for each site or facility although the department may include one or more different types of facilities in a single permit if the facilities are collocated on the same site. The department may, by regulation, exempt certain facilities from all or part of the requirements of this section. (B) No person shall initiate construction, expansion, modification, or closure of a solid waste management facility except in accordance with requirements established by the department pursuant to this article. (C) Permits issued by the department to existing solid waste management facilities pursuant to statutory and regulatory requirements in effect before the date this article is effective remain valid for the life of the permit. However, a solid waste management facility without an approved closure plan is subject to the closure and postclosure requirements of this article applicable to that type of facility and to any other requirements made applicable specifically to existing solid waste management facilities by this article or by regulations promulgated pursuant to it. Upon expiration of the permit, the permittee shall comply with the requirements of this article and regulations promulgated pursuant to it. (D) The department shall promulgate regulations for the permitting of solid waste management facilities which shall, at a minimum, address the following issues: (1) contents of permit applications and application procedures; (2) suspension, revocation, modification, issuance, denial, or renewal of a permit, including the criteria for taking such action and the procedures for taking such action consistent with the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act; (3) exemptions, variances, and emergency approvals; (4) financial responsibility requirements sufficient to ensure the satisfactory maintenance, closure, and postclosure care of any solid waste management facility or to carry out any corrective action which may be required as a condition of a permit; provided, however, that consideration shall be given to mechanisms which would provide flexibility to the owner or operator in meeting its financial obligations. The owner or operator shall be allowed to use combined financial responsibility mechanisms for a single facility and shall be allowed to use combined financial responsibility mechanisms for multiple facilities, utilizing actuarially sound risk-spreading techniques. The department shall require the demonstration of financial responsibility prior to issuing a permit for any solid waste management facility. The department regulations regarding financial responsibility requirements shall not apply to any local government or region comprised of local governments which owns and operates a municipal solid waste management facility unless and until such time as federal regulations require such local governments and regions to demonstrate financial responsibility for such facilities; (5) public notice and public hearing requirements consistent with the requirements of the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act; and (6) generally applicable operational requirements. (E) No permit to construct a new solid waste management facility or to expand an existing solid waste management facility may be issued until a demonstration of need is approved by the department, as required by regulation. Facilities which lawfully burn nonhazardous waste for energy recovery up to the normal rate of manufacturing production or which lawfully use or reuse the waste to make a product shall not be excluded from the demonstration of need requirement. No construction of new or expanded solid waste management facilities may be commenced until all permits required for construction have been issued. In determining if there is a need for new or expanded solid waste disposal sites, the department shall not consider solid waste generated in jurisdictions not subject to the provisions of a county or regional solid waste management plan pursuant to this chapter. The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. These regulations must apply to all solid waste management facilities which have not obtained all permits required for construction. This subsection does not apply to inert or cellulosic solid waste facilities which are not commercial solid waste management facilities or to industrial facilities managing solid waste generated in the course of normal operations on property under the same ownership or control as the solid waste management facility if the industrial facility is not a commercial solid waste management facility. (F) No permit to construct a new solid waste management facility or to expand an existing solid waste management facility within a county or municipality may be issued by the department unless the proposed facility or expansion is consistent with the local or regional solid waste management plan and the state solid waste management plan; and the host jurisdiction and the jurisdiction generating solid waste destined for the proposed facility or expansion can demonstrate that they are actively involved in and have a strategy for meeting the statewide goal of waste reduction established in this chapter. This subsection must not apply to industrial facilities managing solid waste generated in the course of normal operations on property under the same ownership or control as the waste management facility. However, the facilities shall be consistent with the applicable local zoning and land use ordinances, if any; and provided further, that the industrial facility is not a commercial solid waste management facility. (G) A permit to construct a new solid waste management facility or to expand an existing solid waste management facility as authorized by this chapter may not be issued until the applicant provides documentation from the applicable local government of compliance with local land use and zoning ordinances along with the permit application. (H) A permit issued pursuant to this article shall contain such conditions or requirements as are necessary to comply with the requirements of this article and the regulations of the department and to prevent a substantial hazard to human health or to the environment. Permits issued under this section shall be effective for the design and operational life of the facility, to be determined by the department, subject to the provisions of this article. However, at least once every five years, the department shall review the environmental compliance history of each permittee. The time period for review for each category of permits shall be established by the department by regulation. If, upon review, the department finds that material or substantial violations of the permit demonstrate the permittee's disregard for or inability to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or requirements and would make continuation of the permit not in the best interests of human health and safety or the environment, the department may, after a hearing, amend or revoke the permit, as appropriate and necessary. When a permit is reviewed, the department shall include additional limitations, standards, or conditions when the technical limitations, standards, or regulations on which the original permit was based have been changed by statute or amended by regulation. (I) The department may amend or attach conditions to a permit when: (1) there is a significant change in the manner and scope of operation which may require new or additional permit conditions or safeguards to protect human health and safety and the environment; (2) the investigation has shown the need for additional equipment, construction, procedures, and testing to ensure the protection of human health and safety and the environment; and (3) the amendment is necessary to meet changes in applicable regulatory requirements. (J) The department may issue permits for short-term structural fills pursuant to department regulations. These permits shall require that structural fills be closed and cover put in place within twelve months of issuance of the permit. Consistency with solid waste management plans pursuant to subsection (G) is not required for the issuance of permits for short-term structural fills. For the purpose of this subsection, \"cover\" means soil or other suitable material, or both, acceptable to the department that is used to cover solid waste. For the purpose of this subsection, \"structural fill\" means landfilling for future beneficial use utilizing land-clearing debris, hardened concrete, hardened/cured asphalt, bricks, blocks, and other materials specified by the department by regulation, compacted and landfilled in a manner acceptable to the department, consistent with applicable engineering and construction standards and carried out as a part of normal activities associated with construction, demolition, and land-clearing operations; however, the materials utilized must not have been in direct contact with hazardous constituents, petroleum products, or painted with lead-based paint. Applicable department regulations in effect on the effective date of this act, not inconsistent with this subsection, remain in effect unless changed by statute or amended or repealed by the department pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, Article 1, Chapter 23, Title 1. Text of (K) effective until January 27, 2027. See, Editor's Note. (K) An advanced recycling facility must demonstrate financial responsibility prior to being issued a permit for the advanced recycling facility or prior to the advanced recycling facility being placed in operation. To demonstrate financial responsibility, the advanced recycling facility must establish a cash trust fund under the control of the department or obtain a surety bond for which the department is the sole beneficiary, sufficient in form and amount to meet all reasonably foreseeable costs of clean up, environmental remediation, firefighting, ground water or surface water contamination, private property contamination, public health impacts, and displacement and relocation of affected persons, and any other reasonably foreseeable costs associated with the operation, management, or abandonment of any pyrolysis and gasification facilities including, but not limited to, the operation and storage of post-use polymer, plastic polymer, or incidental contaminants or impurities; provided, however, that no cash trust fund or surety bond shall be required if the advanced recycling facility establishes to the department that such costs are not reasonably foreseeable.
