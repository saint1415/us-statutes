      "text": "As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Board\" shall mean the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control.\n\n(2) \"Branch office\" shall mean a location or site from which a home health agency provides services within a portion of the total geographic area served by the parent agency. The branch office is part of the home health agency and is located sufficiently close to share administration, supervision, and services in a manner that renders it unnecessary for the branch independently to meet the conditions of participation as a home health agency.\n\n(3) \"Department\" shall mean South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\n(4) \"Home health agency\" shall mean public, nonprofit, or proprietary organization, whether owned or operated by one or more persons or legal entities, which furnishes or offers to furnish home health services.\n\n(5) \"Home health services\" shall mean those items and services furnished to an individual by a home health agency, or by others under arrangement with the home health agency, on a visiting basis, and except for subsection \"e\" below, in a place of temporary or permanent residence used as the individual's home as follows:\n\n(a) Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care as ordered by a physician, an APRN pursuant to Section 40-33-34(D)(2)(h), or a PA pursuant to Section 40-47-935(B)(8) and as provided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse and at least one other service listed below;\n\n(b) Physical, occupational or speech therapy;\n\n(c) Medical social services, home health aide services and other therapeutic services;\n\n(d) Medical supplies and the use of medical appliances;\n\n(e) Any of the foregoing items and services which are provided on an outpatient basis under arrangements made by the home health agency with a hospital, nursing care facility, or rehabilitation center and the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items and services cannot be readily made available to the individual in his home, or which are furnished at such facility while the patient is there to receive such items or service, but not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such items or services.\n\n(6) \"License\" shall mean a license issued by the Department.\n\n(7) \"Licensee\" shall mean the individual, corporation, or public entity with whom rests the ultimate responsibility for maintaining approved standards for the home health agency.\n\n(8) \"Parent Home Health Agency\" shall mean the agency that develops and maintains administrative controls of subunits or branch offices.\n\n(9) \"Physician\" shall mean an individual currently licensed to practice medicine, surgery, or osteopathy in this State.\n\n(10) \"Registered Nurse\" shall mean an individual who is currently licensed as such in this State.\n\n(11) \"Subunit\" shall mean a semiautonomous organization, which serves patients in a geographic area different from that of the parent agency. The subunit by virtue of the distance between it and the parent agency is judged incapable of sharing administration, supervision, and services on a daily basis with the parent agency and must, therefore, independently meet the conditions of participation for home health agencies.\n\nHISTORY: 1978 Act No. 548 Section 2; 2021 Act No. 55 (S.503), Section 3, eff July 16, 2021.",

This license is effective for a twelve-month period following the date of issue. A license issued under this chapter is not assignable or transferable and is subject to suspension or revocation at any time for failure to comply with this act. Subunits of parent home health agencies must be separately licensed.\n\nThe department may enter into public and private joint partnerships or enter into other appropriate cooperative agreements or arrangements or negotiate and effect these partnerships and agreements to include the sale of the entity and/or the transfer of licenses held by the department or its subdivisions to other qualified providers, if appropriate, when doing so would result in continued high quality patient care, continued provision of services to indigent patients, assurance of the employment of the department's home health employees, and provision of home care services adequate to meet the needs of the State. The department may facilitate the negotiation, contracting, or transfer of these activities through licensure and without requirement of a Certificate of Need as set out in Section 44-69-75 and without regard to the Procurement Code, Section 11-35-10, et. seq. However, a sale of the entity is subject to the provisions of the Procurement Code.\n\nAt least thirty days before entering any negotiations regarding a contractual agreement or a public/private partnership concerning the provision of home health services, the department shall place a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation for a period of no less than three consecutive days within the area where the services will be performed.\n\nThe department may establish requirements and conditions upon those entities joined in partnership or receiving transfer of the home care services, licensing, and Certificate of Need including, but not limited to, transfer of employees, coverage of indigent patients, and payments or contributions to the department to continue the provision of basic public health services as determined by the department. All agreements must be reviewed and approved by the board of the department. The department may monitor and enforce the contract or partnership provisions and/or conditions of transfer or any other conditions or requirements of agreements entered into pursuant to this section.\n\nAll funds paid to or received by the department pursuant to this section must be deposited in an account separate and distinct from the general fund entitled the Public Health Fund (PHF). The funds deposited in this fund must be used solely by the department to support basic public health services determined to be necessary by the department. The appropriation of the funds must be through the General Appropriations Act.\n\nNotwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, the department may continue to provide public health services in the clinic, the home, and the community necessary to ensure the protection and promotion of the public's health.\n\nHISTORY: 1978 Act No. 548 Section 3; 1983 Act No. 6 Section 1; 1995 Act No. 145, Part II, Section 116.",
