In that respect, the provisions of this chapter are cumulative.\n\n(C) The execution of a POST form is always voluntary and is for a person with an advanced illness. The POST form records a patient's wishes for medical treatment in the patient's current state of health. Preferred medical treatment as stated by the patient on the POST form may be changed at any time by the patient or a designated health care representative or health care agent of the patient to reflect the patient's new wishes. While no form can anticipate and address all medical treatment decisions that may need to be made, an advance health care directive applies regardless of health status. An advance directive allows a patient to document in detail future health care instructions and to name a health care agent to speak on the patient's behalf if the patient is unable to communicate to ensure that the patient's advance directive wishes as to life-sustaining medical treatment are fulfilled.\n\nHISTORY: 2019 Act No. 89 (H.4004), Section 2, eff May 24, 2019.",
