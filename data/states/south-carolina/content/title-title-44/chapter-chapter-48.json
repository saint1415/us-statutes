      "text": "The General Assembly finds that a mentally abnormal and extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exists who require involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment. The General Assembly further finds that the likelihood these sexually violent predators will engage in repeated acts of sexual violence if not treated for their mental conditions is significant. Because the existing civil commitment process is inadequate to address the special needs of sexually violent predators and the risks that they present to society, the General Assembly has determined that a separate, involuntary civil commitment process for the long-term control, care, and treatment of sexually violent predators is necessary. The General Assembly also determines that, because of the nature of the mental conditions from which sexually violent predators suffer and the dangers they present, it is necessary to house involuntarily-committed sexually violent predators in secure facilities separate from persons involuntarily committed under traditional civil commitment statutes. The civil commitment of sexually violent predators is not intended to stigmatize the mentally ill community.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 321, Section 1; 2004 Act No. 176, Section 1, eff February 18, 2004.",

The resident also has the right to have a qualified evaluator evaluate the resident on the resident's behalf, and the court must appoint a qualified evaluator if the resident is indigent and requests the appointment. The burden of proof at the trial is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the resident's mental abnormality or personality disorder remains such that the resident is not safe to be at large and, if released, is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 321, Section 1; 2004 Act No. 176, Section 1, eff February 18, 2004; 2023 Act No. 19 (S.146), Section 8, eff May 16, 2023.",

The resident shall have the burden of proof to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in accordance with the applicable law.\n\n(B) Petitions shall be filed in the original jurisdiction of the South Carolina Supreme Court under the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules within one hundred eighty days of the date that any appeals from the commitment or periodic review proceedings are final. Upon the receipt of the petition, the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court shall issue an order designating a circuit court or appellate court judge as a referee to make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall report the findings and conclusions to the Supreme Court. The designated judge shall have the statewide authority to issue orders as necessary.\n\n(C) Except as provided in this chapter, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and the South Carolina Rules of Evidence apply to cases filed pursuant to this section, in evidentiary hearings before the designated hearing judge.\n\n(D) The named respondent shall be the Department of Mental Health. A copy of the petition shall be served on the Department of Mental Health and the South Carolina Attorney General's Office.\n\n(E) Upon the filing of a petition alleging that the resident is indigent and desires appointed counsel, the designated judge shall appoint an attorney to represent the resident. Counsel shall be appointed from the contract attorney list of post-conviction counsel maintained by the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, or such other list of attorneys as the Executive Director of the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense shall designate. If no attorney is available from this list, then the designated circuit court judge shall appoint an attorney from the Appointment of Lawyers for Indigents. The designated judge shall not appoint an attorney who previously represented the resident in any prior criminal proceedings underlying the commitment or state post-conviction relief proceedings or appeals from those proceedings, in the original sexually violent predator civil commitment proceeding or appeal from that proceeding, or in any previous or present periodic reviews or appeals therefrom.\n\n(F) The designated judge shall authorize by court order to the particular county clerks of court the disclosure of any pleadings, evidence, transcripts, or other documents filed in any circuit court or appellate court clerk's office of this State in any case in which the resident was a defendant, respondent, or party to a criminal action or an action under the Sexually Violent Predator Act that was ordered sealed. These materials shall be unsealed for the limited purpose of providing items to the appointed counsel for the resident or the resident himself, if he elects to proceed pro se, and to the Department of Mental Health and its attorneys.\n\n(G) Regardless of whether the resident indicates that he has served the Department of Mental Health, the Clerk of Court of the South Carolina Supreme Court shall forward the filed petition and all accompanying papers to the Department of Mental Health's Office of General Counsel, as the agent for the service of process for the Department of Mental Health, and a copy to the Attorney General's Office. The Department of Mental Health, through the Attorney General's Office acting as its representative, shall file its responsive pleading within thirty days of the receipt of the order appointing counsel, or within thirty days of the receipt of the petition, if counsel is retained, or the receipt of the petition, if the resident is proceeding pro se without a request for counsel at the time of the filing.\n\n(H) In the event that a habeas petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel claims relating to the resident's commitment or periodic review is filed before the conclusion of the resident's appeal from such proceeding, the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall dismiss the petition without prejudice and without requiring a response from the Department of Mental Health.\n\n(I) Within thirty days of an assignment, the designated judge shall issue a scheduling order, including a discovery schedule, and shall set a hearing within not more than one hundred eighty days from the filing of the petition. A final report to the Supreme Court shall be submitted within thirty days from the conclusion of the hearing, including findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the designated judge's recommendation. This does not preclude the designated judge from recommending to the Supreme Court that the petition be denied on the basis of the pleadings without a hearing. The recommendation shall set forth the basis for dismissal.\n\n(J) Upon receipt by the Supreme Court of the findings and conclusions of the designated judge, the Clerk of the Supreme Court may set forth an appropriate briefing schedule. The clerk may consider expediting the matter to determine whether the writ of habeas corpus should be granted and the appropriate relief. The court may also issue, as appropriate, orders relating to whether intervening and on-going statutory status review proceedings or appeals from the proceedings are affected in any manner by the habeas corpus actions in its original jurisdiction.\n\nHISTORY: 2023 Act No. 19 (S.146), Section 9, eff May 16, 2023.",

Upon receipt of the certification and authorization, the resident or the Attorney General may file a petition for release, which must be served upon the court and the Attorney General, or on opposing counsel if filed by the Attorney General. The Attorney General must notify the victim of the proceeding.\n\n(B) The court, upon receipt of the petition for release filed pursuant to subsection (A), must order a hearing within thirty days unless the Attorney General, with notice to the resident, requests an evaluation by a qualified evaluator as to whether the resident's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the resident is safe to be at large and, if released, is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence, or the resident or the Attorney General requests a trial before a jury. The Attorney General must represent the State and has the right to have the resident examined by a qualified evaluator chosen by the State. If the Attorney General retains a qualified expert who concludes that the petitioner's mental abnormality or personality disorder remains such that the petitioner is not safe to be at large and, if released, is likely to commit acts of sexual violence, the petitioner may retain a qualified expert of his own choosing to perform a subsequent examination. In the case of an indigent petitioner who would request an independent qualified evaluator, the indigent petitioner must file and serve upon the Attorney General and the Commission on Indigent Defense a motion requesting payment and costs for the evaluator. If the court determines that the services are necessary and the requested compensation is reasonable, then the court must authorize, in written order prior to any fees or expenses being incurred, the petitioner's attorney to obtain the services of an independent qualified evaluator to perform an evaluation or participate in the trial on the petitioner's behalf and authorize the payment from funds available to the Commission on Indigent Defense. All qualified evaluators are permitted to have reasonable access to the resident for the purpose of the examination, as well as reasonable access to all relevant medical, psychological, criminal offense, and disciplinary records and reports, and the court shall order the resident to comply with any reasonable testing and assessments deemed necessary by a qualified evaluator. The burden of proof is upon the Attorney General to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the resident's mental abnormality or personality disorder remains such that the resident is not safe to be at large and, that if released, is likely to commit acts of sexual violence.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 321, Section 1; 2004 Act No. 176, Section 1, eff February 18, 2004; 2010 Act No. 158, Section 5, eff May 12, 2010; 2023 Act No. 19 (S.146), Section 10, eff May 16, 2023.",
