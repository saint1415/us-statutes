The copy of the original birth certificate must be in a form that clearly indicates it is not a certified copy and that it may not be used for legal purposes. All procedures, fees, and waiting periods applicable to nonadopted citizens born in the State of South Carolina seeking copies of certificates of birth apply.\n\n(iv) Whenever an adoptee who has reached the age of eighteen applies for a copy of his original birth certificate and accompanying evidence of adoption, the department shall redact from the copy all information as to any biological parent that has not given consent in accordance with this section, unless certified as deceased.\n\n(c) The department shall develop a contact preference form and a medical history form to provide to a biological parent upon request to be completed at his option. Upon completion, a contact preference form and a medical history form must be filed with the state registrar and accompany an original sealed birth certificate issued to an adoptee pursuant to subitem (b).\n\n(d) The contact preference form must allow the biological parent to indicate whether he has completed or updated a medical history form and must allow the biological parent to choose one of the following contact options and provide contact information as appropriate:\n\n(1) I would like to be contacted.\n\n(2) I would prefer to be contacted only through an intermediary.\n\n(3) I prefer not to be contacted at this time. If I decide later that I would like to be contacted, I will submit an updated contact preference form to the state registrar.\n\nOnly department staff authorized to process applications made pursuant to subitem (b) may process contact preference and medical history forms.\n\n(e) The medical history form and contact preference form are confidential communications from the biological parent to the person named on the sealed birth certificate and must be placed in a sealed file upon receipt from the biological parent in the file containing the sealed original birth certificate. The sealed file containing the contact preference form and medical history form must be released to an adoptee requesting the adoptee's own original birth certificate pursuant to subitem (b). The contact preference form and medical history form are private communications from the biological parent to the adoptee named on the sealed birth certificate, and the state registrar shall retain a copy of the forms upon release to the adoptee.\n\n(2) When adoption is decreed by a family court in this State of a person born in a foreign country who was not a United States citizen at birth and evidence of the date and place of birth submitted to the court and the court order setting forth the date and place of birth are attached to the Certificate of Adoption, the state registrar, when directed by the court order, shall prepare a \"Certificate of Foreign Birth\". The certificate, and any issued copy of the certificate, must be labeled \"Certificate of Foreign Birth\" and must show the actual country of birth. A statement also must be included on the certificate, and any issued copy of the certificate, that it is not evidence of United States citizenship for the person for whom it is issued.\n\n(3) If the person was born in a foreign country and was a United States citizen at the time of birth, the state registrar may not prepare a \"Certificate of Foreign Birth\" but shall notify the adoptive parents of the procedure for obtaining a revised birth certificate for their child through the United States Department of State.\n\n(4) For a person born in another state in the United States, the state registrar shall transmit the certified Certificate of Adoption to the state registrar in the state of birth.\n\n(5) When adoption is decreed in a foreign country of a person born in that country and the procedures set forth in Section 63-9-910 are followed, upon receipt of the court order with its findings and the certificate of adoption, the state registrar shall prepare a \"Certificate of Foreign Birth\". The certificate, and any issued copy of the certificate, must be labeled \"Certificate of Foreign Birth\" and must state the actual country of birth. A statement also must be included on the certificate, and any issued copy of the certificate, that it is not evidence of United States' citizenship for the person for whom it is issued.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 32-1129; 1952 Code Section 32-1129; 1945 (44) 3; 1956 (49) 1735; 1987 Act No. 87 Section 2; 1988 Act No. 341, Section 1; 1997 Act No. 69, Section 2; 2018 Act No. 241 (H.3775), Section 1, eff July 1, 2019; 2022 Act No. 200 (H.5000), Section 1, eff May 16, 2023.",
