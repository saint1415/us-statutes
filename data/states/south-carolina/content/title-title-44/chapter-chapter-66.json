      "text": "As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Health care\" means a procedure to diagnose or treat a human disease, ailment, defect, abnormality, or complaint, whether of physical or mental origin. Health care also includes the provision of intermediate or skilled nursing care; services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; and the placement in or removal from a facility that provides these forms of care.\n\n(2) \"Health care provider\" or \"provider\" means a person, health care facility, organization, or corporation licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by the laws of this State to administer health care.\n\n(3) \"Health care professional\" means an individual who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the laws of this State to provide health care to members of the public.\n\n(4) \"Patient\" means an individual sixteen years of age or older who presents or is presented to a health care provider for treatment.\n\n(5) \"Person\" includes, but is not limited to, an individual, a state agency, or a representative of a state agency.\n\n(6) \"Physician\" means an individual who is licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy pursuant to Chapter 47, Title 40.\n\n(7) \"Treatment\" means the broad range of emergency, outpatient, intermediate, and inpatient services and care that may be extended to a patient to diagnose and treat a human disease, ailment, defect, abnormality, or complaint, whether of physical or mental origin. Treatment includes, but is not limited to, psychiatric, psychological, substance abuse, and counseling services.\n\n(8) \"Unable to consent\" means unable to appreciate the nature and implications of the patient's condition and proposed health care, to make a reasoned decision concerning the proposed health care, or to communicate that decision in an unambiguous manner. This term does not apply to minors, and this chapter does not affect the delivery of health care to minors unless they are married or have been determined judicially to be emancipated. A patient's inability to consent must be certified by two licensed physicians, each of whom has examined the patient. However, in an emergency the patient's inability to consent may be certified by a health care professional responsible for the care of the patient if the health care professional states in writing in the patient's record that the delay occasioned by obtaining certification from two licensed physicians would be detrimental to the patient's health. A certifying physician or other health care professional shall give an opinion regarding the cause and nature of the inability to consent, its extent, and its probable duration. If a patient unable to consent is being admitted to hospice care pursuant to a physician certification of a terminal illness required by Medicare, that certification meets the certification requirements of this item.\n\nHISTORY: 1990 Act No. 472, Section 1; 1992 Act No. 306, Section 3; 2002 Act No. 351, Sections 2, eff July 20, 2002; 2013 Act No. 39, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",

      "text": "(A) Where a patient is unable to consent, decisions concerning his health care may be made by the following persons in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) a guardian appointed by the court pursuant to Article 5, Part 3 of the South Carolina Probate Code, if the decision is within the scope of the guardianship;\n\n(2) an attorney-in-fact appointed by the patient in a durable power of attorney executed pursuant to Section 62-5-501, if the decision is within the scope of his authority;\n\n(3) a spouse of the patient unless the spouse and the patient are separated pursuant to one of the following:\n\n(a) entry of a pendente lite order in a divorce or separate maintenance action;\n\n(b) formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement; or\n\n(c) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties;\n\n(4) an adult child of the patient, or if the patient has more than one adult child, a majority of the adult children who are reasonably available for consultation;\n\n(5) a parent of the patient;\n\n(6) an adult sibling of the patient, or if the patient has more than one adult sibling, a majority of the adult siblings who are reasonably available for consultation;\n\n(7) a grandparent of the patient, or if the patient has more than one grandparent, a majority of the grandparents who are reasonably available for consultation;\n\n(8) any other adult relative by blood or marriage who reasonably is believed by the health care professional to have a close personal relationship with the patient, or if the patient has more than one other adult relative, a majority of those other adult relatives who are reasonably available for consultation;\n\n(9) a person given authority to make health care decisions for the patient by another statutory provision;\n\n(10) if, after good faith efforts, the hospital or other health care facility determines that the persons listed in items (1) through (9) are unavailable to consent on behalf of the patient, a person who has an established relationship with the patient, who is acting in good faith on behalf of the patient, and who can reliably convey the patient's wishes but who is not a paid caregiver or a provider of health care services to the patient. For the purposes of this item, a person with an established relationship is an adult who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, who is generally familiar with the patient's health care views and desires, and who is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care decisions and to act in the patient's best interest. The person with an established relationship shall sign and date a notarized acknowledgement form, provided by the hospital or other health care facility in which the patient is located, for placement in the patient's records, setting forth the nature and length of the relationship and certifying that he meets such criteria. Along with the notarized acknowledgment form, the hospital or other health care facility shall include in the patient's medical record documentation of its effort to locate persons with higher priority under this statute as required by subsection (B).\n\n(B) Documentation of efforts to locate a decision maker who is a person identified in subsection (A) must be recorded in the patient's medical record.\n\n(C) If persons of equal priority disagree on whether certain health care should be provided to a patient who is unable to consent, an authorized person, a health care provider involved in the care of the patient, or any other person interested in the welfare of the patient may petition the probate court for an order determining what care is to be provided or for appointment of a temporary or permanent guardian.\n\n(D) Priority pursuant to this section must not be given to a person if a health care provider responsible for the care of a patient who is unable to consent determines that the person is not reasonably available, is not willing to make health care decisions for the patient, or is unable to consent as defined in Section 44-66-20(8).\n\n(E) An attending physician or other health care professional responsible for the care of a patient who is unable to consent may not give priority or authority pursuant to subsections (A)(5) through (A)(10) to a person if the attending physician or health care professional has actual knowledge that, before becoming unable to consent, the patient did not want that person involved in decisions concerning his care.\n\n(F) This section does not authorize a person to make health care decisions on behalf of a patient who is unable to consent if, in the opinion of the certifying physicians, the patient's inability to consent is temporary, and the attending physician or other health care professional responsible for the care of the patient determines that the delay occasioned by postponing treatment until the patient regains the ability to consent will not result in significant detriment to the patient's health.\n\n(G) A person authorized to make health care decisions pursuant to subsection (A) shall base those decisions on the patient's wishes to the extent that the patient's wishes can be determined. Where the patient's wishes cannot be determined, the person shall base the decision on the patient's best interest.\n\n(H) A person authorized to make health care decisions pursuant to subsection (A) either may consent or withhold consent to health care on behalf of the patient.\n\nHISTORY: 1990 Act No. 472, Section 1; 1992 Act No. 306, Section 4; 2016 Act No. 226 (H.3999), Section 1, eff June 3, 2016; 2019 Act No. 85 (H.3602), Section 1, eff May 24, 2019.",
