      "text": "The contracting states solemnly agree that: ARTICLE I. ARTICLE II. (a) \"Sending state\" shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (b) \"Receiving state\" shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (c) \"Institution\" shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency. (d) \"Patient\" shall mean any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state for institutionalization or other care, treatment or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact. (e) \"After-care\" shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release. (f) \"Mental illness\" shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare or the welfare of others or of the community. (g) \"Mental deficiency\" shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein. (h) \"State\" shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. ARTICLE III. (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate. (c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient, furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient and given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if such authorities so wish and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient. (d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient. (e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient. ARTICLE IV. (b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive after-care or supervision in the receiving state. (c) In supervising, treating or caring for a patient on after-care pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment that it employs for similar local patients. ARTICLE V. ARTICLE VI. ARTICLE VII. (b) The sending state shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves. (c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs or responsibilities therefor. (d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact. (e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made. ARTICLE VIII. (b) The term \"guardian\" as used in paragraph (a) of this article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or responsibility for the person or property of a patient. ARTICLE IX. (b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency. ARTICLE X. (b) The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact. ARTICLE XI. ARTICLE XII. ARTICLE XIII. (b) Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by article VII (b) as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.
