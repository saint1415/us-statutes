The results of the department's evaluation must be reported to the General Assembly not later than February first of each year, beginning in 1991, in a form that will permit the General Assembly to determine whether or not hazardous waste landfill capacity in this State should be reduced.\n\n(2) No person may construct, substantially alter, or operate a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility or site, nor may a person transport, store, treat, or dispose of hazardous waste without first obtaining a permit from the department for the facility, site, or activity. Beginning July 1, 1990, permitted hazardous waste disposal sites are restricted to a rate of land disposal by burial not to exceed one hundred twenty thousand tons of hazardous waste for the twelve-month period ending July 1, 1991. On July 1, 1991, permitted hazardous waste disposal sites are restricted to a rate of land disposal by burial not to exceed one hundred ten thousand tons of hazardous waste for each twelve-month period thereafter within the permitted area of the site.\n\n(3) During a twelve-month period, the commissioner may allow land disposal by burial in excess of the limitation upon certification of the department that:\n\n(A) disposal by land burial from a particular site in South Carolina is necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of this State; or\n\n(B) at least one hundred ten thousand tons of hazardous waste disposed of by land burial in this State during the twelve-month period was generated in South Carolina.\n\nDuring each twelve-month period, a person operating a hazardous waste disposal facility or site shall reserve at least the same capacity to dispose of hazardous waste generated in South Carolina that was disposed of by burial at that facility or site during the previous year excluding capacity that was used to dispose of hazardous waste pursuant to subitem (A). No more hazardous waste from out of state shall be buried in South Carolina than was buried in the previous twelve-month period.\n\nCertification must be issued to the party seeking to use land disposal of the waste, and the certification must be presented to the operator of the facility at the time of disposal. The facility shall submit this certification with its regular report to the department of permitted activity at the disposal site.\n\n(b) Any person who:\n\n1. Owns or operates a facility required to have a permit under this section which facility is in existence on the effective date of this section;\n\n2. Has complied with the requirements of Section 44-56-120; and\n\n3.

Evidence of liability coverage for sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences in an amount the Department may determine necessary for the protection of the public health and safety, and the environment;\n\n2. Evidence of financial assurance in the form and amount as the Department may determine to be necessary to ensure that, upon abandonment, cessation, or interruption of the operation of a facility or site, all appropriate measures are taken to prevent present and future damage to the public health and safety and to the environment. The Department shall assume continuing responsibility for environmental monitoring and for any response actions necessary to ensure the health and safety of the state's citizens for any hazardous waste disposal or treatment sites permitted under this chapter when the facilities, sites, or activities close and all responsibilities required of any other party by any state or federal law or regulation cease.

Site-specific remediation standards shall be developed in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) for surface water, the site-specific remediation standard shall be, or shall demonstrate compliance with, water quality standards adopted by the department;\n\n(2) for a saturated zone or groundwater, the current and probable future use of the saturated zone or groundwater must first be identified, then site-specific sources of contaminants and potential receptors must be identified. Potential receptors must be protected, controlled, or eliminated, whether the receptors are located on or off the site where the source of the contamination is located;\n\n(3) natural environmental conditions affecting the fate and transport of contaminants, such as natural attenuation, shall be determined by the appropriate scientific methods and shall be considered a site-specific remediation standard;\n\n(4) permits for facilities located at sites covered by any of the programs or requirements established pursuant to regulation shall contain conditions to avoid exceedances of the applicable groundwater standards adopted by the department due to the continued operation of any onsite facility;\n\n(5) for soil, the soil shall be remediated to levels that are no longer a continuing source of groundwater contamination in excess of the site-specific standards.

Site-specific remediation standards also must protect against human exposure to contamination through the consumption of contaminated fish or wildlife and through the ingestion of contaminants in surface water or groundwater supplies;\n\n(7) for known or suspected carcinogens, site-specific remediation standards shall be established at exposures that represent an excess lifetime cancer risk of one in one million. The site-specific remediation standard may depart from the one-in-one million risk level based on the criteria set out in 40 C.F.R. Section 300.430(e)(9). The cumulative excess lifetime cancer risk to an exposed individual shall not be greater than one in ten thousand based on the sum of carcinogenic risk posed by each contaminant present;\n\n(8) for systemic toxicants, site-specific remediation standards shall represent levels to which the human population, including sensitive subgroups, may be exposed without any adverse health effects during a lifetime or part of a lifetime. Site-specific remediation standards for systemic toxicants shall incorporate an adequate margin of safety and shall take into account cases in which two or more systemic toxicants affect the same organ or organ system; and\n\n(9) the site-specific remediation standards for each medium shall be adequate to avoid foreseeable adverse effects to other media or the environment that are inconsistent with the risk-based approach under this section.\n\nHISTORY: 1981 Act No. 178 Part II Section 11; 1992 Act No. 267, Section 1; 2000 Act No. 258, Section 3; 2017 Act No. 16 (S.181), Section 1, eff May 9, 2017; 2022 Act No. 199 (H.4999), Section 1, eff May 16, 2022.",

The right of access remains until a complete remediation is accomplished for unrestricted use.\n\n(2) A voluntary cleanup contract shall stipulate that it:\n\n(a) is not a release or covenant not to sue for any claim or cause of action against a party who is not a signatory to the contract;\n\n(b) does not limit the right of the department to undertake future response actions;\n\n(c) is not a release or covenant not to sue for claims against a party for matters not expressly included in the contract;\n\n(d) does not release the nonresponsible party from liability for any contamination that the nonresponsible party causes or contributes to the site; and\n\n(e) becomes null and void if the nonresponsible party submits information that is false or incomplete and that is inconsistent with the intent of the contract.\n\n(3) After signing a voluntary cleanup contract, the nonresponsible party shall prepare and submit the appropriate work plans, health and safety plan, and reports to the department.

Section 9613 and Section 44-56-200, et seq. of the 1976 Code regarding environmental conditions at the site before the signing of the contract.

A restrictive covenant remains in effect until a complete remediation is accomplished for unrestricted use; and\n\n(c) include a legal description of the property and the name of the property's owner.\n\n(2) If the department determines that the nonresponsible party has not completed the contract satisfactorily, the department shall notify in writing the nonresponsible party and the current owner of the property, if different from the nonresponsible party who signed the contract, that the contract has not been satisfied and shall identify any deficiencies.\n\n(3) The covenant not to sue, liability protection, and contribution protection provided in this section shall be revoked, after reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as provided for by subsections (C)(2) and (F)(1) of this section, for a party or successor who changes the land use from the use specified in the certificate of completion to one which requires a more comprehensive cleanup.\n\n(4) The covenant not to sue, liability protection, and contribution protection provided in this section may be revoked, after reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as provided for by subsections (C)(2) and (F)(1) of this section, for a party who fails to make material progress toward the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of the property as provided for in the contract. These activities shall constitute cause to terminate the contract.\n\n(D) The department shall charge for and retain all monies collected as oversight costs. The South Carolina Hazardous Waste Contingency Fund must be reimbursed for any funds expended from the fund pursuant to Section 44-56-200.\n\n(E)(1) Upon signature of a voluntary cleanup contract by a nonresponsible party, the department shall provide notice and opportunity for public participation. Notification of the proposed contract must be placed in a newspaper in general circulation within the affected community. A comment period must be provided for thirty days from the date of newspaper publication. The public notice period must precede the department's scheduled date for execution of the contract. A public meeting must be conducted upon request to the department's Bureau of Land and Waste Management by twelve residents of South Carolina or an organization representing twelve or more residents of South Carolina. Under any other circumstances, a public meeting may be conducted at the department's discretion.\n\n(2) Beginning with the thirty-day notice period and continuing through completion of the terms of the contract, the nonresponsible party must post a sign, in clear view from the main entrance to the property, stating the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for information describing the property's response actions and reuse.\n\n(F)(1) The department or nonresponsible party may terminate a voluntary cleanup contract by giving thirty days' advance written notice to the other. The department may not terminate the contract without cause.\n\n(2) The covenant not to sue, liability protection, and contribution protection must be revoked for a party, or its successors, for conducting activities at the property that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the voluntary cleanup contract, and these activities constitute cause to terminate the contract.\n\n(3) If, after receiving notice that costs are due and owing, the nonresponsible party does not pay to the department oversight costs associated with the voluntary cleanup contract in a timely manner, the department may bring an action to recover the amount owed and all costs incurred by the department in bringing the action including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, department personnel costs, witness costs, court costs, and deposition costs.\n\n(4) Termination of the contract does not affect any right the department has under any law to require additional response actions or recover costs.\n\n(G) The department's decision to enter or not to enter into a contract is final and is not a contested case within the meaning of the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, Section 1-23-10, et seq.\n\n(H)(1) A nonresponsible party is not liable to any third party for contribution, equitable relief, or claims for damages arising from a release of contaminants, petroleum, or petroleum products that is the subject of a response action included in the nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract provided for in this section.\n\n(2) This limitation of liability commences on the date of execution of the nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract by the department; however, this limitation must be withdrawn automatically if the nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract is lawfully terminated by any party. This limitation of liability applies only to:\n\n(a) the parties to the nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract and to the nonresponsible party's lenders, signatories, parents, subsidiaries, and successors; and\n\n(b) \"existing contamination\", as defined in the nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract.\n\nThis limitation of liability does not apply to any release caused by or attributable to the nonresponsible party or its lenders, signatories, parents, subsidiaries, or successors.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 258, Section 2; 2005 Act No. 123, Section 1, eff June 3, 2005; 2008 Act No. 342, Section 1, eff June 11, 2008.",
