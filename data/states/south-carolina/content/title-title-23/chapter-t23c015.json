(B) Any public records required to be kept by the sheriff in separate books under the provisions of this section may be maintained in a computer system or may be transferred to a microfilm system provided that a second or back-up copy of the records is maintained in the event of destruction or unavailability of the records maintained by the computer or microfilm system.
