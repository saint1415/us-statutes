(d) The term \"commerce\" means any and all commerce within the State of South Carolina and subject to the jurisdiction thereof; and includes the operation of any business or service establishment. (e) The term \"hazardous substance\" means: 1. (a) Any substance or mixture of substances which (i) is toxic, (ii) is corrosive, (iii) is an irritant, (iv) is a strong sensitizer, (v) is flammable, or (vi) generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other means, if such substance or mixture of substances may cause substantial personal injury or substantial illness during or as a proximate result of any customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children. (b) Any substances which the Commissioner by regulation finds, pursuant to the provisions of Section 23-39-30(a), meet the requirements of subparagraph 1(a) of this paragraph. (c) Any radioactive substance, if, with respect to such substance as used in a particular class of article or as packaged, the Commissioner determines by regulation that the substance is sufficiently hazardous to require labeling in accordance with this chapter in order to protect public health. 2. The term \"hazardous substance\" shall not apply to economic poisons or pesticides subject to the Federal EPC Act of 1970 or the South Carolina Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, nor to foods, drugs, and cosmetics subject to the South Carolina Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, nor to substances intended for use as fuels when stored in containers and used in the heating, cooking, or refrigeration system of a house, but such term shall apply to any article which is not itself an economic poison or pesticide within the meaning of the Federal EPC Act of 1970, but which is a hazardous substance within the meaning of subparagraph 1 of this paragraph by reason of bearing or containing such an economic poison. Any pesticide or economic poison not registered in compliance with the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1970 or the South Carolina Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act shall be deemed a \"hazardous substance\" within the meaning of this chapter. 3. The term \"hazardous substance\" shall not include any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Atomic Energy Commission. (f) The term \"toxic\" shall apply to any substance (other than a radioactive substance) which has the capacity to produce personal injury or illness to man through ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through any body surface. (g)(1) The term \"highly toxic\" means any substance which falls within any of the following categories: (a) produces death within fourteen days in half or more than half of a group of ten or more laboratory white rats each weighing between two hundred and three hundred grams, at a single dose of fifty milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight, when orally administered; or (b) produces death within fourteen days in half or more than half of a group of ten or more laboratory white rats each weighing between two hundred and three hundred grams, when inhaled continuously for a period of one hour or less at an atmosphere concentration of two hundred parts per million by volume or less of gas or vapor or two milligrams per liter by volume or less of mist or dust, provided such concentration is likely to be encountered by man when the substance is used in any reasonably foreseeable manner; or (c) produces death within fourteen days in half or more than half of a group of ten or more rabbits tested in a dosage of two hundred milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight, when administered by continuous contact with the bare skin for twenty-four hours or less. (2) If the Commissioner finds that available data on human experience with any substance indicate results different from those obtained on animals in the above-named dosages or concentrations, the human data shall take precedence. (h) The term \"corrosive\" means any substance which in contact with living tissue will cause destruction of tissue by chemical action; but shall not refer to action on inanimate surfaces. (i) The term \"irritant\" means any substance not corrosive within the meaning of subparagraph (h) which on immediate, prolonged, or repeated contact with normal living tissue will induce a local inflammatory reaction. (j) The term \"strong sensitizer\" means a substance which will cause on normal living tissue, through an allergic or photodynamic process, a hypersensitivity which becomes evident on reapplication of the same substances and which is designated as such by the administrator. Before designating any substance as a strong sensitizer, the administrator, upon consideration of the frequency of occurrence and severity of the reaction, shall find that the substance has a significant potential for causing hypersensitivity. (k) The term \"extremely flammable\" shall apply to any substance which has a flash point at or below twenty degrees Fahrenheit as determined by the Tagliabue Open Cup Tester, and the term \"flammable\" shall apply to any substance which has a flash point of above twenty degrees to and including eighty degrees Fahrenheit, as determined by the Tagliabue Open Cup Tester; except that the flammability of solids and of the contents of self-pressurized containers shall be determined by methods found by the Commissioner to be generally applicable to such materials or containers, respectively, and established by regulations issued by him, which regulations shall also define the terms \"flammable\" and \"extremely flammable\" in accord with such methods. (l) The term \"radioactive substance\" means a substance which emits ionizing radiation. (m) The term \"label\" means a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any substance, or in the case of an article which is unpackaged or is not packaged in an immediate container intended or suitable for delivery to the ultimate consumer, a display of such matter directly upon the article involved or upon a tag or other suitable material affixed thereto, and a requirement made by or under authority of this chapter that any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears (1) on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, unless it is easily legible through the outside container or wrapper and (2) on all accompanying literature where there are directions for use, written, or otherwise. (n) The term \"immediate container\" does not include package liners. (o) The term \"misbranded hazardous substance\" means a hazardous substance (including a toy, or other article intended for use by children, which is a hazardous substance, or which bears or contains a hazardous substance in such manner as to be susceptible of access by a child to whom such toy or other article is entrusted) intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children, which substance, except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to Section 23-39-30, fails to bear a label (1) which states conspicuously (a) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller; (b) the common or usual name or the chemical name (if there be no common or usual name) of the hazardous substance or of each component which contributes substantially to its hazard, unless the Commissioner by regulation permits or requires the use of a recognized generic name; (c) the signal word \"DANGER\" on substances which are extremely flammable, corrosive, or highly toxic; (d) the signal word \"WARNING\" or \"CAUTION\" on all other hazardous substances; (e) an affirmative statement of the principal hazard or hazards, such as \"Flammable,\" \"Vapor Harmful,\" \"Causes Burns,\" \"Absorbed Through Skin,\" or similar wording descriptive of the hazard; (f) precautionary measures describing the action to be followed or avoided, except when modified by regulation of the administrator pursuant to Section 23-39-30; (g) instruction, when necessary or appropriate, for first-aid treatment; (h) the word \"poison\" for any hazardous substance which is defined as \"highly toxic\" by subsection (g); (i) instructions for handling and storage of packages which require special care in handling or storage and; (j) the statement (i) \"Keep out of the reach of children\" or its practical equivalent, or (ii) if the article is intended for use by children and is not a banned hazardous substance, adequate directions for the protection of children from the hazard, and (2) on which any statement required under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are located prominently and are in the English language in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. (p)(1) The term \"banned hazardous substance\" means (a) any toy, or other article intended for use by children, which is a hazardous substance, or which bears or contains a hazardous substance in such manner as to be susceptible of access by a child to whom such toy or other article is entrusted; or (b) any hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in household, which the administrator by regulation classifies as a \"banned hazardous substance\" on the basis of a finding that, notwithstanding such cautionary labeling as is or may be required under this chapter for that substance, the degree or nature of the hazard involved in the presence or use of such substance in households is such that the objective of the protection of the public health and safety can be adequately served only by keeping such substance, when so intended or packaged, out of the channels of commerce: Provided, that the Commissioner, by regulation, (i) shall exempt from clause (a) of this paragraph articles, such as chemical sets, which by reason of their functional purpose require the inclusion of the hazardous substance involved, and which bear labeling giving adequate directions and warnings for safe use and are intended for use by children who have attained sufficient maturity, and may reasonably be expected, to read and heed such directions and warnings, and (ii) shall exempt from clause (a) and provide for the labeling of, common fireworks (including toy paper caps, cone fountains, cylinder fountains, whistles without report, and sparklers) to the extent that he determines that such articles can be adequately labeled to protect the purchasers and users thereof. (2) Proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations pursuant to clause (b) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be governed by the provisions of Section 23-39-30.

      "text": "(a) Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner such action will promote the objectives of this chapter by avoiding or resolving uncertainty as to application, the Commissioner may by regulation declare to be a hazardous substance, for the purposes of this chapter, any substance or mixture of substances which he finds meets the requirements of subparagraph 1(a) of Section 23-39-20(e). (b) If the Commissioner finds that the requirements of Section 23-39-20(o)(1) are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety in view of the special hazard presented by any particular hazardous substance, he may by regulation establish such reasonable variations or additional label requirements as he finds necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children, which fails to bear a label in accordance with such regulations shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance. (c) If the Commissioner finds that, because of the size of the package involved or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance contained therein, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with the labeling requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety, the Commissioner shall promulgate regulations exempting such substances from these requirements to the extent he determines to be consistent with adequate protection of the public health and safety. (d) If the Commissioner finds that the hazard of an article subject to this chapter is such that labeling adequate to protect the public health and safety cannot be devised, or the article presents an imminent danger to the public health and safety, the Commissioner may declare such article to be a banned hazardous substance and require its removal from commerce.

(c) The receipt in commerce of any misbranded hazardous substance or banned hazardous substance and the delivery or proffered delivery thereof for pay or otherwise. (d) The giving of a guarantee or undertaking referred to in Section 23-39-50(b)(2) which guarantee or undertaking is false, except by a person who relied upon a guarantee or undertaking to the same effect signed by, and containing the name and address of, the person residing in the United States from whom he received in good faith the hazardous substance.

The reuse of a food, drug, or cosmetic container as a container for a hazardous substance shall be deemed to be an act which results in the hazardous substance being a misbranded hazardous substance. As used in this paragraph, the terms \"food,\" \"drug,\" and \"cosmetic\" shall have the same meanings as in the South Carolina Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (g) The use by any person to his own advantage, or revealing other than to the Commissioner or officers or employees of the agency, or to the courts when relevant in any judicial proceeding under this chapter, of any information acquired under authority of Section 23-39-100 concerning any method of process which as a trade secret is entitled to protection.
