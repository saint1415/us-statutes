By filing this agreement, I request that the applicable law enforcement agency enforce the prohibition of the discharge of fireworks on said subject property and, if applicable, any adjoining public property to which the local governing body has extended the Fireworks Prohibited Zone to the fullest extent of the law. I acknowledge that this Discharge of Fireworks Prohibited Agreement exists only for the time period that I own, lease, or manage the subject property, or until I rescind the agreement, whichever occurs first. I agree to post two signs or placards measuring not less than twelve inches by twelve inches in conspicuous locations on the subject property.

I am attaching with this application a copy of the Discharge of Fireworks Prohibited Agreement. I have circled the following applicable description of the public property onto which I request the zone to be extended: (a) to the low-water mark of all oceanic bodies of water adjoining the subject property; (b) to the center line of any street or thoroughfare that abuts the subject property; or (c) onto any public land sharing a common boundary with the subject property for a distance not to exceed five hundred feet. Below I have briefly described the public property onto which this application proposes to extend the fireworks prohibited zone: _ _ _ _ If authorized by a decision of the local governing body to extend the Fireworks Prohibited Zone, I agree to identify the subject property and extended public property included in the Fireworks Prohibited Zone on two signs or placards measuring not less than twelve inches by twelve inches posted in conspicuous locations on the subject property. _ OWNER, LESSEE, OR MANAGING AUTHORITY _ WITNESS (3) A local governing body may provide by ordinance for additional information to be included in the application. The local governing body must not require a fee for this application. (4) In considering whether a Fireworks Prohibited Zone may be extended onto public property as provided in item (1), the local governing body must: (a) schedule a public hearing within a reasonable time from which the application is made; (b) give fifteen days' public notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the community; and (c) receive testimony from interested persons, their agents, or their attorneys at the public hearing. (5) No later than five calendar days following the public hearing, the local governing body must issue a written decision, including all findings of fact and rationales upon which the determination is made, concerning whether the Fireworks Prohibited Zone is to be extended. If the local governing body authorizes the extension of a Fireworks Prohibited Zone, the local governing body's decision must be filed by the owner, lessee, or managing authority with the Discharge of Fireworks Prohibited Agreement for the subject property at the local law enforcement agency. (F) A local governing body or local law enforcement agency is authorized to post appropriate signs or placards indicating the location of Fireworks Prohibited Zones in areas where contiguous properties have filed a Discharge of Fireworks Prohibited Agreement. (G) A person may be prosecuted pursuant to the provisions of this section only if the subject property of the Fireworks Prohibited Zone is posted as required by this section. (H) Unless restricted or prohibited by a lease or contract, a lessee may establish a Fireworks Prohibited Zone and apply for an extension of the zone onto public property as provided in this section during the time of the lease. (I) A Discharge of Fireworks Prohibited Agreement exists only: (1) during the ownership, lease, or authority of the person filing the agreement; or (2) until the owner, lessee, or managing authority rescinds the agreement by withdrawing the documentation filed with the local law enforcement agency. If the subject property is no longer established as a Fireworks Prohibited Zone, any extension by a local governing body of the Fireworks Prohibited Zone to public property is unenforceable. (J) The provisions of this section do not apply to a professional fireworks display show or demonstration that has been permitted or licensed to operate by the local governing body or has been authorized to operate as provided by law. (K) Nothing in this section is designed to abrogate any civil remedies available under statutory or common law. HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 6, Section 1.
