Relevant information includes:\n\n(1) pertinent insurance policy information relevant to a fire loss under investigation and any application for such a policy;\n\n(2) policy premium payment records which are available;\n\n(3) history of previous claims made by the insured;\n\n(4) material relating to the investigation of the loss, including statements of any person, proof of loss, and any other evidence relevant to the investigation.\n\n(b) When an insurance company has reason to believe that a fire loss in which it has an interest may be of other than accidental cause, the company may notify, in writing, an authorized agency and provide it with any or all material developed from the company's inquiry into the fire loss; however, when such information includes possible evidence of arson or other unlawful burning involving specifically named persons, the information in all cases may be furnished to the solicitor in the circuit where the fire occurred and he shall furnish the information to other properly authorized agencies if he considers such action to be appropriate. When an insurance company provides any one of the authorized agencies with notice of a fire loss, it is sufficient notice for the purpose of this chapter.\n\n(c) When an insurance company denies payment of a claim to an insured on grounds of arson, false swearing, material misrepresentation, fraud, or similar claim or defense such insurer shall in all cases notify in writing the Director of the Department of Insurance. The Director of the Department of Insurance may notify, after the investigation, an authorized agency if he considers the action to be appropriate.\n\n(d) The authorized agency provided with information pursuant to this chapter may release or provide such information to any agency asked to participate in the investigation.\n\n(e) Any insurance company providing information to an authorized agency pursuant to this chapter has the right to be informed, upon written request, as to the status of the case by such agency within a reasonable time, as determined by the authorized agency.\n\n(f) Any insurance company or authorized agency which notifies the Director of the Department of Insurance or provides or releases information, whether oral or written, and any person acting in their behalf, pursuant to this chapter is immune from any liability arising out of such notification or release.\n\nHISTORY: 1984 Act No. 436, Section 1; 1989 Act No. 148, Section 27; 1993 Act No. 181, Sections 366, 367.",
