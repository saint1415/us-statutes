If the firearms qualification program approved by the director is not available within three working days after receipt of the notice, then the public law enforcement agency making the request for the firearms qualification program may employ the person to perform any of the duties of a law enforcement officer, including those involving the control and direction of members of the public and exercising the power of arrest. Should any such person fail to secure certification within one year from his date of employment, he may not perform any of the duties of a law enforcement officer involving control or direction of members of the public or exercising the power of arrest until he has been certified. He is not eligible for employment or appointment by any other agency in South Carolina as a law enforcement officer, nor is he eligible for any compensation by any law enforcement agency for services performed as an officer. Exceptions to the one-year rule may be granted by the director in these cases:\n\n(1) military leave or injury occurring during that first year which would preclude the receiving of training within the usual period of time; or\n\n(2) in the event of the timely filing of application for training, which application, under circumstances of time and physical limitations, cannot be honored by the training academy within the prescribed period; or\n\n(3) upon presentation of documentary evidence that the officer-candidate has successfully completed equivalent training in one of the other states which by law regulate and supervise the quality of police training and which require a minimum basic or recruit course of duration and content at least equivalent to that provided in this chapter or by standards set by the council; or\n\n(4) if it is determined by documentary evidence that the training will result in undue hardship to the requesting agency, the requesting agency must propose an alternate training schedule for approval.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding another provision of law, in the case of a candidate for certification who begins one or more periods of state or federal military service within one year after his date of employment or appointment, the period of time within which he must obtain the certification required to become a law enforcement officer is automatically extended for an additional period equal to the aggregate period of time the candidate performed active duty or active duty for training as a member of the National Guard, the State Guard, or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, plus ninety days. The director must take all necessary and proper action to ensure that a candidate for certification as a law enforcement officer who performs military service within one year of his employment or appointment is not prejudiced in obtaining certification as a result of having performed state or federal military service.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 317, Section 1, eff May 30, 2006; 2014 Act No. 225 (H.3958), Section 1, eff June 2, 2014; 2022 Act No. 218 (H.3050), Section 1, eff May 23, 2022.",

This notification shall be sent to the public law enforcement agency head via certified U.S. Mail or delivered by hand. The agency must come into compliance within thirty days.\n\n(B) If after thirty days the public law enforcement agency has failed to come into compliance, the director, at the direction of the council, shall issue an order requiring the public law enforcement agency to comply with the provision or regulation. This order may include a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation per day the agency is not in compliance or is found in violation. Any public law enforcement agency against which a civil penalty is invoked by the director may appeal the decision to the court of common pleas of the county where the public law enforcement agency is located.\n\n(C) If the public law enforcement agency has failed to comply with the director's order, the director shall either bring a civil action for injunctive relief or a civil enforcement action for failure to comply with the order in the court of common pleas of the county where the public law enforcement agency is located. Violation of any court order issued pursuant to this section must be considered in contempt of the issuing court and punishable as provided by law.\n\n(D) If the imposition of civil fines fails to bring a law enforcement agency into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter, or an order authorized in this chapter, the council is authorized to temporarily hold in abeyance the law enforcement certification of every law enforcement officer employed or appointed by the noncompliant law enforcement agency until such time as the council deems the agency to be in compliance with the minimum standards or a motion for injunctive relief is settled. An individual whose law enforcement certification has been held in abeyance by the council is not authorized to enforce the laws or ordinances of this State or any political subdivision thereof. An individual who has had his law enforcement certification held in abeyance as a result of a noncompliant law enforcement agency shall not be prohibited from regaining law enforcement certification if he is subsequently employed or appointed by a compliant law enforcement agency, provided he is otherwise qualified to be certified. Further, in the event the council holds law enforcement certifications in abeyance at a noncompliant law enforcement agency, no law enforcement officer shall go without his or her regular pay, compensation, and benefits. Any records for the certification hold for the individual officer must be expunged by the council within thirty days of the termination of the hold after full compliance by the agency or the employment by another agency.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 317, Section 1, eff May 30, 2006; 2014 Act No. 225 (H.3958), Section 1, eff June 2, 2014; 2022 Act No. 218 (H.3050), Section 6, eff May 23, 2022.",
