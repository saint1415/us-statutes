After the evaluation by the qualified evaluator designated by the department, if the offender or the prosecutor seeks an independent evaluation by an independent qualified evaluator, then that evaluation must be completed within ninety days after receipt of the request by the department evaluator. The court may grant an extension upon the request of the independent qualified evaluator and a showing of extraordinary circumstances. Any qualified evaluator who will be submitted as an expert at a hearing on the motion must submit a written report available to both parties.\n\n(F) The court must make a determination upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the offender is no longer a foreseeable risk to reoffend and that it is in the best interest of justice to grant the motion for removal from the requirement of registration.\n\n(G) The State of South Carolina must be named as the respondent to the action and shall be represented by the prosecution office that obtained the underlying conviction for which the offender is required to register, or, if the conviction occurred outside of the State, the Attorney General.

The following agencies have standing to request to be made a party to the motion:\n\n(1) any original prosecuting solicitor's office for an underlying qualifying conviction if not already representing the State;\n\n(2) the local solicitor's office where the offender resides at the time of the hearing if not already representing the State; or\n\n(3) the Attorney General's Office if not already representing the State.\n\n(H) If a person is convicted of multiple offenses requiring registration, and the offenses fall within different tiers, the person only may petition for removal of the registration requirement once the required time passes for the highest tier offense they have been convicted of that requires registration.\n\n(I) If the motion is denied, the person may not file for removal from the registry pursuant to this section again until five years after the date of the final order.\n\nHISTORY: 2022 Act No. 221 (H.4075), Section 5, eff May 23, 2022.",

If evidence is presented at the criminal proceeding and the court makes a specific finding on the record that the conviction obtained for this offense resulted from illicit consensual sexual conduct, as contained in Section 16-3-655(B)(2), provided the offender is eighteen years of age or less, or consensual sexual conduct between persons under sixteen years of age, then the convicted person is not required to be electronically monitored pursuant to the provisions of this section;\n\n(c) criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the third degree (Section 16-3-655(C));\n\n(d) engaging a child for sexual performance (Section 16-3-810);\n\n(e) producing, directing, or promoting sexual performance by a child (Section 16-3-820);\n\n(f) criminal sexual conduct: assaults with intent to commit (Section 16-3-656) involving a minor;\n\n(g) violations of Article 3, Chapter 15, Title 16 involving a minor;\n\n(h) kidnapping (Section 16-3-910) of a person under eighteen years of age except when the offense is committed by a parent;\n\n(i) trafficking in persons (Section 16-3-2020) of a person under eighteen years of age except when the court makes a finding on the record that the offense did not include a criminal sexual offense or an attempted criminal sexual offense; or\n\n(2) ordered as a condition of sentencing to be included in the sex offender registry pursuant to Section 23-3-430(D) for an offense involving a minor, except that the provisions of this item may not be construed to apply to a person eighteen years of age or less who engages in illicit but consensual sexual conduct with another person who is at least fourteen years of age as provided in Section 16-3-655(B)(2).\n\n(H) The person shall be monitored by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services with an active electronic monitoring device for the duration of the time the person is required to remain on the sex offender registry pursuant to the provisions of this article, unless the person is committed to the custody of the State. Ten years from the date the person begins to be electronically monitored, the person may petition the chief administrative judge of the general sessions court for the county in which the person was ordered to be electronically monitored for an order to be released from the electronic monitoring requirements of this section. The person shall serve a copy of the petition upon the solicitor of the circuit and the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The court must hold a hearing before ordering the person to be released from the electronic monitoring requirements of this section, unless the court denies the petition because the person is not eligible for release or based on other procedural grounds. The solicitor of the circuit, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, and any victims, as defined in Article 15, Chapter 3, Title 16, must be notified of any hearing pursuant to this subsection and must be given an opportunity to testify or submit affidavits in response to the petition. If the court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the person has complied with the terms and conditions of the electronic monitoring and that there is no longer a need to electronically monitor the person, then the court may order the person to be released from the electronic monitoring requirements of this section. If the court denies the petition or refuses to grant the order, then the person may refile a new petition every five years from the date the court denies the petition or refuses to grant the order. A person may not petition the court if the person is required to register pursuant to this article for committing criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree, pursuant to Section 16-3-655(A)(1), or criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the third degree, pursuant to Section 16-3-655(C).\n\n(I) The person shall follow instructions provided by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services to maintain the active electronic monitoring device in working order. Incidental damage or defacement of the active electronic monitoring device must be reported to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services within two hours.

The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may exempt a person from the payment of a part or all of the cost during a part or all of the duration of the time the person is required to be electronically monitored, if the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services determines that exceptional circumstances exist such that these payments cause a severe hardship to the person. The payment of the cost must be a condition of supervision of the person and a delinquency of two months or more in making payments may operate as a violation of a term or condition of the electronic monitoring. All fees generated by this subsection must be retained by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, carried forward, and applied to support the active electronic monitoring of sex offenders.\n\n(L) A person who intentionally removes, tampers with, defaces, alters, damages, or destroys an active electronic monitoring device is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years.

For a person sentenced to one hundred eighty days or less, the Department of Corrections shall immediately notify the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services.\n\n(O) When an inmate serving a sentence as described in this section is released on electronic monitoring, a victim who has previously requested notification and the sheriff's office in the county where the person is to be released must be notified in accordance with the requirements of Article 15, Chapter 3, Title 16.\n\n(P) As used in this section, \"active electronic monitoring device\" means an all body worn device that is not removed from the person's body utilized by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services in conjunction with a web-based computer system that actively monitors and records a person's location at least once every minute twenty-four hours a day and that timely records and reports the person's presence near or within a prohibited area or the person's departure from a specified geographic location. In addition, the device must be resistant or impervious to unintentional or wilful damages. The South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy may offer training to officers of the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services regarding the utilization of active electronic monitoring devices. In areas of the State where cellular coverage requires the use of an alternate device, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may use an alternate device.\n\n(Q) Except for juveniles released from the Department of Corrections, all juveniles adjudicated delinquent in family court, who are required to be monitored pursuant to the provisions of this article by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, or who are ordered by a court to be monitored must be supervised, while under the jurisdiction of the family court or Board of Juvenile Parole, by the Department of Juvenile Justice. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall report to the Department of Juvenile Justice all violations of the terms or conditions of electronic monitoring for all juveniles supervised by the department, for as long as the family court or Juvenile Parole Board has jurisdiction over the juvenile. If the Department of Juvenile Justice determines that a juvenile has violated a term or condition of electronic monitoring, the department shall immediately notify local law enforcement of the violation.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 141, Section 8; 2006 Act No. 342, Section 6, eff July 1, 2006; 2006 Act No. 346, Section 3, eff July 1, 2006; 2008 Act No. 335, Sections 15, 20, eff June 16, 2008; 2010 Act No. 289, Section 11, eff June 11, 2010; 2012 Act No. 255, Section 7, eff June 18, 2012; 2015 Act No. 7 (S.196), Section 6.F, eff April 2, 2015.",
