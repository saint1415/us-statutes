The input must be considered in the procurement of a statewide voting system.\n\n(B) Before any kind of optical scan voting system is used at any election, it must be approved by the State Election Commission, which shall examine the optical scan voting system and make and file in the commission's office a report, attested by the signature of the commission's executive director, stating whether, in the commission's opinion, the kind of optical scan voting system examined may be accurately and efficiently used by electors at elections, as provided by law. An optical scan voting system may not be approved for use in the State unless certified by a testing laboratory accredited by the Federal Election Assistance Commission as meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of the latest federal voting system standards and guidelines. If the federal voting system standards and guidelines have been amended less than thirty-six months prior to an election, then the State Election Commission may approve and certify a voting system that meets the prior standards after determining:\n\n(1) the effect that such approval would have on the integrity and security of elections; and\n\n(2) the procedure and cost involved to bring the voting system into compliance with the amended standards.\n\n(C) No kind of vote recorder not approved pursuant to this section shall be used at any election and if, upon the reexamination of any type vote recorder previously approved, it appears that the vote recorder so reexamined can no longer be accurately and efficiently used by electors at elections as provided by law, the approval of the vote recorder must immediately be revoked by the State Election Commission, and no such type vote recorder shall thereafter be purchased for use or used in this State.\n\n(D) If a vote recorder, including an optical scan voting system, which was approved for use before July 1, 1999, is improved or otherwise changed in a way since its approval that does not impair its accuracy, efficiency, or capacity, the vote recorder may be used in elections. However, if the software, hardware, or firmware of the system is improved or otherwise changed, the system must comply with the requirements of subsection (B).\n\n(E) Any person or company who requests an examination of any type of vote recorder or optical scan voting system shall pay a nonrefundable examination fee of one thousand dollars for a new voting system and a nonrefundable examination fee of five hundred dollars for an upgrade to any existing system to the State Election Commission. The State Election Commission may at any time, in its discretion, reexamine any vote recorder or optical scan voting system when evidence is presented to the commission that the accuracy or the ability of the system to be used satisfactorily in the conduct of elections is in question.\n\n(F) Any person or company who seeks approval for any vote recorder or optical scan voting system in this State must file with the State Election Commission a list of all states or jurisdictions in which the system has been approved for use. This list must state how long the system has been used in the state; contain the name, address, and telephone number of that state or jurisdiction's chief election official; and must disclose any reports compiled by state or local government concerning the performance of the system. The vendor is responsible for filing this information on an ongoing basis.\n\n(G) Any person or company who seeks approval for any vote recorder or optical scan voting system must file with the State Election Commission copies of all contracts and maintenance agreements used in connection with the sale of the voting system. All changes to standard contracts and maintenance agreements must be filed with the State Election Commission.\n\n(H) Any person or company who seeks approval for any vote recorder or optical scan voting system must conduct, under the supervision of the State Election Commission and any county board of voter registration and elections, a field test for any new voting system, as part of the certification process. The field test shall involve South Carolina voters and election officials and must be conducted as part of a scheduled primary, general, or special election. This test must be held in two or more precincts, and all costs relating to the voting system must be borne by the vendor. The test must be designed to gauge voter reaction to the system, problems that voters have with the system, and the number of voting units required for the efficient operation of an election. The test must also demonstrate the accuracy of votes cast and reported on the system.\n\n(I) Before an optical scan voting system may be used in elections in the State, all source codes for the system must be placed in escrow by the manufacturer, at the manufacturer's expense, with the authority approved by the Federal Election Assistance Commission. These source codes must be available to the State Election Commission in case the company goes out of business, pursuant to court order, or if the State Election Commission determines that an examination of these source codes is necessary. The manufacturer shall place all updates of these source codes in escrow, and notify the State Election Commission that this requirement has been met.\n\n(J) After a vote recorder or optical scan voting system is approved, an improvement or change in the system must be submitted to the State Election Commission for approval pursuant to this section; however, this requirement does not apply to the technical capability of a general purpose computer or printer to accurately reproduce vote totals.\n\n(K) If the State Election Commission determines that a vote recorder or optical scan voting system that was approved no longer meets the requirements set forth in subsections (B) and (D) or Section 7-13-1340, the commission may decertify that system. A decertified system shall not be used in elections unless the system is reapproved by the commission under subsections (B) and (D).\n\n(L) Neither a member of the State Election Commission, any county board of voter registration and elections or custodian, nor a member of a county governing body shall have any pecuniary interest in any vote recorder, or in the manufacture or sale of the vote recorder.\n\n(M) An optical scan voting system must maintain an image of each ballot that is cast in a manner that protects the integrity of the data and the anonymity of each voter.\n\n(N) All electronic records for a statewide election must be preserved for not less than twenty-four months following the election.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 23-400.103; 1970 (56) 2022; 1999 Act No. 103, Section 4, eff June 30, 1999; 2005 Act No. 63, Section 3, eff May 16, 2005; 2022 Act No. 150 (S.108), Section 13, eff May 13, 2022.",

If it is determined that the voter has violated the instruction for marking the ballot, then the entire ballot shall be tabulated by the precinct officials and the results certified to the counting station, or the county board of voter registration and elections may cause a duplicate to be made of that part of the ballot marked according to such instructions.\n\nProvided, that if it appears that a ballot is so torn, bent, or otherwise defaced or has been marked by other than the marking device, so that it cannot be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment, the county board of voter registration and elections may cause a duplicate of each such ballot to be marked so that it can be so counted.\n\nSuch duplicate ballots, when so authorized by the board of voter registration and elections, shall be prepared at the counting station in the presence of witnesses and substituted for the original ballots, which duplicate ballots shall be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment. The original ballots shall be preserved and all such duplicate ballots shall be clearly labeled with the word \"duplicate\" and shall bear a serial number which shall also be recorded on the original. At the counting station, write-in votes tabulated by the precinct officials shall be added to the results from ballots tabulated with the automatic tabulating equipment and the totals certified as the precinct count on the summary sheet.\n\n(g) Put the unused ballots with the stubs attached, and soiled and defaced ballots with the stubs attached, in the envelopes or containers provided and certify the number. The voted ballots shall be placed in designated containers provided by the county board of voter registration and elections for use with automatic tabulating equipment, sealed, and the containers shall be sealed. Officials duly authorized by the county board of voter registration and elections shall then transport all of the ballots, precinct election supplies and records to the location designated by the board of voter registration and elections for the processing or counting, or both, of such ballots.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 23-400.111; 1970 (56) 2022.",

A voting system may not be approved for use in the State unless certified by a testing laboratory accredited by the Federal Election Assistance Commission as meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of the latest federal voting system standards and guidelines. If the federal voting system standards and guidelines have been amended less than thirty-six months prior to an election, then the State Election Commission may approve and certify a voting system that meets the prior standards after determining:\n\n(1) the effect that such approval would have on the integrity and security of elections; and\n\n(2) the procedure and cost involved to bring the voting system into compliance with the amended standards.\n\n(B) A person or company who requests an examination of any type of voting system shall pay a nonrefundable examination fee of one thousand dollars for a new voting system. A nonrefundable examination fee of five hundred dollars must be paid for an upgrade to any existing system. The State Election Commission may reexamine any voting system when evidence is presented to the commission that the accuracy or the ability of the system to be used satisfactorily in the conduct of elections is in question.\n\n(C) A person or company who seeks approval for any type of voting system in this State shall file with the State Election Commission a list of all states or jurisdictions in which that voting system has been approved for use. This list must state how long the system has been used in the state; contain the name, address, and telephone number of that state or jurisdiction's chief election official; and disclose any reports compiled by state or local government concerning the performance of the system. The vendor is responsible for filing this information on an ongoing basis.\n\n(D) A person or an individual who seeks approval for any type of voting system shall file with the State Election Commission copies of all contracts and maintenance agreements used in connection with the sale of the voting system. All changes to standard contracts and maintenance agreements must be filed with the State Election Commission.\n\n(E) A person or company who seeks approval for any voting system shall conduct, under the supervision of the State Election Commission and any county board of voter registration and elections, a field test for any new voting system, as part of the certification process. The field test must involve South Carolina voters and election officials, and must be conducted as part of a scheduled primary, general, or special election. This test must be held in two or more precincts, and all costs relating to the use of the voting system must be borne by the vendor. The test must be designed to gauge voter reaction to the system, problems that voters have with the system, and the number of units required for the efficient operation of an election. The test also must demonstrate the accuracy of votes reported on the system.\n\n(F) Before a voting system may be used in elections in the State, all source codes for the system must be placed in escrow by the manufacturer at the manufacturer's expense with the authority approved by the Federal Election Assistance Commission. These source codes must be available to the State Election Commission in case the company goes out of business, pursuant to court order, or if the State Election Commission determines that an examination of these source codes is necessary. The manufacturer shall place all updates of these source codes in escrow, and notify the State Election Commission that this requirement has been met.\n\n(G) After a voting system is approved, an improvement or change in the system must be submitted to the State Election Commission for approval pursuant to this section. This requirement does not apply to the technical capability of a general purpose computer, reader, or printer used for election preparation or ballot tally reporting.\n\n(H) If the State Election Commission determines that a voting system that was approved no longer meets the requirements of Title 7, the commission shall decertify that system. A decertified system must not be used in an election unless it is reapproved by the commission pursuant to the provisions of Title 7.\n\n(I)(1) A vendor of any voting system that has been approved by the State Election Commission shall report in writing to the Director of the State Election Commission any decertification, ethical, or technical violations against the voting system in any state within ninety days after the decertification, ethical, or technical violations are issued by the other state. If the vendor does not provide evidence to the State Election Commission's satisfaction that the voting system deficiencies have been corrected to comply with the provisions of South Carolina law, then the voting system may be decertified.\n\n(2) A vendor seeking the approval of a voting system by the State Election Commission shall report in writing to the Director of the State Election Commission any decertification, ethical, or technical violations issued against the voting system in any state that have occurred prior to or during the time the vendor seeks approval of the voting system by the State Election Commission. If the vendor does not provide evidence to the State Election Commission's satisfaction that the voting system deficiencies have been corrected to comply with the provisions of South Carolina law, then the voting system may not be approved.\n\n(J) A member of the State Election Commission, county board of voter registration and elections, custodian, or member of a county governing body may not have a pecuniary interest in any voting system or in the manufacture or sale of any voting system.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 23-402; 1952 Code Section 23-402; 1950 (46) 2059; 1971 (57) 85; 1999 Act No. 103, Section 6, eff June 30, 1999; 2005 Act No. 63, Section 4, eff May 16, 2005; 2022 Act No. 150 (S.108), Section 15, eff May 13, 2022.",
