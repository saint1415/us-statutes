HISTORY: 2024 Act No. 110 (H.4352), Section 1, eff February 5, 2024. Code Commissioner's Note At the direction of the Code Commissioner, Section 53-3-270, as added by 2024 Act No. 110, Section 1, was redesignated as Section 53-3-310 to accommodate the addition of Section 53-3-270, added by 2023 Act No. 34, Section 1. Editor's Note 2024 Act No. 110, preamble, provides as follows: \"Whereas, middle school, also known as intermediate school or junior high school, is an important time in a student's educational development. Students develop more critical thinking skills and begin to choose electives based on their personal interests; and \"Whereas, the middle school creates a positive environment for adolescents to develop socially, emotionally, psychologically, and academically; and \"Whereas, middle school students are on a journey to discover their identities as individuals. Guidance through communication is key, when dealing with young adults; and \"Whereas, the essential role that middle school education plays in the formative years of adolescents is contributed to the dedication and hard work of the middle school educators, administrators, and support personnel; and \"Whereas, middle school educators, parents, and guardians must provide students with proper orientation and supervision, ensuring all students will be college and career ready; and \"Whereas, middle school eighth-grade level is a critical year because testing at this grade level provides statistics of a student's ability to succeed; and \"Whereas, parents are less involved than they are in elementary school giving students more freedom and independence but also more responsibility. Students in middle school experience a more rigorous course load and can take advanced classes in subjects in which they excel; and \"Whereas, middle school is a significant time in every student's educational journey and deserves to be recognized for its importance. Now, therefore, [text of Act].\"",
