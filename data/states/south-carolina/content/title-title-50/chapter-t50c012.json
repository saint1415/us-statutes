      "text": "The Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact is enacting into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein. The Department of Natural Resources shall execute all documents and perform all other acts necessary to carry out the provisions of the compact. ARTICLE I Findings, Declaration of Policy, and Purpose (A) The party states find that: (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors. (2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources. (3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources. (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries. Therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife. (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property. (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states. (7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state: (a) must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; (b) if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or (c) is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance. (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in item (7) of this subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation. (9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation. (10) The practice described in item (7) of this subsection causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made. (11) The enforcement practices described in item (7) of this subsection consume an undue amount of law enforcement time. (B) It is the policy of the party states to: (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states. (2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state. (3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subsection (B) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact. (4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state. (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state. (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state. (7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information. (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations. (C) The purposes of this compact are to: (1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subsection (B) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner. (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state. ARTICLE II Definitions Unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions in this article apply through this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact: (1) \"Citation\" means any summons, complaint, ticket, penalty assessment, or other official document issued by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation containing an order which requires the person to respond. (2) \"Collateral\" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation. (3) \"Compliance\" with respect to a citation means the act of answering the citation through appearance at a court, a tribunal, or payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any, or both such appearance and payment. (4) \"Conviction\" means a conviction, including any court conviction, of or offense related to the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of wildlife which is prohibited by state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule, or a forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, or payment of a penalty assessment, or a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a deferred or suspended sentence by the court. (5) \"Court\" means a court of law, including magistrates court. (6) \"Home state\" means the state of primary residence of a person. (7) \"Issuing state\" means the party state which issues a wildlife citation to the violator. (8) \"License\" means any license, permit, or other public document which conveys to the person to whom it was issued the privilege of pursuing, possessing, or taking any wildlife regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule of a party state. (9) \"Licensing authority\" means the department or division within each party state which is authorized by law to issue or approve licenses or permits to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife. (10) \"Party state\" means any state which enacts legislation to become a member of this wildlife compact.

(17) \"Wildlife officer\" means any individual authorized by a party state to issue a citation for a wildlife violation. (18) \"Wildlife violation\" means any cited violation of a statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule developed and enacted to manage wildlife resources and their use. ARTICLE III Procedures for Issuing State (A) When issuing a citation for a wildlife violation, a wildlife officer shall issue a citation to any person whose primary residence is in a party state in the same manner as if the person were a resident of the home state and shall not require the person to post collateral to secure appearance, subject to the exceptions contained in subsection (B) of this article, if the officer receives the person's personal recognizance that the person will comply with the terms of the citation. (B) Personal recognizance is acceptable: (1) if it is not prohibited by local law or the compact manual; and (2) if the violator provides adequate proof of the violator's identification to the wildlife officer.

(C) The licensing authority of the home state shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing states as provided in the compact manual. ARTICLE V Reciprocal Recognition of Suspension (A) All party states shall recognize the suspension of license privileges of any person by any state as if the violation on which the suspension is based occurred in their state and could have been the basis for suspension of license privileges in their state.

ARTICLE VI Applicability of Other Laws Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing in it shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its laws relating to license privileges to a person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent any agreement or other cooperative arrangements between a party state and a nonparty state concerning wildlife law enforcement.
