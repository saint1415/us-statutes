      "text": "The Interstate Boating Violator Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein. The Department of Natural Resources shall execute all documents and perform all other acts necessary to carry out the provisions of the compact in a form substantially as follows:\n\nARTICLE I Findings, Declaration of Policy, and Purpose(A) The party states find that:\n\nARTICLE I Findings, Declaration of Policy, and Purpose\n\n(1) Boating activities on public waters are managed by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.\n\n(2) The benefits of boating activities on public waters can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those activities.\n\n(3) The management of boating activities on public waters contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of the respective states.\n\n(4) Boating activities on public waters are valuable without regard to political boundaries. Therefore, all persons should be required to comply with boating laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the privilege of operating watercraft on public waters.\n\n(5) Violation of boating laws interferes with the management of boating activities on public waters and may endanger the safety of persons and property.\n\n(6) The mobility of many boating law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the respective states.\n\n(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a boating violation in a state other than the person's home state:\n\n(a) must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date;\n\n(b) if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or\n\n(c) is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.\n\n(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in item (7) is to ensure compliance with the terms of a boating citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.\n\n(9) In most instances, a person receiving a boating citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately to continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(10) The practice described in item (7) causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.\n\n(11) The enforcement practices described in item (7) consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\n(B) It is the policy of the party states to:\n\n(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to boating activities on public waters in their respective states.\n\n(2) Recognize the suspension of watercraft operating privileges or the watercraft operator's license of any person whose watercraft operating privileges or watercraft operator's license has been suspended by a party state and treat the suspension as if it had occurred in their state.\n\n(3) Allow violators to accept a boating citation, except as provided in subsection (B) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.\n\n(4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any boating conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state.\n\n(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat boating convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.\n\n(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a boating citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.\n\n(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.\n\n(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of boating violations.\n\n(C) The purposes of this compact are to:\n\n(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subsection (B) in a uniform and orderly manner.\n\n(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of boating violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.\n\nARTICLE II DefinitionsUnless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions in this article apply through this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact:\n\nARTICLE II Definitions\n\n(1) \"Boating activity\" means any activity
