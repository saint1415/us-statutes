An owner wishing to make a beneficial habitat claim must make the site's vegetation management plan available to the public and provide a copy of the plan to the department for review.\n\nThe department or another entity may issue a certificate of compliance to the owner of a solar site meeting the plan guidelines that the owner may use to promote its participation in the program.\n\nHISTORY: 2018 Act No. 253 (H.4875), Section 1, eff May 25, 2018.",
