      "text": "The General Assembly finds that: (1) a significant part of the state mission in education has been to enhance excellence in higher education for low-income and educationally disadvantaged students; (2) certain institutions have played an integral role in offering higher educational access to low-income and educationally disadvantaged students who otherwise might not have been able to obtain a college education, which has resulted in a substantial public benefit; (3) these institutions provide a unique educational opportunity for these targeted groups of students by offering flexible admission policies, low tuition rates, and small enrollments to ensure smaller class size tailored to the needs of these targeted students; (4) these institutions are often limited in their abilities to raise funds from their respective student populations from tuition and fees because of the demographic profiles of their students and, as a result, charge tuition rates which on average are substantially lower than those charged by other higher educational institutions in this State; (5) the federal government has recognized the unique ability of certain institutions to accomplish the important public benefit of enhancing opportunities in higher education for low-income and educationally disadvantaged students; (6) public educational assistance made available to the institutions that serve these targeted students provides a direct educational benefit to the students by improving the overall quality of their educational experiences by offering enhanced facilities and improved academic instruction; and (7) it is necessary that the State of South Carolina enable these institutions to effectively partner with the federal government to ensure the continued existence in this State of these institutions, which provide a substantial public benefit to the State by enabling these targeted students to be well-educated, to move into the workforce, and to improve the quality of life in South Carolina.

      "text": "(A) There is hereby established the South Carolina Higher Education Excellence Enhancement Program for the general purpose of enhancing the educational opportunities of low-income and educationally disadvantaged students. The program must be administered by the Commission on Higher Education. The commission must enter into annual contracts with eligible institutions to accomplish the purposes of this program. (B) The program must be funded by appropriations from the Education Lottery Account in an amount provided by the General Assembly. (C)(1) An institution seeking to qualify as an eligible institution must submit an annual application to the commission. The commission must certify the eligibility of institutions seeking contracts pursuant to this section. Subject to the provisions of item (2), and less any allocations made pursuant to item (2), the funds appropriated for this program must be allocated equally among the eligible institutions. (2) The Commission on Higher Education, or its successor, annually shall review and determine if funds allocated to a school pursuant to item (1) have been properly used by the school pursuant to Section 2-77-30. If the Commission on Higher Education, or its successor, determines these funds were used inappropriately by a school, the funds must be returned, and the following year that school's allocation must be reduced by fifty percent of the amount appropriated to each eligible institution pursuant to item (1). The balance remaining from a school's reduced allocation must be distributed equally among the remaining eligible institutions. (D) From the amounts allocated on an equal basis, an institution receiving an allocation of funds must first use the funds as the nonfederal match required by a federal funding program that provides funding for historic preservation or for capital improvements. In awarding funds based on merit, the commission shall give priority to those proposals that can be matched with funds from a federal funding program.
