      "text": "(A) A need exists for careful planning to expand local detention and correctional facilities to enable local governments adequately to incarcerate offenders who are awaiting trial or serving sentences of imprisonment at the local level. At the same time, South Carolina faces a critical need for more prison space to accommodate the projected increase in the inmate population. At a time when the state's prisons are becoming increasingly overcrowded, budgetary resources are becoming more limited and the future availability of capital improvement bonds for more prison construction is uncertain. (B) To ensure that adequate space is available in state corrections facilities for violent and habitual offenders, a need exists for additional community correctional facilities to enable courts to sentence nonviolent offenders to these less costly community correctional facilities which enable the offenders to make restitution payments and otherwise compensate the community for their crimes and which require participation in programs emphasizing substance abuse, education, and mental health counseling. (C) The need exists for South Carolina to create a plan from which the State can establish a partnership with local governments to meet the corrections and incarceration needs of local governments and the State by offering less costly facilities for housing state and local inmates in alternative sentencing programs.

      "text": "(A) Before construction of a community correctional facility by the Department of Corrections pursuant to Section 2-48-20, tracts of land suitable for the construction of community corrections facilities must be provided by the county, municipality, or other local governmental or multi-jurisdictional entity involved. The title of the lands provided must be conveyed to the State of South Carolina. Upon the acquisition of the land in the name of the State, the Department of Administration has the authority to convey the land to the Department of Corrections for the erection and construction of the facilities. The original construction costs and necessary equipment costs for the facilities must be paid by the State. These facilities must be constructed to the extent possible by utilizing inmate labor as determined appropriate by the Director of the Department of Corrections. When circumstances warrant, the Department of Corrections may contract for the construction of these facilities. Legal title to the facilities must be transferred to the State of South Carolina, as set forth in this chapter, and the facilities are the property of the Department of Corrections. (B) The Department of Corrections may contract with a county, municipality, or other local governmental or multi-jurisdictional entity to fund all or a portion of the construction costs associated with a community correctional facility if the appropriations are provided by the General Assembly. All other provisions of Chapter 48 and all other applicable statutes apply in respect to this contractual arrangement, except that the title to the land and the title to the facilities are not transferred to the State of South Carolina and neither the land nor the facilities shall become the property of the Department of Corrections.
