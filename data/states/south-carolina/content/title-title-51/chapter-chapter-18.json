Such areas and features are irreplaceable as laboratories for historic and cultural research and as living museums where people may observe and enjoy examples of the lands, structures, and related artifacts that represent significant parts of our historical and cultural heritage.\n\nA coordinated and concerted program is needed to insure the maximum conservation of these resources through the establishment of a more effective and adequate official legal mechanism for identifying, recognizing, and protecting such areas for their outstanding characteristics. While the preservation of all of these assets in their natural state is both impractical and often not necessarily in the total best interest of the State and the public, they exist in limited and decreasing quantities. The time is now for a decision to be made as to which of these areas and sites deserve increased protection and for selecting the most appropriate means for doing so.\n\nIt is, therefore, the public policy of this State to secure for the people, both present and future generations, the benefits of an enduring resource of historically significant cultural areas and features by establishing a system of War Between the States Heritage Preserves and Sites; protecting this system; gathering and disseminating information regarding it; establishing and maintaining a listing of War Between the States Heritage Preserves and Sites; and otherwise encouraging and assisting in the preservation of natural and cultural areas and features of this State.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 387, Part II, Section 52A, eff July 1, 2000.",
