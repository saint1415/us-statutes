      "text": "INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT\n\nThe Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\n(a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n\n(c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n\n(d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution.\n\n(e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined.\n\n1. Its duration.\n\n2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.\n\n3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom.\n\n4. Delivery and retaking of inmates.\n\n5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.\n\n(b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.\n\n(b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.\n\n(c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided, that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.\n\n(d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify the record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of such inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\n(e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which the inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n\n(f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. The record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.\n\n(g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\n(h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.\n\n(i) The parent, guardian, trustee or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.\n\n(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 55-672; 1971 (57) 793.",
