      "text": "As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) \"Administrative monitoring\" means a form of monitoring by the department beyond the end of the term of supervision in which the only remaining condition of supervision not completed is the payment of financial obligations. Under administrative monitoring, the only condition of the monitoring shall be the requirement that reasonable progress be made toward the payment of financial obligations. The payment of monitoring mandated fees shall continue. When an offender is placed on administrative monitoring, the offender shall register with the department's representative in the offender's county, notify the department of the offender's current address each quarter, and make payments on financial obligations owed, until the financial obligations are paid in full or a consent order of judgment is filed. Written notice of petitions for civil contempt as set forth in Section 24-21-100, scheduled hearings or proceedings, or any other event or modification associated with administrative monitoring must be given by the department by depositing the notice in the United States mail with postage prepaid addressed to the person at the address contained in the records of the department. The giving of notice by mail is complete ten days after the deposit of the notice. A certificate by the director of the department or the director's designee that the notice has been sent as required in this section is presumptive proof that the requirements as to notice of petitions for civil contempt as set forth in Section 24-21-100, scheduled hearings or proceedings, or any other event or modification associated with administrative monitoring have been met even if the notice has not been received by the offender. If an offender fails to appear for the civil contempt proceeding, the court may issue a bench warrant for the offender's arrest for failure to appear, or the court may proceed in the offender's absence and issue a bench warrant along with an order imposing a term of confinement as set forth in Section 24-21-100.\n\n(2) \"Criminal risk factors\" mean characteristics and behaviors that, when addressed or changed, affect a person's risk for committing crimes. The characteristics may include, but not be limited to, the following risk and criminogenic need factors: antisocial behavior patterns; criminal personality; antisocial attitudes, values, and beliefs; poor impulse control; criminal thinking; substance abuse; criminal associates; dysfunctional family or marital relationships; or low levels of employment or education.\n\n(3) \"Department\" means the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services.\n\n(4) \"Evidence-based practices\" mean supervision policies, procedures, and practices that scientific research demonstrates reduce recidivism among individuals on probation, parole, or post-correctional supervision.\n\n(5) \"Financial obligations\" mean fines, fees, and restitution either ordered by the court or statutorily imposed.\n\n(6) \"Hearing officer\" means an employee of the department who conducts preliminary hearings to determine probable cause on alleged violations committed by an individual under the supervision of the department and as otherwise provided by law. This includes, but is not limited to, violations concerning probation, parole, and community supervision. The hearing officer also conducts preliminary hearings and final revocation hearings for supervised furlough, youthful offender conditional release cases, and such other hearings as required by law.\n\nHISTORY: 2010 Act No. 273, Section 45, eff January 1, 2011; 2016 Act No. 154 (H.3545), Section 5, eff April 21, 2016.",

To qualify for appointment, the director must have a baccalaureate or more advanced degree from an institution of higher learning that has been accredited by a regional or national accrediting body, which is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and must have at least ten years of training and experience in one or more of the following fields: parole, probation, corrections, criminal justice, law, law enforcement, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, or social work.\n\n(B) The Board of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services is composed of seven members. The terms of office of the members are for six years. Each of the seven members must be appointed from each of the congressional districts. At least one appointee shall have at least five years of work or volunteer experience in one or more of the following fields: parole, probation, corrections, criminal justice, law, law enforcement, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, or social work. Vacancies must be filled by gubernatorial appointment with the advice and consent of the Senate for the unexpired term. If a vacancy occurs during a recess of the Senate, the Governor may fill the vacancy by appointment for the unexpired term pending the consent of the Senate, provided the appointment is received for confirmation on the first day of the Senate's next meeting following the vacancy. A chairman must be elected annually by a majority of the membership of the board. The chairman may serve consecutive terms.\n\n(C) The Governor shall deliver an appointment within sixty days of the expiration of a term, if an individual is being reappointed, or within ninety days of the expiration of a term, if an individual is an initial appointee. If a board member who is being reappointed is not confirmed within sixty days of receipt of the appointment by the Senate, the appointment is considered rejected. For an initial appointee, if confirmation is not made within ninety days of receipt of the appointment by the Senate, the appointment is deemed rejected. The Senate may by resolution extend the period after which an appointment is considered rejected. If the failure of the Senate to confirm an appointee would result in the lack of a quorum of board membership, the seat for which confirmation is denied or rejected shall not be considered when determining if a quorum of board membership exists.\n\n(D) Within ninety days of a parole board member's appointment by the Governor and confirmation by the Senate, the board member must complete a comprehensive training course developed by the department using training components consistent with those offered by the National Institute of Corrections or the American Probation and Parole Association. This training course must include classes regarding the following:\n\n(1) the elements of the decision making process, through the use of evidence-based practices for determining offender risk, needs and motivations to change, including the actuarial assessment tool that is used by the parole agent;\n\n(2) security classifications as established by the Department of Corrections;\n\n(3) programming and disciplinary processes and the department's supervision, case planning, and violation process;\n\n(4) the dynamics of criminal victimization; and\n\n(5) collaboration with corrections related stakeholders, both public and private, to increase offender success and public safety.\n\nThe department must promulgate regulations setting forth the minimum number of hours of training required for the board members and the specific requirements of the course that the members must complete.\n\n(E)(1) Each parole board member is also required to complete a minimum of eight hours of training annually, which shall be provided for in the department's annual budget. This annual training course must be developed using the training components consistent with those offered by the National Institute of Corrections or American Probation and Parole Association and must offer classes regarding:\n\n(a) a review and analysis of the effectiveness of the assessment tool used by the parole agents;\n\n(b) a review of the department's progress toward public safety goals;\n\n(c) the use of data in decision making; and\n\n(d) any information regarding promising and evidence-based practices offered in the corrections related and crime victim dynamics field.\n\nThe department must promulgate regulations setting forth the specific criteria for the course that the members must complete.\n\n(2) If a parole board member does not fulfill the training as provided in this section, the Governor, upon notification, must remove that member from the board unless the Governor grants the parole board member an extension to complete the training, based upon exceptional circumstances.\n\n(F) The department must develop a plan that includes the following:\n\n(1) establishment of a process for adopting a validated actuarial risk and needs assessment tool consistent with evidence-based practices and factors that contribute to criminal behavior, which the parole board shall use in making parole decisions, including additional objective criteria that may be used in parole decisions;\n\n(2) establishment of procedures for the department on the use of the validated assessment tool to guide the department, parole board, and agents of the department in determining supervision management and strategies for all offenders under the department's supervision, including offender risk classification, and case planning and treatment decisions to address criminal risk factors and reduce offender risk of recidivism; and\n\n(3) establishment of goals for the department, which include training requirements, mechanisms to ensure quality implementation of the validated assessment tool, and safety performance indicators.\n\n(G) The director shall submit the plan in writing to the Sentencing Reform Oversight Committee no later than July 1, 2011. Thereafter, the department must submit an annual report to the Sentencing Reform Oversight Committee on its performance for the previous fiscal year and plans for the upcoming year. The department must collect and report all relevant data in a uniform format of both board decisions and field services and must annually compile a summary of past practices and outcomes.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 55-551; 1952 Code Section 55-551; 1942 Code Section 1038-5; 1942 (42) 1456, 1463; 1946 (44) 1516; 1976 Act No. 509, Section 1; 1981 Act No. 100, Sections 1-3; 1988 Act No. 480, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 4; 1995 Act No. 7, Part I, Section 38; 2010 Act No. 273, Section 46, eff January 1, 2011; 2012 Act No. 223, Section 1, eff June 7, 2012; 2012 Act No. 279, Section 8, eff June 26, 2012.",

Inmates who have been incarcerated for a minimum of two years shall be released to reentry supervision one hundred eighty days before their release date. For an inmate whose sentence includes probation, the period of reentry supervision is reduced by the term of probation.\n\n(C) The individual terms and conditions of reentry supervision shall be developed by the department using an evidence-based assessment of the inmate's needs and risks. An inmate placed on reentry supervision must be supervised by a probation agent of the department. The department shall promulgate regulations for the terms and conditions of reentry supervision. Until such time as regulations are promulgated, the terms and conditions shall be based on guidelines developed by the director. However, if, under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, the multidisciplinary team finds probable cause to believe that an inmate is a sexually violent predator pursuant to Section 44-48-50, then the inmate is not eligible for the supervised reentry program until the resolution of the proceedings pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act.\n\n(D) If the department determines that an inmate has violated a term or condition of reentry supervision sufficient to revoke the reentry supervision, a probation agent must initiate a proceeding before a department administrative hearing officer. The proceeding must be initiated pursuant to a warrant or a citation describing the violations of the reentry supervision. No inmate arrested for violation of a term or condition of reentry supervision may be released on bond; however, he shall be credited with time served as set forth in Section 24-13-40 toward his release date. If the administrative hearing officer determines the inmate has violated a term or condition of reentry supervision, the hearing officer may impose other terms or conditions set forth in the regulations or department guidelines, and may continue the inmate on reentry supervision, or the hearing officer may revoke the inmate's reentry supervision and the inmate shall be incarcerated up to one hundred eighty days, but the maximum aggregate time that the inmate shall serve on reentry supervision or for revocation of the reentry supervision shall not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of incarceration imposed by the court for the offense that the inmate was serving at the time of his initial reentry supervision. The decision of the administrative hearing officer on the reentry supervision shall be final and there shall be no appeal of his decision.\n\nHISTORY: 2010 Act No. 273, Section 48, eff January 1, 2011; 2023 Act No. 19 (S.146), Section 14, eff May 16, 2023.",

If the individual under administrative monitoring fails to make reasonable progress toward the payment of such financial obligations, as determined by the department, the department may petition the court to hold an individual in civil contempt for failure to pay the financial obligations.

Following any term of confinement, the individual shall be returned to quarterly administrative monitoring by the department. If the individual under administrative monitoring does not have the ability to pay the financial obligations and has no reasonable likelihood of being able to pay in the future, the department may submit a consent order of judgment to the court, which shall relieve the individual of any further administrative monitoring.\n\n(B) An individual placed on administrative monitoring shall pay a regular monitoring fee toward offsetting the cost of his administrative monitoring for the period of time that he remains under monitoring.

Immediate notice of suspension must be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice of the State, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state commissions. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform the obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact must be terminated from the effective date of suspension.\n\n(2) Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state commissioners of the termination.\n\n(3) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(4) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(5) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\n(C) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and by-laws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n(D)(1) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\n(2) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission must be wound up, and any surplus funds must be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nHISTORY: 2002 Act No. 273, Section 1.",
