(B) Wrist restraints may be used during any internal escort or external transport. The wrist restraints only shall be applied in the front and in a way that the pregnant inmate may be able to protect herself and the fetus in the event of a fall. This provision also applies to inmates not in labor or suspected labor who are escorted out for Ultrasound Addiction Therapy for Pregnant Women or other routine services. The director of the facility must be notified anytime an inmate is transported externally for delivery. (C) The following inmates must not be placed in any restraints, including wrist restraints, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate presents an immediate, serious threat of hurting herself, staff, or others, including her fetus or child, or that she presents an immediate, credible risk of escape that cannot be reasonably contained through other methods: (1) an inmate who is in labor, which is defined as occurring at the onset of contractions; (2) an inmate who is delivering her baby; (3) an inmate who is identified by medical staff as in postpartum recuperation; (4) an inmate who is transported or housed in an outside medical facility for treating labor and delivery; (5) an inmate for induction once the intravenous line has been placed and the induction medication has been started; (6) an inmate who is being transported from the holding room to the operating room for C-section; or (7) an inmate during initial bonding with a newborn child, including nursing and skin-to-skin contact. If restraints are required, they should allow for the mother's safe handling of her infant. (D) When the use of restraints during labor occurs, officers must immediately notify the director of the facility of the reasons why restraints were applied and an incident report must be completed. (E) Upon medical discharge, wrist restraints must be applied for transport back to the facility. Leg restraints may be applied when there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate presents an immediate, serious threat of hurting herself, staff, or others, or that she presents an immediate, credible risk of escape that cannot be reasonably contained through other methods. (F) Waist restraints shall not be used at any time during pregnancy or postdelivery, to include transport back to the facility. (G) If a state correctional facility, local detention facility, prison camp or work camp, or the employees of these facilities are unaware that an inmate is either pregnant or has been clinically diagnosed as pregnant, then neither the facility nor its employees are legally liable or responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the inmate under this section. (H) Correctional facility, local detention facility, and prison or work camp employees, other than certified healthcare professionals, must not conduct invasive body cavity searches of known pregnant inmates unless there is a reasonable belief the inmate is concealing contraband. (I) Correctional facilities, local detention facilities, and prison or work camps must ensure known pregnant inmates are provided sufficient food and dietary supplements as ordered by a physician, physician staff member, or a facility nutritionist to meet generally accepted prenatal nutritional guidelines. (J) Correctional facilities, local detention facilities, and prison or work camps must not place a known pregnant inmate, or any female inmate who has given birth within the previous thirty days, in restrictive housing unless there is a reasonable belief the inmate will harm herself, the fetus, or another person, or pose a substantial flight risk. This subsection does not apply if protective custody is requested by a known pregnant inmate or any female inmate who has given birth within the previous thirty days. (K) Correctional facilities, local detention facilities, and prison or work camps must not assign a known pregnant inmate to any bed that is elevated more than three feet from the facility's floor. (L) Correctional facilities, local detention facilities, and prison or work camps must ensure that sufficient menstrual hygiene products are available at each facility for all women under their care who have an active menstrual cycle. Indigent inmates must be provided the hygiene products at no cost. (M) Correctional facilities, local detention facilities, and prison or work camps must limit, when practical, bodily inspections of a female inmate by male officers when the female inmate is naked or only partially clothed. (N) To the extent practicable, the Department of Corrections must authorize minor dependents to visit inmates with low or minimum-security classifications at least once per week, and authorize contact visits for these inmates with the minor dependents.

(4) \"Administrator\" means the county administrator, city administrator, or the chief administrative officer of a county or municipality. (5) \"Director\" means the agency head of the Department of Corrections. (B) The administrator or director, whichever is appropriate, may establish, by rules, criteria for a reasonable deduction from money credited to the account of an inmate to: (1) repay the costs of: (a) public property wilfully damaged or destroyed by the inmate during his incarceration; (b) medical treatment for injuries inflicted by the inmate upon himself or others; (c) searching for and apprehending the inmate when he escapes or attempts to escape. The costs must be limited to those extraordinary costs incurred as a consequence of the escape; or (d) quelling a riot or other disturbance in which the inmate is unlawfully involved; (2) defray the costs paid by a municipality or county for medical services for an inmate, which have been requested by the inmate, if the deduction does not exceed five dollars for each occurrence of treatment received by the inmate. If the balance in an inmate's account is less than ten dollars, the fee must not be charged. However, a deficiency balance must be carried forward and, upon a deposit or credit being made to the inmate's account, any outstanding balance may be deducted from the account. This deficiency balance may be carried forward after release of the inmate and may be applied to the inmate's account in the event of subsequent arrests and incarcerations. This item does not apply to medical costs incurred as a result of injuries sustained by an inmate or other medically necessary treatment for which that inmate is determined not to be responsible. (C) All sums collected for medical treatment must be reimbursed to the inmate, upon the inmate's request, if the inmate is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all charges for which the inmate was being held. (D) The detention facility may initiate an action for collection of recovery of medical costs incurred pursuant to this section against an inmate upon his release or his estate if the inmate was executed or died while in the custody of the detention facility.

The conditions for participation must include the requirement that the offender must permit the search or seizure, without a search warrant, with or without cause, of the offender's person, any vehicle the offender owns or is driving, and any of the offender's possessions by: (1) any probation agent employed by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services; or (2) any other law enforcement officer. However, the conditions for participation for an offender who was convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a Class C misdemeanor or an unclassified misdemeanor that carries a term of imprisonment of not more than one year may not include the requirement that the offender agree to be subject to search or seizure, without a search warrant, with or without cause, of the offender's person, any vehicle the offender owns or is driving, or any of the offender's possessions. By enacting this provision, the General Assembly intends to provide law enforcement with a means of reducing recidivism and does not authorize law enforcement officers to conduct searches for the sole purpose of harassment. Immediately before each search or seizure conducted pursuant to this section, the law enforcement officer seeking to conduct the search or seizure must verify with the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services or by any other means available to the officer that the individual upon whom the search or seizure will be conducted is currently on supervised furlough. A law enforcement officer conducting a search or seizure without a warrant pursuant to this section shall report to the law enforcement agency that employs him all of these searches or seizures, which shall include the name, address, age, gender, and race or ethnicity of the person that is the subject of the search or seizure. The law enforcement agency shall submit this information at the end of each month to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for review of abuse. A finding of abuse of the use of searches or seizures without a search warrant must be reported by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services to the State Law Enforcement Division for investigation. If the law enforcement officer fails to report each search or seizure pursuant to this section, he is subject to discipline pursuant to the employing agency's policies and procedures. The cooperative agreement between the two departments shall specify the responsibilities and authority for implementing and operating the program. Inmates approved and placed on the program must be under the supervision of agents of the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services who are responsible for ensuring the inmate's compliance with the rules, regulations, and conditions of the program as well as monitoring the inmate's employment and participation in any of the prescribed and authorized community-based correctional programs such as vocational rehabilitation, technical education, and alcohol/drug treatment. Eligibility criteria for the program include, but are not limited to, all of the following requirements: (1) maintain a clear disciplinary record for at least six months prior to consideration for placement on the program; (2) demonstrate to Department of Corrections' officials a general desire to become a law-abiding member of society; (3) satisfy any other reasonable requirements imposed upon him by the Department of Corrections; (4) have an identifiable need for and willingness to participate in authorized community-based programs and rehabilitative services; (5) have been committed to the State Department of Corrections with a total sentence of five years or less as the first or second adult commitment for a criminal offense for which the inmate received a sentence of one year or more. The Department of Corrections shall notify victims pursuant to Article 15, Chapter 3, Title 16 as well as the sheriff's office of the place to be released before releasing inmates through any supervised furlough program. These requirements do not apply to the crimes referred to in this section.
