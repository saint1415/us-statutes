However, if the director determines that the public interest is served by permitting the facility to remain open, he may stipulate actions to avoid or delay closing the facility. The governing body and the resident or presiding judge of the judicial circuit shall be notified by certified mail of the director's order closing a local confinement facility.\n\n(C) The governing body has the right to appeal the director's order to the resident or presiding judge of the circuit in which the facility is located.

The hearing must be conducted without a jury in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Circuit Court. The Department of Corrections, the governing body concerned, other responsible local officials, and fire and health inspection personnel have a right to be present at the hearing and present evidence which the court deems appropriate to determine whether the local confinement facility met the required minimum standards, or appropriate fire and health codes and regulations, or both, on the date of the last inspection.
