To obtain the name and address of the lienholders, the tax collector shall either: (a) forward to the department a form provided below requesting the name and address of all lienholders shown on the certificate of title or (b) obtain from official department records the names and addresses of all lienholders shown on the certificate of title, to include the information listed on the form below.

If a lienholder's most current collateral list, including any supplement, fails to disclose to the tax collector the lienholder's lien on a home that is to be sold, the lienholder is not entitled to notice pursuant to this subsection.

Except to the extent that they are entitled to receive notice pursuant to subsections (B) or (C) and (D)(1), the only notice the newly identified lienholders, or known lienholders at a newly identified address, are entitled to receive pursuant to this subitem is a notice of their right of redemption pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 51, Title 12.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 386, Section 49.A, eff June 14, 2006; 2015 Act No. 87 (S.379), Section 53, eff June 11, 2015.",
