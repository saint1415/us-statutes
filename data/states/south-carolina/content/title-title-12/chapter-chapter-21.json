      "text": "(A) Each person or distributor of cigarettes taxable under this article, first receiving untaxed cigarettes for sale or distribution in this State, is subject to the tax imposed in Section 12-21-620. The taxes imposed on cigarettes pursuant to this chapter must be paid by affixing stamps in the manner and at the time provided in this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, stamps must be affixed to each individual package of cigarettes by distributors before being sold, distributed, or shipped to another person. A distributor may affix stamps only to packages of cigarettes obtained directly from a manufacturer or importer with a valid permit issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 5713. If cigarettes are manufactured in this State and sold directly to consumers in this State by a manufacturer or importer, the cigarette packages must be stamped by a licensed distributor before being sold.\n\n(B) Only manufacturers or importers with a valid permit issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 5713, or licensed distributors, may receive or possess unstamped packages of cigarettes. Only a manufacturer or importer with a valid permit issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 5713 may ship or otherwise cause to be delivered unstamped packages of cigarettes in, into, or from this State, except that a licensed distributor may transfer, transport, or cause to be transported unstamped cigarettes from a facility owned by the distributor to another facility, wherever located, owned by the distributor.\n\n(C) A qualified distributor licensed pursuant to this chapter may sell cigarettes without South Carolina stamps affixed to the package, provided that:\n\n(1) the cigarettes are set forth in separate stock for sale to a licensed distributor of cigarettes in another state;\n\n(2) if the cigarettes are not in the possession of a qualified distributor licensed pursuant to this chapter, the cigarettes must be in the possession of a person having immediate evidence of a license in business as a distributor of cigarettes in the another state, and the cigarettes must be purchased for the purpose of resale in the other state;\n\n(3) the cigarettes, at the time of sale by the distributor, properly are stamped with revenue stamps authorized and issued by another state for use on the cigarettes, if the other state requires revenue stamps, or any applicable tax imposed on the cigarettes by the other state has been paid if the law of the other state permits the sale of the cigarettes to consumers in a package not bearing a stamp; and\n\n(4) at all times there is accompanying the cigarettes an invoice, indicating the purchase date, the name, address, and telephone number of the seller, and the name, address, and telephone number of the purchaser. A distributor shall have on file a record of each sale, the original purchase order, a copy of the invoice, and a signed receipt from the purchaser showing that the purchase was made exclusively for resale in another state.\n\n(D) Cigarettes may be sold by qualified distributors without revenue stamps affixed to the package when exempted from tax by Section 12-21-100. A distributor that receives or possesses cigarettes intended for sale or distribution into or within this State which are exempt from the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter shall affix stamps that indicate the package of cigarettes is exempt from tax.\n\n(E) The department shall prescribe, prepare, and furnish stamps of denominations and quantities as necessary for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter. The department also shall cause to be prepared and distributed to licensed distributors stamps that indicate that a package of cigarettes is exempt from the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(1) The stamps must be of a type that when affixed on each individual package the stamps cannot be removed without being mutilated or destroyed.\n\n(2) The department, by rules and regulations, shall designate the type of stamps to be applied.\n\n(3) The stamps must be sold only in amounts of thirty thousand or multiples of thirty thousand.\n\n(4) In addition to stamps, the department, by rules and regulations, may authorize licensed distributors to use other devices which imprint distinctive indicia evidencing the payment of the tax upon each individual package. The machines must be constructed in a manner as accurately records or meters the number of impressions or tax stamps made. The tax meter machines or other devices must be kept available at all reasonable times for inspection by the department.\n\n(5) The department, by rules and regulations, may authorize a process allowing for a credit for damaged tax stamps, for product returned as unsellable, and for product unrecoverable as a result of bad debt.\n\n(6) A distributor is allowed a tax credit for the purchase of one stamping machine and equipment acquired by the distributor within one year of implementation by the department. The credit may be claimed beginning in the first calendar month following the purchase of the machine and equipment and continuing for the immediately succeeding seventeen months. The amount of the credit equals the direct costs actually incurred by the distributor to acquire the stamping machine and equipment, as determined by the department, divided by eighteen, with the maximum cumulative credit equaling one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars. The direct costs must exclude costs for shipping, installation, or for ongoing maintenance related to the machine. Any tax credit must be applied only to the tax remitted pursuant to this chapter. The department may promulgate regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this credit.\n\n(7) The department, by rules and regulations, may authorize the sale of stamps to a distributor on thirty-day credit periods. Those persons authorized to pay tax by such means are required to execute a bond with a solvent surety company qualified to do business in this State, in an amount of one hundred ten percent of the distributor's estimated tax liability for thirty days, but not less than two thousand dollars, and conditioned upon the distributor paying all taxes due the State arising from this section. This form of payment is in lieu of cash or its equivalent. Payment for each month's liability is due on or before the twentieth day of each month, including Sundays and holidays. At the discretion of the department, default in the bonding and payment provisions by any distributor may result in the revocation of the distributor's privilege to purchase stamps.\n\n(F) All stamps prescribed by the department must be designed and furnished in a fashion that permits identification of the distributor that affixed the stamp to the particular package of cigarettes by means of a serial number or other mark on the stamp. A stamp on a package of cigarettes must note whether the taxes prescribed in this chapter were paid or whether the package of cigarettes was exempt from the taxes.\n\n(G) Stamps only may be affixed to packages of cigarettes that are listed on the South Carolina Tobacco Directory published by the Office of the Attorney General pursuant to Section 11-48-30.\n\n(H) The department may appoint manufacturers and distributors of cigarettes, in or out of this State, as agents to buy or affix stamps to be used in paying the tax imposed by this chapter, but the agent at all times has the right to appoint a person in his employ who is to affix the stamps to any cigarette under the agent's control.\n\n(1) When the department sells and delivers to an agent, the agent is entitled to receive as compensation for his services and expenses as an agent in affixing and accounting for the taxes represented by the stamps and to retain out of the money to be paid by the agent for the stamps a discount of four and twenty-five one hundredths percent of the face value of the stamps.\n\n(2) The department, by rules and regulations, shall provide a method of purchasing stamps.\n\n(I) The department may promulgate regulations necessary to enforce this section.\n\n(J) For the limited purpose of recovering the costs incurred by the department associated with the installation and operation of the cigarette stamp program, annually the department may retain up to four hundred thousand dollars of tax revenue generated pursuant to Section 12-21-620(A)(1), not to exceed actual costs. By March fifteenth of each year, the department must report to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee the costs incurred by the department associated with the operation of the cigarette tax stamp program.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 114, Section 1; 1996 Act No. 239, Section 3; 2016 Act No. 145 (H.4151), Section 1, eff March 14, 2016 and January 1, 2019.",

Each player must pay face value for each card to be played during the course of a game and may purchase the card for a specified number of games. All cards sold for a game must sell for face value and cards may not be given to players as prizes or for free. After the player has purchased a card or cards for a specified number of games, the house cannot require or accept an additional payment or consideration by the player in order to complete the specified number of games.\n\n(2) Before each game begins, the caller shall announce to the players the configuration or configurations that will win the game. A configuration consists of a number of grids covered in the manner announced by the caller. Any method of playing the games is allowed if the method is announced before each game's beginning including, but not limited to, wild card games. In addition, anytime before the conclusion of the game, the prize, specifically stating the dollar amount or value of merchandise awarded to the winner or winners for the game, must be announced.\n\n(3) The prize must be awarded to the winner of that game without delay. For multiple winners, the prize must be divided equally among the winners. In the case of a merchandise prize, the cash value of the merchandise may be divided among the winners. Purchase receipts of merchandise awarded as prizes must be made available to players and the department for confirmation of value.\n\n(4) The caller shall draw and announce numbers from the cage one at a time. If a player has a card with the called number on it, he may use a marker to cover the square which contains the number. After the number is announced, it must be indicated on the master-board by the caller.\n\n(5) When a player covers sufficient squares on a card to achieve the winning configuration, he may indicate to the caller. The caller shall require that the player's card be checked against the master-board in the presence of the other players to determine if the squares were covered accurately. If it is determined by the caller that the player accurately has covered the squares and achieved the preannounced configuration, the player is declared the winner. If it is determined that the player has not covered the squares accurately and achieved the preannounced configuration, play continues in that game.\n\n(6) All devices, including the master-board, used to show what numbers have been called during a game must not be intentionally changed, obstructed, or turned off by the promoter until the winners are verified.\n\nHISTORY: 1996 Act No. 449, Section 1; 2002 Act No. 334, Section 16C, eff October 1, 2002; 2004 Act No. 172, Section 4, eff August 2, 2003; 2016 Act No. 254 (H.5034), Section 3, eff June 7, 2016.",

All winning configurations must be verified using an electronic verifying system and must be displayed on the monitor for all players to see.\n\n(9) Balls must be selected randomly by an indiscriminate process.\n\n(10) Only one number may be called at a time.\n\n(11) All balls drawn remain on the master-board until the conclusion of the game.\n\n(12)(a) At least fifty percent of the gross proceeds of the sale of bingo cards taken in by the house during a single session must be returned to the players in the form of prizes.

Amounts in excess of this limit are subject to a tax, in addition to any other bingo license taxes and fees equal to the amount of the excess. Each session that the gross proceeds are greater than twice the prize amounts paid constitutes a separate offense if the tax is unpaid. This excess proceeds tax must be remitted to the department on the organization's quarterly bingo report and distributed as provided in Section 12-21-4190. Failure to remit this excess proceeds tax to the department shall result in immediate suspension of both the promoter's license and the organization's license.

This amount is not to be paid out of the bingo account and is not included in total payouts for a session. There is no additional charge to players to participate in a special promotion.
