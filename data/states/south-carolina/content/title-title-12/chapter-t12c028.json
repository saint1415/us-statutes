The claim must be made directly to the department under regulations and procedures and on forms provided by the department. The department shall issue a refund within thirty days of receipt of the claim for refund from the licensed fuel vendor; (2) if the department makes a finding that its collections would not be jeopardized by application by an ultimate vendor for a Government Exempt Bulk Sales Permit which entitles that person to make purchases of fuel user fee-free for resale for exempt government use under the following conditions: (a) The vendor shall make application with the department for the permit on a form acceptable to the department. The application must include: (i) proof of financial responsibility or bond in an amount not to exceed the user fee on the total gallons to be purchased user fee-exempt in any year; (ii) an estimate of total user fee-exempt gallons to be sold under the permit on an annual basis, which amount constitutes the limit of user fee-exempt purchases which the applicant is authorized to make, absent re-application pursuant to subitem (f) of this item; (iii) the name of the suppliers from which the applicant shall make the user fee-exempt purchases under this permit for the term covered by the permit. This subitem does not mandate sales by a supplier to another person; (iv) a list of government user fee-exempt purchasers qualifying under subsubitem (c) of this subitem and estimated volumes for them; (v) other information the department reasonably requires. (b) Upon evaluation of the data provided by applicant and independent investigation of that information the department in its discretion makes, the department shall issue the permit provided under this section to the applicant with a copy to each supplier named by the applicant pursuant to subitem (a) of this item. (c) In order for a government entity to qualify as a government user fee-exempt purchaser eligible for user fee-exempt sales under this section, the ultimate vendor shall obtain a properly completed Federal Form 1094, its state equivalent, or successor form from the government entity and shall send to the department a copy of this form with an estimate of the annual quantity of motor fuel subject to the user fee to be supplied to that government entity purchaser. The department shall assign an approval number for that government entity and location and shall issue a permit to the ultimate vendor authorizing the ultimate vendor to make user fee-exempt sales of that estimated quantity of fuel to the agency. (d) The department may not require that the identical gallons purchased by the ultimate vendor under the permit be delivered to the eligible government entity, only that the total gallons purchased under the permit user fee exempt equal the total gallons delivered to all eligible government entities. (e) If the ultimate vendor fails to deliver any quantity of the user fee-exempt purchases to eligible government entities, the ultimate vendor is liable for the user fee on that quantity. If the excess of user fee-exempt gallons purchased exceeds gallons sold for user fee-exempt use by ten percent, the department in its discretion may levy a penalty equal to ten percent of the user fee due in addition to user fees due. (f) If the ultimate vendor needs to purchase additional gallons above that estimated to fulfill his commitments, he shall notify the department. If the department is satisfied with the reports submitted accounting for the user fee-exempt fuel previously submitted, it shall increase the quantity authorized on the permit and so notify the supplier. (3) If the sale to the eligible government entities of motor fuel subject to the user fee occur at a fixed retail pump available to the general public by: (a) application by the ultimate vendor, having made the sale to the eligible government entity without the user fee, for a refund from the department by submitting the application and supporting documentation the department reasonably prescribes by regulation; (b) by application for a refund, if the purchase is charged to a credit card issued to an eligible government entity, the issuer of the card elects to be the ultimate vendor, and the federal agency is billed without the user fee; (c) if the sale to the government entity includes the user fee levied by this chapter, by application for a refund by the government entity from the department including submitting such supporting documentation the department reasonably prescribes by regulation.

All balances in the fund must be carried forward annually so that no part of it reverts to any other fund. (B) The fund must be apportioned based upon the number of registered boats or other watercraft in each county and expended by the department to acquire, create, or improve water recreational resources. As used in this section, \"water recreational resources\" means public waters which are naturally occurring or which provide habitat for fish, aquatic animals, or waterfowl and which must provide public recreational opportunities. These funds may be used to promote activities that take place on the water for recreation provided that no more than ten percent of each annual allocation may be used for this purpose beginning July 1, 2003. (C) Each county delegation may make recommendations to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources for projects to acquire, create, or improve water recreational resources. The department must give these recommendations primary consideration over any other projects. (D) The Department of Natural Resources may use up to one-third of the funds for law enforcement, noxious aquatic weed control, and acquisition. The department must be reimbursed for design and engineering costs and administration of this section from the funds collected under the provisions of this section. (E) Any revenue collected or any funds remaining in the Water Recreational Resources Fund created by Act 1134 of 1968, must be transferred to the fund created by this act.

(G) The department must dispose of all surplus property owned by the department or subject to its custody and control for purposes of disposal in the manner provided by law for the disposition of surplus state property. Notwithstanding another provision of law or policy, it is unlawful for retired employees of the department to purchase surplus property directly from the department. It is not unlawful for retired employees to purchase surplus property that is disposed of according to law and sold at public auction.

      "text": "(A) The proceeds from two and sixty-six one-hundredths cents a gallon of the user fee on gasoline only as levied and provided for in this chapter must be deposited with the State Treasurer and expended for purposes set forth in this section. The monies must be apportioned among the counties of the State in the following manner: (1) one-third distributed in the ratio which the land area of the county bears to the total land area of the State; (2) one-third distributed in the ratio which the population of the county bears to the total population of the State as shown by the latest official decennial census; (3) one-third distributed in the ratio which the mileage of all rural roads in the county bears to the total rural road mileage in the State as shown by the latest official records of the Department of Transportation. The Department of Revenue shall collect the information required pursuant to Section 12-28-1390 regarding the number of gallons sold in each county for use in making allocations of donor funds as provided in subsection (H). The Department of Revenue shall submit the percentage of the total represented by each county to the Department of Transportation and to each county transportation committee annually by May first of the following calendar year. Upon request of a county transportation committee, the Department of Transportation shall continue to administer the funds allocated to the county. All interest earnings on the County Transportation Fund in the State Treasury must be added to the distribution to counties under this section in proportion to each county's portion of the entire County Transportation Fund. Except for those funds being used in connection with highway projects administered by the Department of Transportation on behalf of counties administering their own \"C\" funds, these distributions of earnings and the calculation required to determine the appropriate amount shall not include those counties administering their own \"C\" funds. (B) The funds expended must be approved by and used in furtherance of a countywide transportation plan adopted by a county transportation committee. The county transportation committee must be appointed by the county legislative delegation and must be made up of fair representation from municipalities and unincorporated areas of the county. County transportation committees may join in approving a regional transportation plan, and the funds must be used in furtherance of the regional transportation plan. This subsection does not prohibit the county legislative delegation from making project recommendations to the county transportation committee. A county transportation committee may expend from the funds allocated under this section an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars for reasonable administrative expenses directly related to the activities of the committee. Administrative expenses may include costs associated with copying, mailings, public notices, correspondence, and recordkeeping but do not include the payment of per diem or salaries for members of the committee. (C) At least twenty-five percent of a county's apportionment of \"C\" funds, based on a biennial averaging of expenditures, must be expended on the state highway system for construction, improvements, and maintenance. The Department of Transportation shall administer all funds expended on the state highway system unless the department has given explicit authority to a county or municipal government or other agent acting on behalf of the county transportation committee to design, engineer, construct, and inspect projects using their own personnel. The county transportation committee, at its discretion, may expend up to seventy-five percent of \"C\" construction funds for activities including other local paving or improving county roads, for street and traffic signs, and for other road and bridge projects. (D) The funds allocated to the county also may be used to issue county bonds or state highway bonds as provided in subsection (J), pay directly for appropriate highway projects, including engineering, contracting, and project supervision, and match federal funds available for appropriate projects. Beginning July 1, 2002, for any new \"C\" fund allocations received on or after this date, the balance of uncommitted funds carried forward from one year into the next may not exceed three hundred percent of the county's total apportionment for the most recent year. Expenditures must be documented on a per-project basis upon the completion of each project in reports to the respective county transportation committees. This documentation must be provided by the agency or local government actually expending the funds and it shall include a description of the completed project and a general accounting of all expenditures made in connection with the project summaries of these reports then must be forwarded by each county transportation committee to the department using guidelines established by the department and the department shall compile these reports into an annual statewide report to be submitted to the General Assembly by the second Tuesday of January of each year. The documentation and reporting requirements of this subsection apply only to counties administering their own \"C\" funds. For purposes of this section, \"uncommitted funds\" means funds held in the county's \"C\" fund account that have not been designated for specific projects. (E) All unexpended \"C\" funds allocated to a county remain in the account allocated to the county for the succeeding fiscal year and must be expended as provided in this section. (F) The countywide and regional transportation plans provided for in this section must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Transportation. Before the expenditure of funds by a county transportation committee, the committee shall adopt specifications for local road projects. In counties electing to expend their allocation directly pursuant to subsection (A), specifications of roads built with \"C\" funds are to be established by the countywide or regional transportation committee. In counties in which the county transportation committee elects to have \"C\" funds administered by the Department of Transportation, primary and secondary roads built using \"C\" funds must meet Department of Transportation specifications. (G) This section must not be construed as affecting the plans and implementation of plans for a Statewide Surface Transportation System as developed by the Department of Transportation. (H)(1) For purposes of this subsection, \"donor county\" means a county that contributes to the \"C\" fund an amount in excess of what it receives under the allocation formula as stated in subsection (A). In addition to the allocation to the counties pursuant to subsection (A), the Department of Transportation annually shall transfer to the donor counties an amount equal to seventeen million dollars in the ratio of the individual donor county's contribution in excess of \"C\" fund revenue allocated to the county under subsection (A) to the total excess contributions of all donor counties. (2) A county is eligible for an additional allocation from the Department of Transportation if the county contributed to the \"C\" fund an amount in excess of what it receives under the allocation formula as stated in subsection (A) plus what it receives under item (1). The Department of Transportation annually shall transfer to the eligible counties an amount up to three and one-half million dollars in the ratio of the individual eligible county's contribution to the \"C\" fund in excess of the eligible county's total allocations under subsection (A) and item (1) to the total excess contributions of all eligible counties remaining after all allocations under subsection (A) and item (1) have been made. Under no circumstances can an allocation under this item result in an eligible county receiving total allocations in excess of what the county contributed to the \"C\" fund. (I)(1) In expending funds pursuant to this section, counties that administer their own \"C\" funds shall use a procurement system that requires competitive sealed bids, no bid preferences not required by state or federal law, and public advertisement of all projects. All bids for contracts in excess of one hundred thousand dollars must be accompanied by certified bid bonds, and all work awarded under the contracts must be covered by performance and payment bonds for one hundred percent of the contract value. Bid summaries must be published in a newspaper of general distribution following each award. (2) The requirement of a bond for bid security or a bond for payment and performance may not include the requirement that the surety bond be furnished by a particular surety company or through a particular agent or broker. (J) State highway bonds may be issued for the completion of projects for which \"C\" funds may be expended for projects as determined by the county transportation committee. The applicable source for payment of principal and interest on the bonds is the share of \"C\" fund revenues available for use by the county transportation committee. The application for the bonds must be filed by the county transportation committee with the Commission of the Department of Transportation and the State Treasurer, which shall forward the application to the State Fiscal Accountability Authority. The State Fiscal Accountability Authority shall consider the application in the same manner that it considers state highway bonds, mutatis mutandis. (K) Members of the committee are insulated from all personal liability arising out of matters related directly to and within the scope of the performance of official duties and functions conferred upon the committee pursuant to this section. (L) In Berkeley County, appointments made pursuant to this section are governed by the provisions of Act 159 of 1995. (M) In Dorchester County, appointments made pursuant to this section are governed by the provisions of Act 512 of 1996. In addition to the members and appointment procedures of the Dorchester County Transportation Committee as provided by this section and subsection, two additional members of the county transportation committee must be appointed from that portion of the Town of Summerville in Dorchester County and that portion of the City of North Charleston in Dorchester County. These members must be residents of the designated municipalities and of the county, and notwithstanding another provision of this subsection, must be appointed by the governing body of the respective municipality. (N) In Georgetown County, appointments made pursuant to this section are governed by the provisions of Act 515 of 1996 and Section 2, Act 141 of 2001. (O) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the legislative delegation of a county may by delegation resolution abolish the county transportation committee and devolve its powers and duties on the governing body of the county. This devolution may be reversed and the county transportation committee reestablished by a subsequent delegation resolution. The exercise of county transportation committee powers and duties by a county governing body is not deemed to constitute dual office holding. (P) The Department of Transportation shall perform reviews to ensure compliance with subsections (C), (D), (F), and (I). A county failing to comply with these subsections must have all subsequent \"C\" fund allocations withheld until the requirements of those subsections are met. If a county fails to comply with those subsections within twenty-four months, the county forfeits fifty percent of its allocations for the following year and the forfeited amount must be divided among the other counties as provided in subsection (A). (Q) A county subject to a proposed withholding or forfeiture of \"C\" fund allocations pursuant to this section must be notified in writing of the department's decision. The county, within sixty days of receipt of notice of the decision, may request a review of the decision by a panel consisting of the state highway engineer or his designee, the chairman of the affected county's transportation committee or his designee, and a third person named by mutual agreement between the state highway engineer and the county transportation committee chairman. The panel shall meet and render a decision within ninety days of the request by the county transportation committee. The decision of the panel may be appealed by requesting a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court pursuant to Section 1-23-600 and the rules of procedure for the Administrative Law Court. The request for a hearing must be made within thirty days of receipt of the panel's decision. (R) The legislative delegation of the county, by resolution, may rename the county transportation committee established by this section as the (insert name of county) Legislative Delegation transportation committee. Upon the adoption of such a resolution, all references in this section and any other provisions of law to the county transportation committee, for purposes of that county, are deemed references to that county's legislative delegation transportation committee. (S) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A), on July 1, 2018, and each July first thereafter until after July 1, 2021, the amount of proceeds of the user fee on gasoline only as levied for in this chapter that must be deposited with the State Treasurer and expended for the purposes of this section must be increased by .3325 cents a gallon, until such time as the total amount equals three and ninety-nine one-hundredths cents a gallon. Any increase in proceeds resulting from the provisions of this subsection must be used exclusively for repairs, maintenance, and improvements to the state highway system.

Annually, funds from the user fee must be deposited to replenish the account to the extent and in an amount necessary to maintain an uncommitted or an unobligated fund balance of eighteen million dollars but not to exceed eighteen million dollars for the ensuing fiscal year, or both. The council may spend no more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, in the first year only, for a long-term economic development plan which must be submitted to the General Assembly on completion of the plan.

      "text": "(A)(1) Of total state source highway funds, including revenues generated by Section 12-28-2740, expended in a fiscal year on highway, bridge, and building construction, and building renovation contracts, the Department of Transportation and counties shall ensure that not less than: (a) five percent are expended through direct contracts with estimated values of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged ethnic minorities (MBEs); (b) five percent are expended through direct contracts with estimated values of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less with firms owned and controlled by disadvantaged females (WBEs). (2) The two hundred fifty thousand dollars value limits may be raised in the discretion of the department as MBEs/WBEs are able to provide bondability. (B) The department shall certify eligible firms under this section and shall give at least thirty days' notice to certified firms of contracts to be let. The department shall take into consideration the location and availability of MBE or WBE firms in the State when designating projects to be set aside. No certified MBE or WBE may participate after June 30, 1999, or nine years from the date of the firm's first contract, whichever is later, if that firm performed at least three million dollars in highway contracts for four consecutive years while certified as a WBE or MBE. Firms performing less than three million dollars in highway contracts for four consecutive years may be recertified for additional five-year periods based upon recertification reviews by the department. (C) To achieve the set-asides set forth in subsection (A), the department shall advertise a number of highway construction projects at each regularly scheduled highway letting to be bid exclusively by MBEs and WBEs. The total annual value of those projects awarded must equal at least ten percent of total state source highway funds expended in each fiscal year, or otherwise documented as described in subsection (D). Projects must be awarded when the lowest responsive and responsible bidder submits a bid within ten percent of the official engineer's estimate. If the lowest responsive bid exceeds the engineer's estimate by more than ten percent, the department may enter into negotiation with the low bidder making reasonable changes in the plans and specifications as necessary to bring the contract price within the ten percent range. If the low bidder agrees to the changes and the revised contract price, the contract must be awarded to the low bidder at the revised price. If the low bidder can show just cause for his bid exceeding the ten percent range, the department may award the contract without making any changes in the plans and specifications or the contract price. If the department fails to award any advertised project, that project may be readvertised through the normal bid process and must not be readvertised for the purpose of achieving the set-asides. (D) If no MBE or WBE firms certified pursuant to this section are available to perform a contract, the department shall verify and record this fact, and the verification must be preserved in department records. (E) To facilitate implementation of this section, the department may waive bonding requirements for contracts let pursuant to this section with estimated construction costs not exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars a contract, and any contract set aside and awarded to any MBE or WBE contractor without bonding shall provide expressly that termination of the contract for default of the contractor renders the contractor ineligible for any further department nonbonded contracts for a minimum period of two years from the date of the notice. The department shall act as bonding company when bonding requirements have been waived. Any claims brought by subcontractors or suppliers in connection with nonbonded projects must be heard by the Department Claims Committee and all legitimate claims must be paid by the department. The committee shall take into account circumstances such as unsettled payments and disputes with the department or other circumstances that are beyond the MBE/WBEs control. Claims resulting in monetary settlements shall render the MBE/WBEs ineligible for any further department nonbonded projects until the MBE/WBE has reimbursed or has made acceptable arrangements to reimburse the department for the amount due as a result of the settlement. (F) In awarding any contract pursuant to this section, preference must be given to an otherwise eligible South Carolina contractor submitting a responsible bid not exceeding an otherwise eligible out-of-state contractor's low bid by two and one-half percent. (G) The department shall establish written guidelines to be used in the selection and design of projects awarded under this section. Those guidelines shall outline the types of projects best suited for this program and other related criteria. (H) When a MBE or WBE receives a contract, the department shall furnish a letter, upon request, stating the dollar value and duration of, and other information about the contract, which may be used by the MBE or WBE in negotiating lines of credit with lending institutions. (I) The department shall issue an annual report listing all contracts awarded pursuant to this section. That report must also include a listing of all contracts and subcontracts awarded pursuant to Section 106(C) of the Federal Surface Transportation Act of 1987 (STAA-1987; P.L. 100-17, Section 106(c)). The listings must be both chronological and by name of participating firms. Entries must include file numbers, locations, and dollar amounts. The report must also contain information relating to canceled contracts and subcontracts, subcontractor substitutions, and final payments to MBE/WBEs. (J) Any MBE or WBE acting as a prime contractor shall perform at least thirty percent of the work with his own forces. If thirty percent of the work is performed with his own forces, the total amount of the contract is counted toward the MBE/WBE set-asides. If less than thirty percent is performed by the MBE/WBE, then only that portion performed by the MBE/WBE is counted toward the set-asides. (K) The department shall make available technical assistance for MBEs and WBEs for not less than three hundred thousand dollars. Any of these funds awarded to small consulting firms owned and controlled by MBEs or WBEs may count toward the set-asides established in subsection (A) of this section. The selected firms must be South Carolina based and experienced in assisting with the development of minority firms. (L) Technical assistance provided under subsection (K) must include written and verbal instruction on competitive bidding, management techniques, and general business operations. Firms certified under this section must be represented by a company officer in at least twenty hours of continuing education a year in order to remain certified. The department shall implement a system that will designate a lead engineer to work with MBE/WBEs. This engineer shall work with the office of compliance, the supportive services contractor, and with the department's engineers to provide early technical assistance to MBE/WBEs with contracts in each highway district. The support must include professional and technical assistance aimed toward meeting the standards, the specifications, the timing, quality, and other requirements of their contracts. The department also shall endeavor to utilize the expertise of established highway, bridge, and building contractors when providing technical and support services. (M) Any contracts awarded through the normal bid process to certified MBEs or WBEs may count toward the set-asides. Subcontracts entered into between prime contractors and certified MBE/WBEs without regard to these provisions may be counted toward the set-asides outlined in subsection (A) of this section if these subcontracts are verified through the department records. (N) If any part or provision of this section is declared to be unconstitutional or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction of this State, the court's decision, nevertheless, has no effect on the constitutionality, validity, and enforceability of the other parts and provisions of this section which are considered severable. (O) Within one hundred twenty days of the effective date of this section the department shall promulgate and implement regulations to administer the provisions of this section.
