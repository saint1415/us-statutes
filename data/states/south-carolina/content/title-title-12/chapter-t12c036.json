(B) The owner, or if the property is leased, the lessee, of transient construction property is liable for the use tax. (C) The tax is computed as follows: (1) divide the length of time the property will be used in this State by the total useful life of the property; (2) multiply the result from item (1) by the sales price of the property; (3) multiply the amount in item (2) by five percent. The result of the computation is the tax due. The useful life of transient construction property must be determined by the department in accordance with the experience and practices of the building and construction trade. In the absence of satisfactory evidence as to the period of use intended in this State, it is presumed that the property will remain in this State for the remainder of its useful life. (D) A prorated amount of the sales and use tax legally due and paid to another state on transient construction property is allowed as a credit, but only if the other state grants substantially similar tax credits on the property purchased in South Carolina. The prorated tax credit is computed as follows: (1) divide the length of time the property was used in the other state by the total useful life of the property; (2) multiply the result from item (1) by the state sales tax legally due and paid the other state; (3) the lesser of the result from item (2) or the tax computed in subsection (C) is the prorated credit amount. (E) If the state in which the property was previously used does not prorate its use tax on, or depreciate the value for use tax purposes of, transient construction property used by South Carolina contractors operating in that state, the use tax, at five percent of the sales price, applies. (F) Transient construction property purchased and substantially used in another state is not subject to the use tax if the owner of the property uses it to construct or repair his own buildings, structures, or other property located in this State. (G) The use, storage, or consumption of the property, when purchased for use in this State, is subject to the full amount of use tax provided in Section 12-36-1310(A), regardless of the period of intended use in this State. (H) The tax is due immediately upon transient construction property being brought into this State. HISTORY: 1990 Act No. 612, Part II, Section 74A.",

(2) \"Call-by-call basis\" means any method of charging for telecommunications services in which the price is measured by individual calls. (3) \"Communications channel\" means a physical or virtual path of communications over which signals are transmitted between or among customer channel termination points. (4) \"Customer\" means the person or entity that contracts with the seller of telecommunications services. If the end user of telecommunications services is not the contracting party, the end user of the telecommunications service is the customer of the telecommunication service, but this provision applies only for the purpose of sourcing sales of telecommunications services pursuant to Section 12-36-1920. \"Customer\" does not include a reseller of telecommunications service or a mobile telecommunications service of a serving carrier under an agreement to serve the customer outside the home service provider's licensed service area. (5) \"Customer channel termination point\" means the location where the customer either inputs or receives the communications. (6) \"End user\" means the person who utilizes the telecommunication service. In the case of an entity, \"end user\" means the individual who utilizes the telecommunication service. In the case of an entity, \"end user\" means the individual who utilizes the service on behalf of the entity. (7) \"Home service provider\" means the same as that term is defined in Section 124(5) of Public Law 106-252 (Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act). (8) \"Mobile telecommunications service\" means the same as that term is defined in Section 124(7) of Public Law 106-252 (Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act). (9) \"Place of primary use\" means the street address representative of the customer's primary use of the telecommunications service, which must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer. In the case of mobile telecommunications services, \"place of primary use\" must be within the licensed service area of the home service provider. (10) 'Post-paid calling service\" means the telecommunications service obtained by making a payment on a call-by-call basis either through the use of a credit card or payment mechanism like a bank card, travel card, credit card, or debit card, or by charge made to a telephone number which is not associated with the origination or termination of the telecommunications. A post-paid calling service includes a telecommunications service that would be a prepaid calling service except it is not exclusively a telecommunication service. (11) \"Prepaid calling service\" means the right to access exclusively telecommunications services, which must be paid for in advance and which enables the origination of calls using an access number or authorization code, whether manually or electronically dialed, and that is sold in predetermined units or dollars, of which the number declines with use in a known amount. (12) \"Private communication service\" means a telecommunication service that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels between or among termination points, regardless of the manner in which the channel or channels are connected, and includes switching capacity, extension lines, stations, and other associated services provided in connection with the use of the channel or channels. (13) \"Service address\" means: (a) the location of the telecommunications equipment to which a customer's call is charged and from which the call originates or terminates, regardless of where the call is billed or paid; (b) if the location in item (a) is not known, service address means the origination point of the signal of the telecommunications services first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system or in information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport the signals is not that of the seller; (c) if the location in item (a) and item (b) is not known, the service address means the location of the customer's place of primary use.

(2) In the case of a lease, the total tax rate required by this section applies on each payment until the total tax paid equals three hundred dollars. Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from paying the total tax due at the time of execution of the lease, or with any payment under the lease. To qualify for the tax limitation provided by this section, a lease must be in writing and specifically state the term of, and remain in force for, a period in excess of ninety continuous days. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, after June 30, 2017, the maximum tax imposed pursuant to this chapter on the sale, lease, or registration of an item enumerated in item (1) only applies to items not subject to the fee pursuant to Section 56-3-627. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, after June 30, 2017, the maximum tax imposed pursuant to this chapter on the sale, lease, or registration of an item enumerated in item (1) is increased from three hundred dollars to five hundred dollars, mutatis mutandis. Notwithstanding Section 59-21-1010, or any other provision of law, any revenue resulting from the increase contained in this item must be credited to the Infrastructure Maintenance Trust Fund. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, revenues resulting from the maximum tax imposed pursuant to this chapter on the sale, lease, or registration of an item enumerated in item (1) which would be subject to the fee set forth in Section 56-3-627 but for the state in which it is registered, must be collected by and remitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Upon collection, the Department of Motor Vehicles must transfer all the revenues to the Infrastructure Maintenance Trust Fund. (B) For the sale of a manufactured home, as defined in Section 40-29-20, the tax is calculated as follows: (1) subtract trade-in allowance from the sales price; (2) multiply the result from item (1) by sixty-five percent; (3) if the result from item (2) is no greater than six thousand dollars, multiply by five percent for the amount of tax due; (4) if the result from item (2) is greater than six thousand dollars, the tax due is three hundred dollars plus two percent of the amount greater than six thousand dollars. However, a manufactured home is exempt from any tax in excess of three hundred dollars that may be due as a result of the calculation in item (4) if it meets these energy efficiency levels: storm or double pane glass windows, insulated or storm doors, a minimum thermal resistance rating of the insulation only of R-11 for walls, R-19 for floors, and R-30 for ceilings. However, variations in the energy efficiency levels for walls, floors, and ceilings are allowed and the exemption on tax due above three hundred dollars applies if the total heat loss does not exceed that calculated using the levels of R-11 for walls, R-19 for floors, and R-30 for ceilings. The edition of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers Guide in effect at the time is the source for heat loss calculation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, from July 1, 2009, to July 1, 2024, a manufactured home is exempt from any tax that may be due as a result of the calculation in this subsection if it has been designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Energy as meeting or exceeding each agency's energy saving efficiency requirements or has been designated as meeting or exceeding such requirements under each agency's ENERGY STAR program. The dealer selling the manufactured home must maintain records, on forms provided by the State Energy Office, on each manufactured home sold that meets the energy efficiency levels provided for in this subsection. These records must be maintained for three years and must be made available for inspection upon request of the Department of Consumer Affairs or the State Energy Office. The maximum tax authorized by this subsection does not apply to a single-family modular home regulated pursuant to Chapter 43, Title 23. (C) For the sale of each musical instrument, or each piece of office equipment, purchased by a religious organization exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), the maximum tax imposed by this chapter is three hundred dollars. The musical instrument or office equipment must be located on church property and used exclusively for the organizations exempt purpose. The religious organization must furnish to the seller an affidavit on forms prescribed by the department. The affidavit must be retained by the seller. (D) Repealed. (E) Equipment provided, supplied, or installed on a firefighting vehicle is included with the vehicle for purposes of calculating the maximum tax due under this section.

(2) In addition to any other type of certificate the department considers necessary to issue, the department may issue at its discretion: (a) Direct Pay Certificate: a direct pay certificate allows its holder to make all purchases tax free and to report and pay directly to the department any taxes due. The holder of a direct pay certificate is liable for any taxes due. If an exemption or exclusion is not applicable, the tax is due upon the withdrawal, use, or consumption of the tangible personal property purchased with the certificate. (b) Exemption Certificate: an exemption certificate, as opposed to allowing its holder to make all purchases tax free, allows its holder to make only certain purchases tax free such as machinery, electricity, or raw materials. The holder of an exemption certificate is liable for any taxes due. If an exemption or exclusion is not applicable, the tax is due upon purchase, or upon the withdrawal, use, or consumption of the tangible personal property purchased with the certificate if the application of the exemption or exclusion cannot be determined at the time of purchase. (B) To reduce the complexity and administrative burden of transactions exempt from sales or use tax, the following provisions must be followed when a purchaser claims an exemption by use of an exemption certificate: (1) the seller shall obtain at the time of the purchase any information determined necessary by the department, including the reason the purchaser is claiming a tax exemption or exclusion; (2) the department, at its discretion, may utilize a system where the purchaser exempt from the payment of the tax is issued an identification number which must be presented to the seller at the time of the sale; (3) the seller shall maintain proper records of exempt or excluded transactions and provide them to the department when requested and in the form requested by the department. (C) A seller that complies with the provisions of this section is relieved from any tax otherwise applicable if it is determined that the purchaser improperly claimed an exemption or exclusion by use of a certificate, provided the seller did not fraudulently fail to collect or remit the tax, or both, or solicit a purchaser to participate in an unlawful claim of an exemption. The liability for tax shifts to the purchaser who improperly claimed the exemption or exclusion by use of the certificate.
