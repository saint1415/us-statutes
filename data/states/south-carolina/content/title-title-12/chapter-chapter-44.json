      "text": "The General Assembly finds that:\n\n(1) With the state's economy being centrally connected, as the wealth-generating capacity of South Carolina's businesses has increased, the state's per capita income also has increased.\n\n(2) Since South Carolina's property tax rates as applied to manufacturing and certain commercial properties are disproportionately higher than those applied to other property in South Carolina, this disparity and the resulting property tax burdens historically have impeded new and expanded business in South Carolina.\n\n(3) Previous General Assemblies have enacted legislation which reduces this disparity and the resulting property tax burden through a complex fee in lieu of tax arrangement that requires a company to transfer title to its property to the county and then lease the property back by paying rent and fees instead of property taxes on the property. The arrangement often includes the issuance of industrial revenue bonds by the county.\n\n(4) The transfer of title and issuance of bonds are expensive, complex, time-consuming, and difficult undertakings for the county, public, and companies to understand and implement. The current rules also make financings more difficult and more expensive. All of these factors act to discourage new investments in South Carolina.\n\n(5) The \"Fee in Lieu of Tax Simplification Act\" simplifies the method for obtaining the fee in lieu of tax benefits while maintaining the essential county council approval process.\n\n(6) The \"Fee in Lieu of Tax Simplification Act\" makes the fee in lieu of tax incentive more attractive by eliminating the requirement for the issuance of industrial revenue bonds or the transfer of title of property to a county. This simplification facilitates the benefit for the county and the company making the investments.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 149, Section 1; 2003 Act No. 69, Section 3.AAA.1, eff January 1, 2003.",

The commencement date for an economic development project as defined in item (17) is the last day of the first property tax year in which economic development property is placed in service.\n\n(3) \"County\" means the county or counties in which the project is proposed to be located. A project may be located in more than one county, subject to the provisions of Section 12-44-40(H).\n\n(4) \"County council\" means the governing body of the county in which the economic development property is located, except as specifically provided by Section 12-44-40(H).\n\n(5) \"Department\" means the South Carolina Department of Revenue.\n\n(6) \"Economic development property\" means each item of real and tangible personal property comprising a project which satisfies the provisions of Section 12-44-40(C) and other requirements of this chapter and is subject to a fee agreement. That property, other than replacement property qualifying under Section 12-44-60, must be placed in service by the end of the investment period.\n\n(7) \"Enhanced investment\" means a project that results in a total investment:\n\n(a) by a single sponsor investing at least one hundred fifty million dollars and creating at least one hundred twenty-five new full-time jobs at the project; provided that the new full-time jobs requirement of this subsection does not apply to a taxpayer who paid more than fifty percent of all property taxes actually collected in the county for more than twenty-five years, ending on the date of the fee agreement;\n\n(b) by a single sponsor investing at least four hundred million dollars; or\n\n(c) that satisfies the requirements of Section 11-41-30(2)(a), and for which the Secretary of Commerce has delivered certification pursuant to Section 11-41-70(2)(a).\n\nFor purposes of this item, if a single sponsor enters into a financing arrangement of the type described in Section 12-44-120(B), the investment in or financing of the property by a developer, lessor, financing entity, or other third party in accordance with this arrangement is considered investment by the sponsor. Investment by a related person to the sponsor, as described in Section 12-10-80(D)(2), is considered investment by the sponsor.\n\n(8) \"Exemption period\" means the period beginning on the first day of the property tax year after the property tax year in which an applicable piece of economic development property is placed in service and ending on the termination date. For projects which are completed and placed in service during more than one year, the exemption period applies to each year's investment made by a sponsor during the investment period.\n\n(9) \"Fee\" means the amount paid in lieu of ad valorem property tax as provided in the fee agreement.\n\n(10) \"Fee agreement\" means an agreement between the sponsor and the county obligating the sponsor to pay fees instead of property taxes during the exemption period for each item of economic development property as more particularly described in Section 12-44-40.\n\n(11) \"Inducement resolution\" means a resolution of the county setting forth the commitment of the county to enter into a fee agreement.\n\n(12) \"Infrastructure improvement credit\" means a credit against the fee as provided by Section 12-44-70.\n\n(13) \"Investment period\" means the period beginning with the first day that economic development property is purchased or acquired and ending five years after the commencement date; except that for a project with an enhanced investment as described above, the period ends eight years after the commencement date. The minimum investment must be completed within five years of the commencement date. For an enhanced investment, the applicable minimum investment and job requirements under item (7) must be completed within eight years of the commencement date. Investment period means for a qualified nuclear plant facility the period beginning with the first day that economic development property is purchased or acquired and ending ten years after the commencement date. For those sponsors that, after qualifying for the enhanced investment, have more than five hundred million dollars in capital invested in this State and employ more than one thousand people in this State, the investment period ends ten years after the commencement date. If the sponsor does not anticipate completing the project within these periods, the sponsor may apply to the county before the end of the investment period for an extension of time to complete the project. The extension may not exceed five years. If a project receives an extension of less than five years, the sponsor may apply to the county before the end of the extension period for an additional extension of time to complete the project for an aggregate extension of not more than five years. Unless approved as part of the original fee documentation, the county council of the county may approve an extension by resolution, a copy of which must be delivered to the department within thirty days of the date the resolution was adopted. An extension is not allowed for the time period in which the sponsor must meet the minimum investment requirement.\n\n(14) \"Minimum investment\" means an investment in the project of at least two and one-half million dollars within the investment period. If a county has an average annual unemployment rate of at least twice the state average during the last twenty-four month period based on data available on the most recent November first, the minimum investment is one million dollars. The department shall designate these reduced investment counties by December thirty-first of each year using data from the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce and the United States Department of Commerce. The designations are effective for a sponsor whose fee agreement is signed in the calendar year following the county designation. For all purposes of this chapter, the minimum investment may include amounts expended by a sponsor or sponsor affiliate as a nonresponsible party in a voluntary cleanup contract on the property pursuant to Article 7, Chapter 56, Title 44, the Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup Program, if the Department of Health and Environmental Control certifies completion of the cleanup. If the amounts under the Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup Program equal at least one million dollars, the investment threshold requirement of this chapter is deemed to have been met.\n\n(15) \"Industrial development park\" means an industrial or business park developed by two or more counties as defined in Section 4-1-170.\n\n(16) \"Project\" means land, buildings, and other improvements on the land, including water, sewage treatment and disposal facilities, air pollution control facilities, and all other machinery, apparatus, equipment, office facilities, and furnishings which are considered necessary, suitable, or useful by a sponsor. \"Project\" also may consist of or include aircraft hangered or utilizing an airport in a county so long as the county expressly consents to its inclusion. Aircraft previously subject to taxation in South Carolina qualify pursuant to this provision.\n\n(17) \"Qualified nuclear plant facility\" means a nuclear electric power generating plant regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and includes all real and personal property incorporated into or associated with the facility located or to be located within this State with a total minimum level of investment of one billion dollars.\n\n(18) \"Replacement property\" means property placed under the fee agreement to replace economic development property previously subject to the fee agreement, as provided in Section 12-44-60.\n\n(19) \"Sponsor\" means one or more entities which sign the fee agreement with the county and makes the minimum investment, subject to the provisions of Section 12-44-40, each of which makes the minimum investment as provided in item (13) and also includes a sponsor affiliate unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. If a project consists of a manufacturing, research and development, corporate office, or distribution facility, as those terms are defined in Section 12-6-3360(M) and including a qualified nuclear plant facility as defined in item (17) of this section, each sponsor or sponsor affiliate is not required to invest the minimum investment if the total investment at the project exceeds five million dollars.\n\n(20) \"Sponsor affiliate\" means an entity that joins with or is an affiliate of a sponsor and that participates in the investment in, or financing of, a project.\n\n(21) \"Termination date\" means the date that is the last day of a property tax year that is no later than the twenty-ninth year following the first property tax year in which an applicable piece of economic development property is placed in service. A sponsor may apply to the county prior to the termination date for an extension of the termination date beyond the twenty-ninth year up to ten years. The county council of the county shall approve an extension by resolution upon a finding of substantial public benefit. A copy of the resolution must be delivered to the department within thirty days of the date the resolution was adopted. With respect to a fee agreement involving an enhanced investment, the termination date is the last day of a property tax year that is no later than the thirty-ninth year following the first property tax year in which an applicable piece of economic development property is placed in service. A sponsor may apply to the county before the termination date for an extension of the termination date beyond the thirty-ninth year up to ten years. If the fee agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 12-44-140, the termination date is the date the agreement is terminated.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 149, Section 1; 1999 Act no. 100, Part II, Section 20; 2000 Act No. 283, Section 3(D), eff May 19, 2000; 2001 Act No. 89, Section 65C, eff July 20, 2001; 2002 Act No. 280, Section 3, eff May 2, 2002; 2002 Act No. 334, Section 1, eff June 24, 2002; 2003 Act No. 69, Section 3.P, eff June 18, 2003; 2003 Act No. 69, Section 3.AAA.1, eff January 1, 2003; 2005 Act No. 71, Section 2, eff May 23, 2005; 2005 Act No. 145, Section 44.A, eff June 7, 2005; 2005 Act No. 161, Section 40.A, eff June 9, 2005; 2007 Act No. 116, Section 7.E, eff June 28, 2007; 2008 Act No. 313, Sections 2.F, 2.I.3, eff June 12, 2008; 2008 Act No. 352, Section 2.F, eff June 12, 2008; 2010 Act No. 150, Section 1, eff April 27, 2010; 2010 Act No. 161, Sections 2.A to 2.D, eff May 12, 2010; 2010 Act No. 290, Sections 8.A, 37, eff June 23, 2010; 2010 Act No. 290, Section 8.A, eff January 1, 2011; 2012 Act No. 187, Section 3, eff June 7, 2012.",

      "text": "(A) To obtain the benefits provided by this chapter, the sponsor and the county must enter into a fee agreement requiring the payment of the fee described in Section 12-44-50. The county must adopt an ordinance approving the fee agreement with the sponsor.\n\n(B) If the county and the sponsor enter into a fee agreement, all economic development property is exempt from all ad valorem property taxation for the entire exemption period. Upon termination of the exemption period, the property is subject to property taxation in the manner provided by law, unless the property is otherwise exempt.\n\n(C) Subject to the provisions of subsection (D) and the provisions of Section 12-44-110, real or tangible personal property of a sponsor or sponsor affiliate which has been acquired for which expenditures have been incurred by the sponsor or sponsor affiliate and which are used in connection with a project or a portion of a project, qualifies as economic development property, if the expenditures are incurred or the property is acquired before the end of the investment period.\n\n(D) A county has two years from the date it takes action reflecting or identifying the project, or proposed project, to adopt an inducement resolution if the inducement resolution was not the original county action reflecting or identifying the project or proposed project. Otherwise, expenditures incurred before adoption of the inducement resolution do not qualify as economic development property.\n\n(E) If a fee agreement is not executed within five years after action by the county identifying or reflecting the project, the real property or tangible personal property of a sponsor for which expenditures have been incurred by the sponsor with respect to the project does not qualify as economic development property. An action includes an inducement resolution adopted by the county council of the county.\n\n(F) Notwithstanding another provision of this chapter, in the case of a qualified nuclear plant facility, the sponsor has five years from the end of the calendar year in which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission grants the sponsor a combined license to construct and operate a nuclear power plant to enter into a fee agreement with the county but in no event more than fifteen years from the latter of the adoption of an inducement resolution or execution of an inducement agreement by the county.\n\n(G) To be eligible to enter into a fee agreement, the sponsor shall commit to a project which meets the minimum investment level and, with respect to applicable enhanced investments, the total applicable investment and the minimum job creation levels required for an enhanced investment.\n\n(H) The project must be located in a single county or in an industrial development park. A project located on contiguous tracts of land in more than one county, but not in an industrial development park, may qualify for the fee if:\n\n(1) the counties agree on the terms of the fee and the distribution of the fee payment;\n\n(2) a minimum millage rate is provided for in the agreement; and\n\n(3) all counties are parties to all agreements establishing the terms of the fee.\n\n(I)(1) Before undertaking a project, the county council shall find that:\n\n(a) the project is anticipated to benefit the general public welfare of the locality by providing services, employment, recreation, or other public benefits not otherwise adequately provided locally;\n\n(b) the project gives rise to no pecuniary liability of the county or incorporated municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing power; and\n\n(c) the purposes to be accomplished by the project are proper governmental and public purposes and the benefits of the project are greater than the costs.\n\n(2) In making the findings of this subsection, the county council may seek the advice and assistance of the department or the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The determination and findings must be set forth in an ordinance.\n\n(J) If the county council has by contractual agreement provided for a change in fee in lieu of taxes arrangements conditioned on a future legislative enactment, a new enactment does not bind the original parties to the agreement unless the change is ratified by the county council.\n\n(K)(1) Upon agreement of the parties, and except as provided in item (2), a fee agreement may be amended or terminated and replaced with regard to all matters, including the addition or removal of sponsors or sponsor affiliates.\n\n(2) An amendment or replacement of a fee agreement must not be used to lower the millage rate, discount rate, assessment ratio, or, except as provided in Sections 12-44-30(13) and (21), increase the term of the agreement.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 149, Section 1; 2000 Act No. 283, Section 3(E), eff May 19, 2000; 2003 Act No. 69, Section 3.AAA.1, eff January 1, 2003; 2007 Act No. 116, Section 7.F, eff June 28, 2007; 2010 Act No. 161, Section 3, eff May 12, 2010; 2010 Act No. 290, Section 9, eff June 23, 2010.",

The fair market value estimate established for the first year of the fee remains the fair market value of the real property for the life of the fee.

Net present value calculations must use a discount rate equivalent to the yield in effect for new or existing United States Treasury bonds of similar maturity as published during the month in which the fee agreement is executed. If no yield is available for the month in which the fee agreement is executed, the last published yield for the appropriate maturity available must be used. If there are no bonds of appropriate maturity available, bonds of different maturities may be averaged to obtain the appropriate maturity.\n\n(B)(1) If a sponsor disposes of an item of economic development property, the fee must be reduced by the amount of the fee applicable to that item of economic development property. Economic development property is disposed of only when it is scrapped or sold or it is removed from the project. If it is removed from the project, it is subject to ad valorem property taxes to the extent the property remains in the State.\n\n(2) If the sponsor used an alternative payment method as provided in subsection (A)(3), the fee applicable to the item of property which was disposed of must be recomputed in accordance with subsection (A)(1) and, to the extent that the amount which would have been paid with respect to this item under subsection (A)(1) exceeds the fee actually paid by the sponsor, the sponsor shall pay the difference with the next annual fee payment due after the item of property is disposed of.

Notwithstanding another provision of this chapter, an equity interest in a sponsor may be transferred to another entity or person at any time. To the extent that the fee agreement is transferred, for the purposes of calculating the fee, the transferee assumes the current basis the sponsor has in real or personal property subject to the fee.\n\n(B) A sponsor may enter into lending, financing, security, leasing, or similar arrangements, or succession of such arrangements, with a financing entity concerning all or part of a project including, without limitation, a sale-leaseback arrangement, equipment lease, build-to-suit lease, synthetic lease, nordic lease, defeased tax benefit, or transfer lease, an assignment, sublease, or similar arrangement, or succession of such arrangements, with one or more financing entities concerning all or part of a project, regardless of the identity of the income tax owner of economic development property. Even though income tax basis is changed for income tax purposes, neither the original transfer to the financing entity nor the later transfer from the financing entity back to the sponsor, pursuant to terms in the sale-leaseback agreement, affects the amount of the fee due.\n\n(C) All transfers undertaken with respect to other projects to effect a financing authorized under this subsection must meet the following requirements:\n\n(1) The department and the county must receive notification, in writing within sixty days after the transfer, of the identity of each transferee and other information required by the department with the appropriate returns. Failure to meet this notice requirement does not adversely affect the fee, but a penalty may be assessed by the department for late notification for up to ten thousand dollars a year or portion of a year, up to a maximum penalty of fifty thousand dollars.\n\n(2) If a financing entity is the income tax owner of property, either the financing entity is primarily liable for the fee as to that portion of the project to which the transfer relates, with the sponsor remaining secondarily liable for the payment, or the sponsor must agree to continue to be primarily liable for the annual payments as to that portion of the project to which the transfer relates.\n\n(D) A sponsor may transfer a fee agreement, or substantially all the economic development property to which the fee agreement relates, if it obtains the prior approval, or subsequent ratification, of the county with which it entered into the fee agreement. The county's prior approval or subsequent ratification may be evidenced by any one of the following, in the absolute and sole discretion of the county providing the approval or ratification: (i) a letter or other writing executed by an authorized county representative as designated in the respective fee agreement; (ii) a resolution passed by the county council; or (iii) an ordinance passed by the county council following three readings and a public hearing.
