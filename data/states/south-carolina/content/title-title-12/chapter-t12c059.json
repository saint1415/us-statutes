(B) For purposes of this section, \"subdivided properties\" refer to a parcel or parcels of real property, residential or commercial, made up of multiple lots. (C) The petition to the Department of Revenue must provide for: (1) all necessary documentation to support the past and anticipated future adverse impacts, including historical data on the number and percentage of properties bid into the forfeited land commission; (2) the loss of ad valorem tax revenues associated with these properties; (3) the impact of any millage increases imposed by the county to compensate for such lost ad valorem tax revenues; (4) the past and projected future impact on the ability of the county to deliver essential public services; and (5) the past and projected future impact on county development and employment opportunities.

This authorization may be extended for additional one-year increments, not to exceed two one-year extensions. Petitions for extensions must contain the same types of documentation specified in subsection (C).

This fund shall be established and maintained by the county treasurer from a portion of the proceeds of the sale of forfeited lands in an amount not exceeding fifty percent of the sale price of any forfeited land, in whole or in part. Legal and other expenses for which the funds may be expended may not include compensation to any members of the commission, but may include: (a) payment of legal or other expenses in connection with the commission's decision to accept or reject a forfeited land to be held as an asset of the county; (b) payment of legal or other expenses in connection with the commission's decision to obtain clear title to a forfeited land pursuant to Section 12-61-10; (c) payment of a commission to a certified realtor or broker not to exceed three percent of the sales price of any forfeited land, in whole or in part; (d) the cost of advertising the sale of forfeited lands, including the cost of any multiple realty listing established or provided by commercial realtors or brokers; and (e) the cost of any clean up of a site, including demolition and disposal costs, intended to make the property salable. (2) The acquisition of clear title to forfeited lands shall be considered an industrial or commercial development project pursuant to Chapter 29, Title 4, for which a county council may issue special revenue bonds for the purpose of initial funding of revolving funds under this section. Payment of the principal and interest for such bonds may be made from the proceeds of the sale of the forfeited lands. (3) The forfeited land commission of a county that has established a revolving fund under this section shall dissolve or reduce the amount of funds held by the county treasurer in the fund when it is no longer required for the timely and effective marketing and sale of forfeited lands. The released funds will be deposited into the general fund of the county not later than thirty days from the date of decision by the commission or the date of the expiration of the authorization and, if necessary, may be used to complete any payment of principal and interest remaining from the sale of any special revenue bonds used for the initial establishment of the revolving fund. (4) The authorized representative of a forfeited land commission that elects to clear tax titles pursuant to Section 12-61-10 may bring multiple actions to the court of common pleas in a single suit, if all of the properties included in the suit were previously owned by a single, individual, partnership, or corporation. (5) The payment of the expenses of forfeited land commissions exercising authority under this section shall include the collection of its expenses as a part of the sale price of forfeited lands by former owners pursuant to Section 12-59-60 and the disposition of the proceeds of land sales pursuant to Section 12-59-100.

(7) Investments by county treasurers under Section 12-45-220(A) may include sums held by the treasurer on behalf of a forfeited land commission under this section.
