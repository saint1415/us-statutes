These damages must be assessed at the same time as the deficiency, paid upon notice and demand from the department, and collected as a part of the tax.\n\n(K) A failure to deposit or pay taxes deducted and withheld pursuant to Article 5, Chapter 8 subjects the withholding agent to a penalty of not less than ten dollars nor more than one thousand dollars.

The use taxes in this case may be assessed at any time within twelve months after the department receives the information, but no later than seventy-two months after the last day the use tax may be paid without penalty.\n\n(D)(1) Taxes due to an understatement of taxes resulting from adjustments of the Internal Revenue Service also may be determined and assessed after the thirty-six month limitation if:\n\n(a) except as provided in subitem (b), in the case of income, estate, and generation skipping transfer taxes, the taxes are assessed before one hundred eighty days after the department receives notice from the taxpayer of a final determination of a tax adjustment made by the Internal Revenue Service; or\n\n(b) in the case of individual income tax returns described in subitem (4)(c) below, the taxes are assessed before one hundred eighty days after the department receives notice of the tax adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service or the taxpayer, whichever occurs first.\n\n(2) A person, including a pass-through entity, who conducts a trade or business, other than a trade or business of being an employee, shall notify the department in writing of all changes in taxable income reported to the Internal Revenue Service when the taxable income is changed by the Internal Revenue Service. Notification to the department must be made before one hundred eighty days after a final determination of a tax adjustment is made by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding a restriction on filing a claim for refund provided in subsection (F), a person may file a claim for refund resulting from an overpayment due to changes in taxable income made by the Internal Revenue Service, if the claim for refund is filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the date a final determination of a tax adjustment is made by the Internal Revenue Service. The refund described in this subsection applies only to the overpayment of taxes resulting from adjustments of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this subsection (D):\n\n(a) the date the Internal Revenue Service makes a final determination of a tax adjustment is the federal assessment date;\n\n(b) underpayments and overpayments resulting from adjustments of the Internal Revenue Service include both the year for which the adjustments were made and other tax years affected by the adjustments; and\n\n(c) the individual income tax returns referred to in subsection (D)(1)(b) are those individual income tax returns that do not include income, deductions, or credits from a trade or business, other than the trade or business of being an employee.\n\n(E) A tax may not be collected by levy, warrant for distraint, or proceedings in court, unless the:\n\n(1) levy, warrant for distraint, or proceedings in court were begun within ten years after the assessment of the tax;\n\n(2) taxpayer has agreed to extend this period; or\n\n(3) running of this period is suspended in accordance with this section.\n\nFor property tax purposes, the \"assessment of the tax\" occurs on the later of the last day the tax may be paid without penalty or the date of the tax notice.\n\n(F)(1) Except as provided in subsection (D), claims for credit or refund must be filed within three years from the time the return was filed, or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. If no return was filed, a claim for credit or refund must be filed within two years from the date the tax was paid. A credit or refund may not be made after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in this item for the filing of a claim for credit or refund, unless the claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer or determined to be due by the department within that period.\n\n(2) If the claim was filed by the taxpayer during the three-year period prescribed in item (1), the amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period, immediately preceding the filing of the claim, equal to three years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return.\n\n(3) If the claim was not filed within the three-year period, the amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim.\n\n(4) If no claim was filed, the credit or refund may not exceed the amount which would be allowable under item (2) or (3), as the case may be, as if a claim were filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(a) A return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing is considered as filed on the last day. Payment of any portion of the tax made before the last day prescribed for the payment of the tax is considered made on the last day. The last day prescribed for filing the return or paying the tax must be determined without regard to any extension of time.\n\n(b) Any tax actually withheld at the source in respect of the recipient of income, is considered to have been paid by the recipient on the last day prescribed for filing his return for the taxable year, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return, with respect to which the taxpayer would be allowed a credit for the amount withheld.\n\n(c) Any amount paid as estimated income tax for any taxable year is considered to have been paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return for the taxable year, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return.\n\n(6) In the case of an individual, the running of the period specified in this subsection is suspended for a period of the individual's life during which he is financially disabled. For purposes of this item, an individual is financially disabled if he is unable to manage his financial affairs by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or which has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months. An individual must not be treated as financially disabled for a period during which his spouse or another person is authorized to act on his behalf in financial matters. An individual must not be considered financially disabled unless the following statements are submitted as part of the claim for credit or refund:\n\n(a) a written statement signed by a physician qualified to make the determination that provides the:\n\n(i) name and a brief description of the physical or mental impairment;\n\n(ii) physician's medical opinion that the physical or mental impairment prevented the taxpayer from managing his financial affairs;\n\n(iii) physician's medical opinion that the taxpayer's physical or mental impairment resulted in, or is expected to result in, death, or that it has lasted, or is expected to last, for a continuous period of not less than twelve months; and ( iv) specific time period during which the taxpayer was prevented by the physical or mental impairment from managing his financial affairs, to the best of the physician's knowledge; and\n\n(b) a written statement by the taxpayer or the person signing the claim for credit or refund that the person, including the taxpayer's spouse, was not authorized to act on his behalf in financial matters for the period during which he was unable to manage his own financial affairs. Alternatively, if a person was authorized to act on the taxpayer's behalf in financial matters during part of that period of disability, the statement must contain the beginning and ending dates of the period of time the person was authorized; and\n\n(c) other information the department may require.\n\nThe department, in its discretion, may adopt a determination made by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to an individual, and may follow rules issued by the Internal Revenue Service or Department of Treasury with regard to interpreting Internal Revenue Code Section 6511(h).\n\n(G) The running of the period of limitations provided in subsections (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this section is suspended:\n\n(1) for ninety days after the date the taxpayer gives notice of termination of a waiver or extension of the assessment period;\n\n(2) for ninety days after the date of a proposed assessment, property tax assessment notice, or tax notice;\n\n(3) from the date of a proposed assessment, property tax assessment notice, or tax notice, until ninety days after a decision becomes final, if a taxpayer protests the proposed assessment, property tax assessment notice, or tax notice;\n\n(4) from the date when an action is stayed by injunction, order of a court, or statutory prohibition, until ninety days after the injunction or prohibition is lifted; and\n\n(5) during the pendency of a stay ordered by the Taxpayers' Rights Advocate.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 60, Section 4D(1); 1996 Act No. 456, Section 5; 1997 Act No. 86, Section 1; 1998 Act No. 386, Section 3; 1998 Act No. 442, Section 4D; 1999 Act No. 114, Section 3; 2000 Act No. 399, Sections 3(U)(1) and (2), eff August 17, 2000; 2001 Act No. 89, Sections 33, 34, eff July 20, 2001, applicable to tax periods beginning after December 31, 1997; 2007 Act No. 110, Section 28.A, eff June 21, 2007; 2007 Act No. 116, Section 34.A, eff June 28, 2007.",

This item does not apply to a judgment or an amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action against this State to the extent that this State offsets the judgment or settlement amount against any liability of the taxpayer to this State;\n\n(8) a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, as against the organization which is the insurer under the contract, at any time:\n\n(a) before the organization had actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien; or\n\n(b) after the organization had notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien, with respect to advances required to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the organization had notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien;\n\n(9) a savings deposit, share, or other account, evidenced by a passbook, with an institution described in 26 U.S.C.

For purposes of this subsubitem, the furnishing of goods and services is treated as the disbursement of cash.\n\n(d) \"Obligatory disbursement agreement\" means an agreement entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business to make disbursements, but only to the extent of disbursements required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of a person other than the taxpayer.\n\n(e) \"Qualified property\", when used with respect to a commercial transaction financing agreement, means only commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer before day forty-six after the date of the tax lien filing.\n\n(f) \"Qualified property\", when used with respect to a real property construction or improvement financing agreement, means only:\n\n(i) the real property with respect to which construction or improvement has been or will be made;\n\n(ii) the proceeds of a contract to construct or improve real property; and\n\n(iii) property subject to the tax lien at the time of the tax lien filing and the crop or the livestock or other animals referred to in item (2)(c)(iii).\n\n(g)(i) \"Qualified property\", when used with respect to an obligatory disbursement agreement, means property subject to the tax lien imposed by Section 12-54-120 at the time of the tax lien filing and, to the extent the acquisition is directly traceable to the disbursements referred to in subitem (d), property acquired by the taxpayer after the tax lien filing.\n\n(ii) When the obligatory disbursement agreement is an agreement ensuring the performance of a contract between the taxpayer and another person, the term \"qualified property\" also includes the proceeds of the surety contract.\n\n(iii) If the surety contract ensured performance of a contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to furnish services, the term \"qualified property\" also includes any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the performance of the ensured contract.\n\n(E) Even though notice of a tax lien is filed, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest arising out of disbursements made before the forty-sixth day after the date the tax lien was filed or before the person making the disbursement had actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, whichever is earlier, but only if the security interest is:\n\n(1) in property subject to the tax lien at the time it is filed and covered by the terms of a written agreement entered into before the filing; and\n\n(2) protected under the laws of this State against a judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation.\n\n(F) If the tax lien is not valid as against another lien or security interest, the priority of the other lien or security interest extends to:\n\n(1) any interest or carrying charges upon the secured obligation;\n\n(2) the reasonable charges and expenses of a trustee or agent holding the security interest for the benefit of the holder of the security interest;\n\n(3) the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fee, actually incurred in collecting or enforcing the secured obligation;\n\n(4) the reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing the property to which the lien or security interest relates;\n\n(5) the reasonable costs of insuring payment of the secured obligation; and\n\n(6) amounts paid to satisfy a lien on the property to which the other lien or security interest relates, but only if the satisfied lien has priority over the tax lien to the extent that, under the laws of this State, any such item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates.\n\n(G)(1) The tax lien notice must be filed with the clerk of court or, where appropriate, the register of mesne conveyances. The appropriate official shall enter the name of the taxpayer in the judgment docket in the column for judgment debtors and, in appropriate columns, the amount of tax, penalties, and the date of filing, and shall index the tax lien on the index of judgment.\n\n(2) The form and content of the notice of tax lien must be prescribed by the department, and the notice, as prescribed, is valid notwithstanding another provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien.\n\n(3) The notice of tax lien may be filed by the department or its authorized agent at any time and in any county the department finds appropriate.\n\n(4)(a) Instead of filing a tax lien notice pursuant to item (1), the department may implement a statewide system of filing and indexing liens which must be accessible to the public over the Internet. The department shall notify all clerks of court and registers of deeds upon the implementation of a statewide system. Upon implementation, the clerk of courts and register of deeds are relieved of any statutory obligations for filing and maintaining newly filed tax liens.\n\n(b) A lien filed pursuant to item (1) has an affixed permanent date and time stamp reflecting the date and time the lien is available to the public on the Internet, the name of the taxpayer, and the amount of tax and penalties and remains effective from the date and time it was recorded. A lien filed pursuant to this item is effective statewide from the date and time it is recorded and available to the public over the Internet and encumbers all the taxpayer's property and rights to property as provided in Section 12-54-120, regardless of the property's location. Nothing in this item may be construed so as to extend the effectiveness of a lien beyond ten years from the date of filing, as provided in Section 12-54-120.\n\n(c) A notice must be posted in each county where liens are generally filed providing instructions on how to access the department's tax lien database.\n\n(H)(1) For purposes of this section, an organization has actual notice or knowledge of a fact about a particular transaction from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction or from the time the fact would have been brought to his attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routine. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of his regular duties or unless he has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.\n\n(2) When a person is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or interest under the laws of this State, that person is subrogated to those rights for purposes of the tax lien imposed by Section 12-54-120.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 345, Section 2; 2019 Act No. 13 (S.160), Section 1, eff July 1, 2019.",
