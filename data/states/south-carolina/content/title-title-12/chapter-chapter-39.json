At any time prior to payment of the tax the auditor shall also correct upon the duplicate for any tax year any errors that may be discovered that were made by county or state officers.

At any time before the tax is paid the auditor shall also correct other errors in the duplicate when such errors invalidate or make void the collection of the tax reflected by reason of such error. If the correction results in a reduction or withdrawal of the taxes assessed or levied, the correction shall be in the form of an abatement and a record of such correction and the reasons therefor shall be maintained in an abatement book. When any personal or real property has been entered for taxation in the wrong locality, the auditor shall correct the error at any time prior to payment of the tax and charge such tax in the correct locality. Any corrections made in the duplicate by the auditor shall be entered on both the auditor's and treasurer's duplicate, except that in the case of a reduction of any assessment or tax, the auditor may furnish the treasurer with a certificate of reduction.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the county tax assessor or the County Board of Assessment Appeals, upon application of the taxpayer, must order the county auditor to make appropriate adjustments in the valuation and assessment of any real property and improvements which have sustained damage as a result of fire, flooding, hurricane, or wind event provided, that the application for correction of the assessment is made prior to payment of the tax.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 65-1779; 1952 Code Section 65-1779; 1942 Code Section 2727; 1932 Code Section 2727; Civ.
