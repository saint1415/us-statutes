For purposes of this section, amounts reasonably related to personal services include amounts reasonably related to the personal services of the owner, the owner's spouse, and any person claimed as a dependent on the owner's income tax return.\n\n(2) \"Pass-through businesses\" means sole proprietorships, partnerships, and \"S\" corporations, including limited liability companies taxed as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or \"S\" corporations.\n\n(B)(1) Notwithstanding Section 12-6-510, a taxpayer may elect annually to have the income tax at the rate provided in item (2) of this subsection imposed annually on the active trade or business income received by the owner of a pass-through business. For joint returns, the election is effective for both spouses. The amount subject to tax pursuant to this section is not subject to tax pursuant to Section 12-6-510.\n\n(2) The rate of the income tax imposed pursuant to this subsection is:\n\nTaxable Year Beginning in Rate of Tax 2006 6.5 percent 2007 6 percent 2008 5.5 percent 2008 through 2011 5 percent 2012 4.33 percent 2013 3.67 percent after 2013 3 percent\n\n(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, active trade or business loss must first be deducted, dollar for dollar against active trade or business income. Any remaining active trade or business loss is deductible from income taxed under Section 12-6-510 if otherwise allowable.\n\n(D) The department may issue guidance as to what expenses reduce active trade or business income.\n\n(E)(1) Notwithstanding item (A)(1)(d) of this section, if a taxpayer owns an interest in one or more pass-through businesses and his total South Carolina taxable income from pass-through entities for which he performs personal services is one hundred thousand dollars or less, excluding capital gains and losses, then the taxpayer may elect, instead of determining the actual amount of active trade or business income related to his personal services, to treat fifty percent of his active trade or business income as not related to his personal services. For purposes of this item, the term \"taxpayer\" includes both taxpayers who file a joint return.\n\n(2) The department may provide other methods that may be used to determine an amount that is considered to be unrelated to the owner's personal services if it determines that the benefits to the State of taxing income from personal services at a higher rate are insufficient to justify the burdens imposed on the taxpayer.\n\n(F) An income tax credit available to offset taxes due pursuant to Section 12-6-510 also apply against taxes imposed by this section.\n\n(G)(1)(a) \"Qualified entity\" means a partnership or \"S\" Corporation including a limited liability company taxed as a partnership or \"S\" Corporation, where all of its owners are qualified owners or partnerships, and, where those partnerships are owned directly or through other partnerships by qualified owners.\n\n(b) \"Qualified owner\" means a partner or shareholder of a qualified entity that is an individual, estate, trust, or any other entity except those taxed or exempted from tax pursuant to Sections 12-6-530 through 12-6-540 and 12-6-550 and except for any other entity exempt from South Carolina income tax.\n\n(2) A qualified entity may elect annually under this subsection to have its income taxed on its active trade or business income at the rate provided in subsection (B)(2) imposed on the qualified entity itself. Such elections must be made no later than the due date for filing the applicable income tax return, including any extensions.\n\n(3) In computing South Carolina taxable income, a qualified owner shall exclude active trade or business income from an electing qualified entity provided that the qualified entity properly filed an income tax return and paid the taxes pursuant to this subsection that included the active trade or business income or loss.\n\n(4) Active trade or business losses of the qualified owner from other pass-through entities that are reported directly by such owner may not reduce tax at a rate higher than the rate provided in subsection (B)(2).\n\n(5) Active trade or business income for which this subsection is elected shall be apportioned by the pass-through entity pursuant to Section 12-6-2240, and none of it shall be treated as income from personal services that is allocated pursuant to Section 12-6-2220(6).\n\n(6) Section 12-8-590, dealing with tax withholding on distributions to nonresident shareholders of \"S\" Corporations and nonresident partners, does not apply to electing qualified entities to the extent of the tax the electing entities pay on their active trade or business income.\n\n(7) For tax years beginning after 2021, an electing qualified entity shall submit estimated tax payments pursuant to Section 12-6-3910.\n\n(8) If the electing entity fails to pay the amount owed to the department with respect to income as a result of the election, the department may collect the amount from the electing entity or its direct or indirect owners based upon their proportionate share of the income, or both.\n\n(9) The basis of both resident and nonresident shareholders of a qualified \"S\" Corporation in their stock of the qualified \"S\" Corporation shall be determined as if the election under subsection (G)(2) had not been made and each of the shareholders of the qualified \"S\" Corporation had properly taken into account each shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified \"S\" Corporation's items of income, loss, and deduction in the manner required with respect to an \"S\" Corporation for which no such election is in effect. The basis of a qualified partnership, including a limited liability company taxed as a partnership, shall be determined in the same manner.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 41, Section 1, eff April 14, 2005; 2006 Act No. 282, Section 1, eff May 23, 2006; 2006 Act No. 386, Section 5.A, eff for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2006; 2006 Act No. 386, Section 42, eff June 14, 2006; 2007 Act No. 110, Section 10.A, eff June 21, 2007, applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2005; 2007 Act No. 116, Section 16.A, eff June 28, 2007, applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2005; 2012 Act No. 287, Section 2, eff June 28, 2012; 2021 Act No. 61 (S.627), Section 1, eff May 17, 2021.",

In addition, if a taxpayer elects, pursuant to Section 164, to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes, the taxpayer may not deduct state and local sales and use taxes.\n\nThis modification is limited for individual taxpayers to the excess of itemized deductions over the standard deduction that would be allowed if the taxpayer had used the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.\n\n(3) For purposes of computing the deduction for estate taxes allowed by Internal Revenue Code Section 691(c), \"estate tax\" means the South Carolina Estate Tax including any South Carolina generation-skipping transfer tax.\n\n(4) A net operating loss deduction is computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code except that:\n\n(a) All items of income and deductions used in computing the net operating loss deduction are adjusted as provided in this article.\n\n(b) No carrybacks are allowed.\n\n(c) A federal election to carryback a net operating loss deduction does not affect the computation of this deduction for South Carolina income tax purposes.\n\n(d) A net operating loss is subject to allocation and apportionment under Article 17 of this chapter in the year the loss is incurred.\n\n(5) A corporation may not carry back a net capital loss as permitted by Internal Revenue Code Section 1212(a).

If upon review of the information provided, the department finds that the taxpayer's intercompany transactions lack economic substance or are not at fair market value, the department may redetermine the state net income of the taxpayer properly attributable to its business activity in this State under subsection (A) by: (i) adding back, eliminating, or otherwise adjusting intercompany transactions to accurately compute the taxpayer's state net income, or, if such adjustments are not adequate under the circumstances to redetermine state net income, (ii) requiring the taxpayer to file a return that reflects the net income on a combined basis of all members of its affiliated group that are conducting a unitary business. The department shall consider and be authorized to use any reasonable method proposed by the taxpayer for redetermining its state net income attributable to its business activity in this State. In determining whether the taxpayer's intercompany transactions lack economic substance or are not at fair market value, the department shall consider each taxable year separately.\n\n(3) Voluntary Redetermination. In addition to the authority granted under this subsection, if the department has reason to believe that any taxpayer's state net income properly attributable to its business activity in this State is not fairly represented on a separate return required by this subsection because of intercompany transactions, without making a finding that those transactions lack economic substance or are not at fair market value, the department and the taxpayer jointly may determine and agree to an alternative filing methodology that fairly represents state net income.\n\n(4) Combined Return. If the department finds that a combined return is required under the provisions of subsection (A) and this subsection, the department may, upon written notice to the taxpayer, require the taxpayer to submit the combined return, and the taxpayer shall submit the combined return within ninety days of the date of the notice. The submission by the taxpayer of the combined return required by the department must not be deemed to be a return or construed as an agreement by the taxpayer that an assessment based on the combined return is correct or that additional tax is due by the department's deadline for submitting the combined return. The department or the taxpayer may propose a combination of fewer than all members of the unitary group, and the department is authorized to consider whether such proposed combination is a reasonable means of redetermining state net income; provided, however, the department shall not require a combination of fewer than all members of the unitary group without the consent of the taxpayer.\n\n(5) Written Statement of Findings. If the department makes an adjustment or requires a combined return under this section, the department shall provide the taxpayer with a written statement containing details of the facts, circumstances, and reasons for which the department has found that the taxpayer did not fairly represent its state net income properly attributable to its business activity in this State and the department's proposed method for computation of the taxpayer's state net income no later than ninety days following the issuance of a proposed assessment as provided in this section.\n\n(6) Members of Affiliated Group. The department may require a combined return under this section regardless of whether the members of the affiliated group are or are not doing business in this State.\n\n(7) Economic Substance. A transaction has economic substance if: (i) the transaction, or the series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, has one or more reasonable business purposes other than the creation of state income tax benefits; and (ii) the transaction, or the series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, has economic effects beyond the creation of state income tax benefits. In determining whether a transaction has economic substance, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) Reasonable business purposes and economic effects include, but are not limited to, any material benefit from the transaction other than state income tax benefits not allowable under item (2).\n\n(b) In determining whether to require a combined return, whether the transaction has economic effects beyond the creation of state income tax benefits may be satisfied by demonstrating material business activity of the entities involved in the transaction.\n\n(c) If state income tax benefits resulting from a transaction, or a series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, are consistent with legislative intent, such state income tax benefits must be considered in determining whether the transaction has business purpose and economic substance.\n\n(d) Centralized cash management of an affiliated group as defined in item (10) shall not constitute evidence of an absence of economic substance.\n\n(e) Achieving a financial accounting benefit shall not be taken into account as a reasonable business purpose for entering into a transaction if the origin of such financial accounting benefit is a reduction of state income tax.\n\n(8) Allocation of Income and Deductions. In determining whether transactions between members of the affiliated group of entities are not at fair market value, the department shall apply the standards contained in the regulations adopted under Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(9) Apportionment. If the department requires a combined return under this section, the combined state net income of the taxpayer and the members of the affiliated group of entities must be apportioned to this State by use of an apportionment formula that fairly represents the extent of taxpayer's business activity in this State and which fairly reflects the apportionment formula in Section 12-6-2295 applicable to the taxpayer and each member of the affiliated group included in the combined return.\n\n(10) Affiliated Group Defined. For purposes of this section, an affiliated group is a group of two or more corporations or noncorporate entities in which more than fifty percent of the voting stock of each member corporation or ownership interest of each member noncorporate entity is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a common owner or owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member corporations or noncorporate entities. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to limit or negate the department's authority to add back, eliminate, or otherwise adjust intercompany transactions involving the listed entities to accurately compute the taxpayer's state net income properly attributable to its business activity in this State, as provided in this subsection.\n\nThe following entities must not be included in a combined return:\n\n(a) a taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return;\n\n(b) an insurance company, other than a captive insurance company: (i) which is subject to tax under Title 38; (ii) whose premiums are subject to tax under Chapter 7, Title 38 or a similar tax in another state; (iii) which is licensed as a reinsurance company; (iv) which is a life insurance company as defined in Section 816 of the Internal Revenue Code; or (v) which is an insurance company subject to tax imposed by Section 831 of the Internal Revenue Code. A \"captive insurance company\" means an insurer that is part of an affiliated group where the insurer receives more than fifty percent of its net written premiums or other amounts received as compensation for insurance from members of the affiliated group;\n\n(c) a taxpayer exempt from taxation under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(d) a foreign taxpayer as defined in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than a domestic branch thereof;\n\n(e) a taxpayer with at least eighty percent of its gross income from all sources in the tax year being active foreign business income as defined in Section 861(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect as of July 1, 2021;\n\n(f) any other entity not subject to tax under Section 12-6-530.\n\n(11) Proposed Assessment or Refund. If the department redetermines the state net income of the taxpayer in accordance with this section by adjusting the state net income of the taxpayer or requiring a combined return, the department shall issue a proposed assessment or refund upon making the redetermination. When a refund is determined in whole or part by a proposed assessment to an affiliated group member under this section, the refund may not be issued until the proposed assessment to the affiliated group member has become collectable. The amount of the refund shall reflect any changes made by the department under this section. Otherwise, the procedures for a proposed assessment or a refund in Chapter 60 are applicable to proposed assessments and refunds made under this section.\n\n(12) Penalties. If a combined return required by this section is not timely submitted by a taxpayer, then the taxpayer is subject to the penalties provided in Section 12-60-430. Penalties may not be imposed on an assessment under this section except as expressly authorized in this section.\n\n(13) Advice. A taxpayer may request in writing from the department specific advice regarding whether a redetermination of the taxpayer's state net income or a combined return would be required under this section under certain facts and circumstances. The department may request information from the taxpayer that is required to provide the specific advice. The department shall provide the specific advice within one hundred twenty days of the receipt of the requested information from the taxpayer. The department's advice under this item is not a department determination under the Revenue Procedures Act.\n\n(14) Extension. The department and the taxpayer may extend any time limit contained in this subsection by mutual agreement.\n\n(15) Other Tax Adjustments. Nothing in this section may be construed to limit or negate the department's authority to make tax adjustments as otherwise permitted by law.\n\n(16) Appeals. If the taxpayer appeals a final determination by the department under this section to the Administrative Law Court in a contested tax case, the administrative law judge shall review de novo: (i) whether the separate income tax returns submitted by the taxpayer fail to fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this State through the use of intercompany transactions that lack economic substance or are not at fair market value between members of an affiliated group of entities; (ii) whether the department's means of determining the taxpayer's state net income under this section is an appropriate means of determining the taxpayer's state net income properly attributable to this State; and (iii) if a combined return is required by the department, whether adjustments other than requiring the taxpayer to file a return on a combined basis are adequate under the circumstances to redetermine state net income.\n\n(C)(1) For the purposes of this chapter, the department may enter into an agreement with the taxpayer establishing the allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income for a period not to exceed five years, if the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) the taxpayer is planning a new facility in this State or an expansion of an existing facility;\n\n(b) the taxpayer asks the department to enter into a contract under this subsection reciting an allocation and apportionment method; and\n\n(c) after reviewing the taxpayer's proposal and planned new facility or expansion, the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development certifies that the new facility or expansion will have a significant beneficial economic effect on the region for which it is planned and that its benefits to the public exceed its costs to the public. It is within the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development's sole discretion to determine whether a new facility or expansion has a significant economic effect on the region for which it is planned.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection the word \"taxpayer\" includes any one or more of the members of a controlled group of corporations authorized to file a consolidated return under Section 12-6-5020. Also, the word \"taxpayer\" includes a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer as described in Section 267(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (1), the department may enter into an agreement with the taxpayer establishing the allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income for a period not to exceed ten years if the following conditions are met:\n\n(a)(i) the taxpayer is planning a new facility in this State or an expansion of an existing facility and the new or expanded facility results in a total investment of at least ten million dollars and the creation of at least two hundred new full-time jobs, with an average cash compensation level for the new jobs of more than three times the per capita income of this State at the time the jobs are filled which must be within five years of the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development's certification. Per capita income for the State shall be determined by using the most recent data available from the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office; or\n\n(ii) the taxpayer is planning a new facility in this State and invests at least seven hundred fifty million dollars in real or personal property or both in a single county in this State and creates at least three thousand eight hundred full-time new jobs, as those terms are defined in Section 12-6-3360(M), within the county. The taxpayer has seven years from the date it makes the notification provided for in subitem (b) of this item to make the required investment and create the required number of jobs;\n\n(b) the taxpayer asks the department to enter into a contract under this subsection reciting an allocation and apportionment method; and\n\n(c) after reviewing the taxpayer's proposal and planned new facility or expansion, the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development certifies that the new facility or expansion will have a significant beneficial economic effect on the region for which it is planned and that its benefits to the public exceed its costs to the public. It is within the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development's sole discretion to determine whether a new facility or expansion has a significant economic effect on the region for which it is planned.\n\n(4) The taxpayer may begin operating under the agreement beginning with the tax year in which the agreement is executed. If the taxpayer fails to meet the requirements of subitem (3)(a)(ii), the department may assess any tax due as a result of the taxpayer's failure to meet the requirements of subitem (3)(a)(ii). For any subsequent year that the taxpayer fails to maintain three thousand eight hundred full-time new jobs, then the department may assess any tax due for that year.\n\n(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a taxpayer who is constructing or operating a qualified recycling facility as defined in Section 12-6-3460 may petition the department for the use of separate accounting with respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's or taxpayer's subsidiaries' business activities or for the use of any other method to determine the taxpayer's or taxpayer's subsidiaries' taxable income. The department shall forward the petition with its comments concerning the economic impact of the suggested method to the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development. The department may approve the petition upon certification of the Advisory Coordinating Council for Economic Development that the benefits to the public exceed the costs to the public.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 76, Section 1; 1996 Act No. 462, Section 8A; 1999 Act No. 100, Part II, Section 57; 2009 Act No. 124, Section 1.A, eff November 1, 2009; 2024 Act No. 113 (S.298), Section 1, eff March 11, 2024.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no more than twelve counties may be designated or classified as \"Tier IV\" and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a county may be designated as \"Tier IV\" only by virtue of the criteria provided in this item.\n\n(2) The twelve counties with a combination of the next highest unemployment rate and next lowest per capita income are designated \"Tier III\" counties.\n\n(3) The eleven counties with a combination of the next highest unemployment rate and the next lowest per capita income are designated \"Tier II\" counties.\n\n(4) The eleven counties with a combination of the lowest unemployment rate and the highest per capita income are designated \"Tier I\" counties.\n\n(C)(1) Subject to the conditions provided in subsection (M) of this section, a job tax credit is allowed for five years beginning in year two after the creation of the job for each new full-time job created if the minimum level of new jobs is maintained. The credit is available to taxpayers that increase employment by ten or more full-time jobs, and no credit is allowed for the year or any subsequent year in which the net employment increase falls below the minimum level of ten. The amount of the initial job credit is as follows:\n\n(a) twenty-five thousand dollars for each new full-time job created in \"Tier IV\" counties.\n\n(b) twenty thousand two hundred fifty dollars for each new full-time job created in \"Tier III\" counties.\n\n(c) two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars for each new full-time job created in \"Tier II\" counties.\n\n(d) one thousand five hundred dollars for each new full-time job created in \"Tier I\" counties.\n\n(2)(a) Subject to the conditions provided in subsection (M) of this section, a job tax credit is allowed for five years beginning in year two after the creation of the job for each new full-time job created if the minimum level of new jobs is maintained. The credit is available to taxpayers with ninety-nine or fewer employees that increase employment by two or more full-time jobs, and may be received only if the gross wages of the full-time jobs created pursuant to this section amount to a minimum of one hundred twenty percent of the county's or state's average per capita income, whichever is lower. No credit is allowed for the year or any subsequent year in which the net employment increase falls below the minimum level of two. The amount of the initial job credit is as described in subsection (C)(1).\n\n(b) If the taxpayer with ninety-nine or fewer employees increases employment by two or more full-time jobs but the gross wages do not amount to a minimum one hundred twenty percent of the county's or state's average per capita income, whichever is lower, then the amount of the initial job credit is reduced by fifty percent.\n\n(D) If the taxpayer qualifying for the new jobs credit under subsection (C) creates additional new full-time jobs in years two through six, the taxpayer may obtain a credit for those new jobs for five years following the year in which the job is created. The amount of the credit for each new full-time job is the same as provided in subsection (C).\n\n(E)(1) Taxpayers which qualify for the job tax credit provided in subsection (C) and which are located in a business or industrial park jointly established and developed by a group of counties pursuant to Section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution of this State are allowed an additional one thousand dollar credit for each new full-time job created. This additional credit is permitted for five years beginning in the taxable year following the creation of the job.\n\n(2) Taxpayers which otherwise qualify for the job tax credit provided in subsection (C) and which are located and the qualifying jobs are located on property where a response action has been completed pursuant to a nonresponsible party voluntary cleanup contract pursuant to Article 7, Chapter 56, Title 44, the Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup Program, are allowed an additional one thousand dollar credit for each new full-time job created. This additional credit is permitted for five years beginning in the taxable year following the creation of the job. No credit under this item is allowed a taxpayer that is a \"responsible party\" as defined in that article.\n\n(F)(1) The number of new and additional new full-time jobs is determined by comparing the monthly average number of full-time employees subject to South Carolina income tax withholding in the applicable county for the taxable year with the monthly average in the prior taxable year. For purposes of calculating the monthly average number of full-time employees in the first year of operation in this State, a taxpayer may use the actual months in operation or a full twelve-month period. If a taxpayer's business is in operation for less than twelve months a year, the number of new and additional new full-time jobs is determined using the monthly average for the months the business is in operation.\n\n(2)(a) A taxpayer who makes a capital investment of at least fifty million dollars at a single site within a three-year period may elect to have the number of new and additional new full-time jobs determined by comparing the monthly average number of full-time jobs subject to South Carolina income tax withholding at the site for the taxable year with the monthly average for the prior taxable year.\n\n(b) For purposes of this item, \"single site\" means a stand-alone building whether or not several stand-alone buildings are located in one geographical location.\n\n(c) The calculation of new and additional jobs provided for in this item is allowed for only a five-year period commencing in the year in which the fifty million dollars of capital investment is completed.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subsection a \"new job\" does not include a job transferred from one site to another site by the taxpayer or a related person. A related person includes any entity or person that bears a relationship to the taxpayer as set forth in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(G) Except for credits carried forward under subsection (H), the credits available under this section are only allowed for the job level that is maintained in the taxable year that the credit is claimed. If the job level for which a credit was claimed decreases, the five-year period for eligibility for the credit continues to run.\n\n(H) A credit claimed pursuant to this section but not used in a taxable year may be carried forward for fifteen years from the taxable year in which the credit is earned by the taxpayer. Credits that are carried forward must be used in the order earned and before jobs credits claimed in the current year. A taxpayer who earns credits allowed by this section and who also is eligible for the moratorium provided in Section 12-6-3367 may claim the credits and may carry forward unused credits beginning after the moratorium period expires.\n\n(I) The merger, consolidation, or reorganization of a taxpayer, where tax attributes survive, does not create new eligibility in a succeeding taxpayer, but unused job tax credits may be transferred and continued by the succeeding taxpayer subject to the limitations of Section 12-6-3320. In addition, a taxpayer may assign its rights to its jobs tax credit to another taxpayer if it transfers all or substantially all of the assets of the taxpayer or all or substantially all of the assets of a trade or business or operating division of a taxpayer related to the generation of the jobs tax credits to that taxpayer if the required number of new jobs is maintained for that amount of credit. A taxpayer is not allowed a jobs tax credit if the net employment increase for that taxpayer falls below two. The appropriate agency shall determine if qualifying net increases or decreases have occurred and may require reports, adopt rules or promulgate regulations, and hold hearings needed for substantiation and qualification.\n\n(J) For a taxpayer which plans a significant expansion in its labor forces at a location in this State, the appropriate agency shall prescribe certification procedures to ensure that the taxpayer can claim credits in future years even if a particular county is removed from the list of \"Tier IV\", \"Tier III\", or \"Tier II\" counties.\n\n(K)(1) An \"S\" corporation, limited liability company taxed as a partnership, or partnership that qualifies for a credit under this section may pass through the credit earned to each shareholder of the \"S\" corporation, partner of the partnership, or member of the limited liability company. For purposes of this subsection, limited liability company means a limited liability company taxed as a partnership.\n\n(2)(a) The amount of the credit allowed a shareholder, partner, or member by this subsection is equal to the shareholder's percentage of stock ownership, partner's interest in the partnership, or member's interest in the limited liability company for the taxable year multiplied by the amount of the credit earned by the entity. This nonrefundable credit is allowed against taxes due under Section 12-6-510 or 12-6-530 and bank taxes imposed pursuant to Chapter 11 of this title and may not exceed fifty percent of the shareholder's, partner's, or member's tax liability under Section 12-6-510 or 12-6-530 or bank tax liability imposed pursuant to Chapter 11 of this title.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subitem (a), the credit earned pursuant to this section by an \"S\" corporation owing corporate level income tax must be used first at the entity level. Only the remaining credit passes through to each shareholder.\n\n(3) A credit claimed pursuant to this subsection but not used in a taxable year may be carried forward by each shareholder, partner, or member for fifteen years from the close of the tax year in which the credit is earned by the \"S\" corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. The entity earning the credit may not carry over credit that passes through to its shareholders, partners, or members.\n\n(L) Reserved.\n\n(M) As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"Taxpayer\" means a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation of any classification, limited liability company, or association taxable as a business entity that is subject to South Carolina taxes as contained in Section 12-6-510, Section 12-6-530, Chapter 11, Title 12, or Chapter 7, Title 38.\n\n(2) \"Appropriate agency\" means the Department of Revenue, except that for taxpayers subject to the premium tax imposed by Chapter 7, Title 38, it means the Department of Insurance.\n\n(3) \"New job\" means a job created in this State at the time a new facility or an expansion is initially staffed. Except as otherwise provided in this item, the term does not include a job created when an employee is shifted from an existing location in this State to a new or expanded facility whether the transferred job is from, or to, a facility of the taxpayer or a related person. However, for a professional sports team, \"new job\" means all jobs located at the professional sports team park regardless of whether an employee previously worked at an existing location in this State before 2019 as an employee of the same professional sports team. A related person includes any entity or person that bears a relationship to the taxpayer as described in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, this exclusion of a new job created by employee shifting does not extend to a job created at a new or expanded facility located in a county in which is located an \"applicable federal facility\" as defined in Section 12-6-3450(A)(1)(b). The term \"new job\" also includes an existing job at a facility of an employer which is reinstated after the employer has rebuilt the facility due to:\n\n(a) its destruction by accidental fire, natural disaster, or act of God;\n\n(b) involuntary conversion as a result of condemnation or exercise of eminent domain by the State or any of its political subdivisions or by the federal government.\n\nDestruction for purposes of this provisionmeans that more than fifty percent of the facility was destroyed. For purposes of this section, involuntary conversion as a result of condemnation or exercise of eminent domain includes a legally binding agreement for the purchase of a facility of an employer entered into between an employer and the State of South Carolina or a political subdivision of the State under threat of exercise of eminent domain by the State or its political subdivision.\n\nThe year of reinstatement is the year of creation of the job. All reinstated jobs qualify for the credit pursuant to this section, and a comparison is not required to be made between the number of full-time jobs of the employer in the taxable year and the number of full-time jobs of the employer with the corresponding period of the prior taxable year.\n\n(4) \"Full-time\" means a job requiring a minimum of thirty-five hours of an employee's time a week for the entire normal year of company operations or a job requiring a minimum of thirty-five hours of an employee's time for a week for a year in which the employee was hired initially for or transferred to the South Carolina facility. For members of a professional sports team, \"full-time\" means a job requiring a minimum of one hundred eighty days of an employee's time a year of which at least eighty percent of such days must be spent at a professional sports team park located in South Carolina. For the purposes of this section, two half-time jobs are considered one full-time job. A \"half-time job\" is a job requiring a minimum of twenty hours of an employee's time a week for the entire normal year of the company's operations or a job requiring a minimum of twenty hours of an employee's time a week for a year in which the employee was hired initially for or transferred to the South Carolina facility. For agricultural packaging and agribusiness operations, seasonal workers may be considered a full-time employee; however, a seasonal employee only counts as a fraction of a full-time worker, with the numerator being the number of hours worked a week multiplied by the number of weeks worked, and the denominator being the number one thousand eight hundred twenty.\n\n(5) \"Manufacturing facility\" means an establishment where tangible personal property is produced or assembled.\n\n(6) \"Processing facility\" means an establishment that prepares, treats, or converts tangible personal property into finished goods or another form of tangible personal property.

The term does not include an establishment where retail sales of tangible personal property are made to retail customers on more than twelve days a year except for a facility which processes customer sales orders by mail, telephone, or electronic means, if the facility also processes shipments of tangible personal property to customers and if at least seventy-five percent of the dollar amount of goods sold through the facility are sold to customers outside of South Carolina. Retail sales made inside the facility to employees working at the facility are not considered for purposes of the twelve-day and seventy-five percent limitation. For purposes of this definition, \"retail sale\" and \"tangible personal property\" have the meaning provided in Chapter 36 of this title.\n\n(9) \"Research and development facility\" means an establishment engaged in laboratory, scientific, or experimental testing and development related to new products, new uses for existing products, or improving existing products. The term does not include an establishment engaged in efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, economic surveys, advertising, promotion, banking, or research in connection with literary, historical, or similar projects.\n\n(10) \"Corporate office facility\" means a corporate headquarters that meets the definition of a \"corporate headquarters\" contained in Section 12-6-3410(J)(1). The corporate headquarters of a general contractor licensed by the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation qualifies even if it is not a regional or national headquarters as those terms are defined in Section 12-6-3410(J)(1).\n\n(11) The terms \"retail sales\" and \"tangible personal property\" for purposes of this section are defined in Chapter 36 of this title.\n\n(12) \"Tourism facility\" means an establishment used for a theme park; amusement park; historical, educational, or trade museum; botanical garden; cultural center; theater; motion picture production studio; convention center; arena; auditorium; or a spectator or participatory sports facility; and similar establishments where entertainment, education, or recreation is provided to the general public.

Determination of the required number of jobs is in accordance with the monthly average described in subsection (F).\n\n(14) \"Technology intensive facility\" means:\n\n(a) a facility at which a firm engages in the design, development, and introduction of new products or innovative manufacturing processes, or both, through the systematic application of scientific and technical knowledge.

The department shall provide the report to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Governor beginning on May first of the year immediately following the year in which the first new full-time job is created by the professional sports team, and on May first each year thereafter.

Loss of the moratorium in one county due to job reduction does not impact the moratorium for income attributable to facilities in the other county.\n\n(C) During the applicable moratorium period, the moratorium applies to that portion of the taxpayer's corporate income or premium tax that represents the ratio of the taxpayer's new investment in the qualifying county or counties to its total investment in this State.\n\n(D) The department shall prescribe certification procedures to ensure that the taxpayer may claim the moratorium in future years even if a particular county is removed from the list of qualifying counties.\n\n(E)(1) If the taxpayer creates and maintains at least two hundred full-time new jobs at the facility specified in subsection (B)(1)(a) within five years from the date the taxpayer creates the first full-time new job at the facility, the moratorium period is fifteen taxable years, beginning the first full taxable year after the taxpayer qualifies and ending either fifteen years from that year or the year when the taxpayer's number of full-time new jobs falls below two hundred, whichever is earlier.\n\n(2) If the taxpayer creates and maintains at least two hundred full-time new jobs at facilities in either or both of the counties specified in subsection (B)(1)(b) within five years from the date the taxpayer creates the first full-time new job in either of the counties, the moratorium period is fifteen taxable years with respect to income attributable to facilities in the county or counties where the taxpayer qualifies, beginning the first full taxable year after the taxpayer qualifies in a respective county and ending either fifteen years from that year or the year when the taxpayer's number of full-time new jobs in the respective county fall below two hundred, whichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxpayer qualifies in one or more counties for the fifteen-year period specified in this subsection and subsequently within the ten-year period specified in subsection (A) reduces the number of jobs at any such facility to fewer than two hundred but more than one hundred, the taxpayer is entitled to the moratorium with respect to such facility for the balance of the ten-year period. Loss of the fifteen-year period in one county described in subsection (B)(1)(b) due to job reduction does not impact the fifteen-year period for income attributable to facilities in the other county.\n\n(F) The taxpayer must create the one hundred full-time new jobs within five years from the date it creates the first full-time new job in the county specified in subsections (B)(1)(a)(i).\n\n(G) Any moratorium allowed under subsection (B)(1)(b) is not affected if the taxpayer changes its form of business organization within the ten- or fifteen-year moratorium period.\n\n(H) For purposes of qualification under subsection (B)(1)(b) and all related provisions, the term \"taxpayer\" means a single taxpayer or, collectively, a group of one or more affiliated taxpayers.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 297, Section 1, eff May 31, 2006.",

The credits may be claimed against the taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 12-6-530 and 12-6-545 and against employee withholdings. The council has sole discretion in allocating the credits provided by this section and must consider the following factors:\n\n(a) the amount of base year port cargo volume;\n\n(b) the total and percentage increase in port cargo volume; and\n\n(c) factors related to the economic benefit of the State or other factors.\n\n(3)(a) If the income tax credit exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year, the excess amount may be carried forward and claimed against income taxes in the next five succeeding taxable years.\n\n(b) If the credit against withholding taxes exceeds the taxpayer's withholding tax liability for the taxable quarter that is not otherwise refunded under Title 12 of the 1976 Code, the excess amount may be carried forward and claimed against withholding liability that is not otherwise refunded under Title 12 of the 1976 in the next twenty succeeding taxable quarters.\n\n(B)(1) For every year in which a taxpayer claims the credit, the taxpayer shall submit an application to the council after the calendar year in which the increase in port cargo volume occurs. Allocations of the credit may be made on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The taxpayer shall attach a schedule to the taxpayer's application to the council with the following information and information requested by the council or the department:\n\n(a) a description of how the base year port cargo volume and the increase in port cargo volume was determined;\n\n(b) the amount of the base year port cargo volume;\n\n(c) the amount of the increase in port cargo volume for the taxable year stated both as a percentage increase and as a total increase in net tons of non-containerized cargo, measurement of cargo, and TEUs of cargo, including information which demonstrates an increase in port cargo volume in excess of the minimum amount required to claim the tax credits pursuant to this section;\n\n(d) any tax credit utilized by the taxpayer in prior years; and\n\n(e) the amount of tax credit carried over from prior years.\n\n(2) To receive the credit the taxpayer shall claim the credit on its income tax or withholding return in a manner prescribed by the department. The department may require a copy of the certification form issued by the council be attached to the return or otherwise provided.\n\n(C) As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"TEU\" means a twenty-foot equivalent unit; a volumetric measure based on the size of a container twenty feet long by eight feet wide by eight feet, six inches high. A \"weighted TEU\" is equal to seven and one-half tons. A \"measured TEU\" is equal to thirty-eight and one-half cubic meters.\n\n(2) \"Base year port cargo volume\" initially means the total amount of net tons of non-containerized cargo, measured equivalent of non-cargo or TEUs of cargo actually transported by way of a waterborne ship through a port facility during the period from January first through December thirty-first of the same year. Base year port cargo volume must be at least seventy-five net tons of non-containerized cargo, three hundred eighty-five cubic meters, or ten TEUs for a taxpayer to be eligible for the credits provided in this section. For a taxpayer that does not ship that amount in the year ending December thirty-first of the previous year, including a taxpayer who locates in South Carolina after December thirty-first of the previous year, its base cargo volume will be measured by the initial January first through December thirty-first calendar year in which it meets the requirements of seventy-five net tons of non-containerized cargo, three hundred eighty-five cubic meters, or ten loaded TEUs. Base year port cargo volume must be recalculated each calendar year after the initial base year.\n\n(3) \"Port facility\" means any publicly or privately owned facility located within this State through which cargo is transported by way of a waterborne ship or vehicle to or from destinations outside this State and which handles cargo owned by third parties in addition to cargo owned by the port facility's owner.\n\n(4) \"Port cargo volume\" means the total amount of net tons of non-containerized cargo or containers measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of cargo transported by way of a waterborne ship or vehicle through a port facility, or measured cubic meters of cargo.\n\n(D) The council annually may award up to one million dollars of the fifteen million dollars of credits against employee withholdings that are not otherwise refundable pursuant to this title to a new warehouse or distribution facility which commits to expending at least forty million dollars at a single site and creating one hundred new full-time jobs, and the base year cargo may not be less than five thousand TEUs or its non-containerized equivalent. The council may make the award in the year the facility is announced provided that it may not tender the certificate until it has received satisfactory proof that the capital investment and job creation requirements have, or will be, satisfied. Any credit certificate expires three years after issuance if satisfactory proof has not been received. If the credit exceeds the taxpayer's withholding tax liability for the taxable quarter that is not otherwise refundable pursuant to this title, the excess amount may be carried forward and claimed against withholding liability that is not otherwise refundable pursuant to this title in the next twenty succeeding taxable quarters.\n\n(E)(1) A taxpayer engaged in the movement of goods imported or exported through South Carolina's port facilities may be eligible for the port volume tax credit if the cargo supports a presence in the State and the taxpayer does not have a distribution center in the State at the time of initial approval of the port volume tax credit, so long as:\n\n(a) the taxpayer employs at least two hundred and fifty full-time or full-time equivalent South Carolinians in operations statewide;\n\n(b) the taxpayer completes the construction of the distribution facility in South Carolina, and is operational, within five years of the initial approval of the port volume tax credit; and\n\n(c) the base year for the taxpayer shall be not less than five thousand TEUs or its non-containerized equivalent.\n\n(2) Any credit certificate expires three years after issuance if satisfactory proof has not been received.\n\n(F) The council has discretion to award the credits pursuant to either subsection (D) or (E).\n\n(G) Notwithstanding Section 12-54-240, the department and the Department of Commerce may exchange information submitted by a taxpayer pursuant to this section.\n\n(H)(1) If a taxpayer receives the credit under subsection (D) but fails to meet the requirements of subsection (D) at the end of the three-year period, the taxpayer must repay the department a pro rata portion of the credits claimed.\n\n(2) If a taxpayer receives the credit under subsection (E) but fails to meet the requirements of subsection (E)(1) at the end of the five-year period, the taxpayer must repay the department a pro rata portion of the credits claimed.\n\n(I)(1) A taxpayer engaged in any of the businesses identified in subsection (A)(1) at a facility located in this State is eligible to claim a port transportation credit or a port volume cargo credit in the form of an income tax credit or a credit against employee withholding in an amount determined by the council in its sole discretion, except that the port transportation credit must be based on the taxpayer's transportation costs. A taxpayer may not claim both the port transportation credit and the port volume cargo credit in the same tax year.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, \"transportation costs\" means the costs of transporting freight, goods, and materials to and from port facilities in South Carolina.\n\n(3) The maximum amount of port transportation credits allowed to all qualifying taxpayers pursuant to this subsection is limited to the following amounts of the fifteen million dollars of credits available under this section:\n\n(a) one million dollars for the calendar year ending December 31, 2019;\n\n(b) two million dollars for the calendar year ending December 31, 2020; and\n\n(c) three million dollars for all calendar years after December 31, 2020, until the port transportation credit expires pursuant to item (6).\n\n(4)(a) If the allocable port transportation credit exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year, the excess amount may be carried forward and claimed against income taxes in the next five succeeding taxable years.\n\n(b) If the allocable port transportation credit exceeds the taxpayer's withholding tax liability for the taxable quarter that is not otherwise refundable pursuant to this title, the excess amount may be carried forward and claimed against withholding liability that is not otherwise refundable pursuant to this title in the next twenty succeeding taxable quarters.\n\n(5)(a) The port transportation credit is allowable to a qualifying taxpayer without regard to whether the taxpayer qualifies for any of the other credits available under this section. A qualifying taxpayer seeking to claim the port transportation credit must submit an application to the council after the calendar year in which the taxpayer seeks to claim the port transportation credit. The application must be made on a form to be prescribed by the council.\n\n(b) To receive the credit the taxpayer shall claim the credit on its income tax or withholding return in a manner prescribed by the department. The department may require a copy of the certification form issued by the council be attached to the return or otherwise provided.\n\n(6) A taxpayer may not claim the port transportation credit in any tax year after the tax year in which a port in Jasper County is opened and is accepting shipments.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 124, Section 1, eff June 3, 2005; 2006 Act No. 384, Section 6, eff June 14, 2006; 2006 Act No. 386, Section 10.A, eff June 14, 2006 applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2004; 2010 Act No. 290, Section 17, eff January 1, 2011; 2013 Act No. 81, Section 1, eff June 13, 2013; 2019 Act No. 37 (S.439), Sections 1, 2, eff May 13, 2019.",
