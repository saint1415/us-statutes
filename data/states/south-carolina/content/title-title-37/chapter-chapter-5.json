In addition, the consumer has a cause of action to recover actual damages and, in an action other than a class action, a right to recover from the person violating this section a penalty in the amount determined by the court of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (3), the term \"collecting a debt\" in a consumer credit transaction includes the collection or the attempt to collect any rental charge or any other fee or charge or any item rented to a lessee in connection with a consumer rental-purchase agreement as described in Section 37-2-701(6).\n\n(3) If it is claimed or appears to the court that the agreement or transaction or any term or part thereof may be unconscionable, or that a person has engaged in, is engaging in, or is likely to engage in unconscionable conduct in collecting a debt, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the agreement or transaction or term or part thereof, or of the conduct, to aid the court in making the determination.\n\n(4)(a) In applying subsection (1), consideration must be given to applicable factors, such as, but without limitation:\n\n(i) in the case of a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, or consumer rental-purchase agreement, knowledge by the seller or lessor at the time of the sale or lease of the inability of the consumer to receive substantial benefits from the property or services sold or leased;\n\n(ii) in the case of a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, consumer rental-purchase agreement, or consumer loan, gross disparity between the price of the property or services sold, leased, or loaned and the value of the property, services, or loan measured by the price at which similar property, services, or loans are readily obtainable in consumer credit transactions by like consumers;\n\n(iii) the fact that the creditor contracted for or received separate charges for insurance with respect to a consumer credit sale, consumer loan, or consumer rental-purchase agreement with the effect of making the sale or loan unconscionable, considered as a whole, when including the sale of insurance from which the consumer receives no potential benefit as referenced in Section 37-4-106(1)(a);\n\n(iv) the fact that the seller, lessor, or lender knowingly has taken advantage of the inability of the consumer or debtor reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors;\n\n(v) taking a nonpurchase money, nonpossessory security interest in household goods defined as the following: clothing, furniture, appliances, one radio and one television, linens, china, crockery, kitchenware, and personal effects, including wedding rings of the consumer and his dependents; except that when a purchase money consumer credit transaction is refinanced or consolidated, the security lawfully collateralizing the previous consumer credit transaction continues to secure the new consumer credit transaction, even if the new consumer credit transaction is for a larger amount or is in other respects a nonpurchase money consumer credit transaction; and further, that a nonpurchase money, nonpossessory security interest may be taken in a work of art, electronic entertainment equipment, except one television and one radio, items acquired as antiques and which are over one hundred years of age, and jewelry, except wedding rings.\n\nIn construing subitem (v), the courts must be guided by the interpretations and rulings of the federal courts and the Federal Trade Commission to the Credit Trade Regulation Rule (16 C.F.R. PART 444).\n\n(b) In applying subsection (1), consideration may be given to the extension of credit to a consumer if, considering the consumer's current and expected income, current obligations, and employment status, the creditor knows or should know that the consumer is unable to make the scheduled payment on the obligation when due. Rental renewals necessary to acquire ownership in a consumer rental-purchase agreement are not obligations contemplated in this item (b).\n\n(5) In applying subsection (2), consideration shall be given to each of the following factors, among others, as applicable:\n\n(a) using or threatening to use force, violence, or criminal prosecution against the consumer or members of his family, including harm to the physical person, reputation, or property of any person;\n\n(b) communicating with the consumer or a member of his family at frequent intervals during a twenty-four hour period or at unusual hours or under other circumstances so that it is a reasonable inference that the primary purpose of the communication was to harass the consumer. The term \"communication\" means the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium. A creditor or debt collector may not:\n\n(i) communicate with a consumer at any unusual time or place known or which should be known to be inconvenient to the consumer. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, it may be assumed that a convenient time to communicate with a consumer is between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.; or\n\n(ii) communicate with a consumer who is represented by an attorney when such fact is known to the creditor or debt collector unless the attorney consents to direct communication or fails to respond within ten days to a communication;\n\n(iii) contact a consumer at his place of employment after the consumer or his employer has requested in writing that no contacts be made at such place of employment or except as may be otherwise permitted by statute or to verify the consumer's employment;\n\n(iv) communicate with anyone other than the consumer, his attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the attorney of the creditor or debt collector, unless the consumer or a court of competent jurisdiction has given prior direct permission;\n\n(v) use obscene or profane language or language the natural consequence of which is to abuse the hearer or reader;\n\n(vi) publish a list of consumers who allegedly refuse to pay debts, except to a consumer reporting agency;\n\n(vii) cause a telephone to ring repeatedly during a twenty-four hour period or engage any person in a telephone conversation with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number;\n\n(viii) advertise for sale any debt to coerce payment of the debt;\n\n(ix) communicate with a consumer regarding a debt by postcard;\n\n(x) deposit or threaten to deposit any postdated check or other postdated payment instrument requested by the creditor prior to the date on such check or instrument;\n\n(xi) take or threaten to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property if:\n\n(aa) there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral through an enforceable security interest or other ownership interest;\n\n(bb) there is no present intention to take possession of the property; or\n\n(cc) the property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement; or\n\n(xii) cause charges to be incurred by any person for communications to the consumer by concealment of the true purpose of the communication, such charges include, but are not limited to, collect telephone calls and telegram fees.\n\n(c) using fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with the collection of a consumer credit transaction. Such false representations shall include:\n\n(i) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt;\n\n(ii) any services rendered or fees which may be received, unless such fees are expressly authorized by law;\n\n(iii) a claim of an individual that he is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney;\n\n(iv) any claim or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in arrest, imprisonment, garnishment, seizure, or attachment unless the remedy is legally permitted to the creditor and the claim or implication is not used for the purpose of harassment or abuse of process;\n\n(v) a claim or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct to disgrace the consumer; or\n\n(vi) any written communication which simulates or appears to be a document authorized, issued, or approved by any state or federal agency or court or creates a false impression as to its source;\n\n(d) causing or threatening to cause injury to the consumer's reputation or economic status by disclosing information affecting the consumer's reputation for creditworthiness with knowledge or reason to know that the information is false; communicating with the consumer's employer before obtaining a final judgment against the consumer, except as permitted by statute or to verify the consumer's employment; disclosing to a person, with knowledge or reason to know that the person does not have a legitimate business need for the information, or in any way prohibited by statute, information affecting the consumer's credit or other reputation; or disclosing information concerning the existence of a debt known to be disputed by the consumer without disclosing that fact;\n\n(e) engaging in conduct with knowledge that like conduct has been restrained or enjoined by a court in a civil action by the administrator against any person pursuant to the provisions on injunctions against fraudulent or unconscionable agreements or conduct (Section 37-6-111).\n\n(6) No action at law claiming unconscionable debt collection may be commenced in any court until at least thirty days after the facts and circumstances of any claim of unconscionable conduct in collecting a debt arising out of a consumer credit transaction has been filed in writing with the administrator of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The administrator shall immediately provide to the person or organization complained against with a copy of any complaint alleging unconscionable debt collection practices filed with the Department of Consumer Affairs. The administrator shall immediately provide to the Director of the Consumer Finance Division of the Board of Financial Institutions a copy of any written claim of unconscionable conduct in collecting a debt filed against a supervised lender under this title or a restricted lender under Title 34. A creditor or debt collector may only take such action as is authorized by law to protect its collateral during the thirty-day state agency review period. The administrator shall take immediate steps to investigate, evaluate, and attempt to resolve such complaints. The administrator and director shall jointly take immediate steps to investigate, evaluate, and attempt to resolve complaints involving supervised and restricted lenders. If in an action, properly filed after the thirty-day state agency review period with regard to conduct in collecting a debt arising out of a consumer credit transaction, in which unconscionability is claimed the court finds unconscionability pursuant to subsection (1) or (2), the court shall award reasonable fees to the attorney for the consumer or debtor. If the court does not find unconscionability and the consumer or debtor claiming unconscionability has brought or maintained an action he knew to be groundless, the court may award reasonable fees to the attorney for the party against whom the claim is made. In determining attorney's fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the consumer is not controlling.\n\n(7) The remedies of this section are in addition to remedies available for the same conduct under law other than this title.\n\n(8) For the purpose of this section, a charge or practice expressly permitted by this title is not in itself unconscionable.\n\n(9) Nothing in this title may be construed to prevent a finding of unconscionability where a creditor assesses an origination charge, prepaid finance charge, service, or other prepaid charge which substantially exceeds the usual and customary charge for the particular type of consumer credit transaction. In such a transaction the court shall consider the relative sophistication of the debtor and the creditor, the relative bargaining power of the debtor and creditor, and any oral or written representations made by the creditor regarding the credit service charge or the loan finance charge of the consumer credit transaction.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-800.338; 1974 (58) 2879; 1976 Act No. 686 Section 38; 1982 Act No. 385, Section 43; 1985 Act No. 121, Sections 10, 11; 1985 Act No. 153, Sections 3, 4; 1995 Act No. 135, Section 17; 2003 Act No. 42, Section 4, eff Jan. 1, 2004, and applying to loans for which the loan applications were taken on or after that date.",

Until expiration of the minimum applicable period after the notice is given, the consumer may cure all defaults consisting of a failure to make the required payment by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Cure restores the consumer to his rights under the agreement as though the defaults had not occurred.\n\n(2) With respect to defaults on the same obligation and subject to subsection (1), after a creditor has once given notice of consumer's right to cure (Section 37-5-110), this section gives the consumer no right to cure and imposes no limitation on the creditor's right to proceed against the consumer or goods that are collateral or which are rented or the lessor's right to recover the property. For the purpose of this section, in credit extended pursuant to a revolving charge or revolving loan account, the obligation is the unpaid balance of the account and there is no right to cure and no limitation on the creditor's rights with respect to a default that occurs within twelve months after an earlier default as to which a creditor has given a notice of consumer's right to cure (Section 37-5-110).\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), with respect to consumer rental-purchase agreements, with payments or options to renew which are monthly or less frequent than monthly, after a default consisting of failure to renew and failure to return the property, a lessor may not instigate court action to recover rented property until five days after the notice of the consumer's right to cure (Section 37-5-110) is given.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1), with respect to consumer rental-purchase agreements with payments or options to renew more frequently than monthly, after default consisting of failure to renew or return the property, a lessor may not instigate court action to recover rented property until three days after notice of the consumer's right to cure (Section 37-5-110) is given.\n\n(5) With respect to all consumer rental-purchase agreements until expiration of the minimum applicable period after notice is given, the consumer may cure all defaults consisting of failure to renew and failure to return the property by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the same time of the tender plus any unpaid delinquency charges or other charges authorized by Part 7, Chapter 2.\n\n(6) This section and the provisions on waiver, agreements to forego rights, and settlement of claims (Section 37-1-107) do not prohibit a consumer from voluntarily surrendering possession of goods which are collateral or which are rented, and the creditor from thereafter accelerating maturity of the obligation and enforcing the obligation and his security interest in the goods at any time after default. In any enforcement proceeding, however, the creditor shall affirmatively plead and prove either that the notice to cure is not required or that the creditor has given the required notice, but the failure to so plead does not invalidate any action taken by the creditor that is otherwise lawful and if the creditor has rightfully repossessed any collateral the repossession does not constitute conversion.\n\n(7) Any repossession of collateral or rented property in violation of this section is void and the creditor is liable for conversion.\n\nHISTORY: 1976 Act No. 686 Section 39; 1982 Act No. 385, Section 45; 1984 Act No. 355, Section 9; 1985 Act No. 121, Section 14.",

A refund may not be made by reducing the consumer's obligation by the amount of the excess charge, unless the creditor has notified the consumer that the consumer may request a refund and the consumer has not so requested within thirty days thereafter. If the consumer has paid an amount in excess of the lawful obligation under the agreement, the consumer may recover the excess amount from the person who made the excess charge or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments from or enforcement of rights against consumers arising from the debt.\n\n(3) If a creditor has contracted for or received a charge in excess of that allowed by this title, or if a consumer is entitled to a refund and a person liable to the consumer refuses to make a refund within a reasonable time after demand, the consumer may recover from the creditor or the person liable in an action other than a class action a penalty in an amount determined by the court not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars. With respect to excess charges arising from sales or loans made pursuant to a revolving charge or revolving loan account, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two years after the violation or passage of a reasonable time for refund occurs.

If the violation consists of a prohibited agreement, giving the consumer a corrected copy of the writing containing the violation is sufficient notification and correction. If the violation consists of of an excess charge, correction shall be made by an adjustment or refund.
