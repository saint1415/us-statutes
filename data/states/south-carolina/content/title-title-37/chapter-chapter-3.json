With respect to a consumer loan made pursuant to open-end credit, the finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed twelve percent per year if the finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a charge for each monthly billing cycle which is one percent of the average daily balance of the open-end account in the billing cycle for which the charge is made. The average daily balance of the open-end account is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during that cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle. The amount unpaid on a day is determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the beginning of that day all purchases, loans, and other debits and deducting all payments and other credits made or received as of that day. If the billing cycle is not monthly, the finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed twelve percent per year if the finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a percentage which bears the same relation to one percent as the number of days in the billing cycle bears to three hundred sixty-five divided by twelve. A billing cycle is monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the same date each month or does not vary by more than four days from the regular date.\n\n(2) With respect to a consumer loan, including a loan pursuant to open-end credit, a supervised lender may contract for and receive a loan finance charge as provided:\n\n(a) on loans with a cash advance not exceeding six hundred dollars, a maximum charge not exceeding the maximum charges imposed in Section 34-29-140 as disclosed as an annual percentage rate, provided that a supervised lender may impose a finance charge at a rate less than provided in Section 34-29-140, and provided further that the maximum charge shall not exceed the rate posted and filed pursuant to Section 37-3-305;\n\n(b) on loans with a cash advance exceeding six hundred dollars, and on all loans, regardless of the dollar amount, made by Supervised Financial Organizations, any rate filed and posted pursuant to Section 37-3-305; or\n\n(c) on loans of any amount, eighteen percent per year on the unpaid balances of principal.\n\n(3) This section does not limit or restrict the manner of calculating the finance charge, whether by way of add-on, discount, single annual percentage rate, or otherwise, so long as the rate of the finance charge does not exceed that permitted by this section.\n\nIf the loan is a precomputed consumer credit transaction:\n\n(a) the finance charge may be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due; and\n\n(b) the effect of prepayment is governed by the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (Section 37-3-210).\n\n(4) Except as provided in subsection (5), the term of a loan for purposes of this section commences on the day the loan is made. Any month may be counted as one-twelfth of a year but a day is counted as one-three hundred sixty-fifths of a year. Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, a part of a month in excess of fifteen days may be treated as a full month if periods of fifteen days or less are disregarded and that procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. The administrator may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Federal Truth in Lending Act with respect to treating as regular other minor irregularities in amount or time.\n\n(5) Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, he may make the same finance charge on all amounts financed within a specified range. A finance charge so made does not violate subsection (1) or (2) if:\n\n(a) when applied to the median amount within each range, it does not exceed the maximum permitted by the applicable subsection;\n\n(b) when applied to the lowest amount within each range, it does not produce a rate of finance charge exceeding the rate calculated according to item (a) by more than eight percent of the rate calculated according to item (a).\n\n(6) Notwithstanding subsection (2), if a lender can demonstrate with competent evidence that (a) any failure to post rates properly filed under Section 37-3-305 or failure to properly file these rates under Section 37-3-305 was a result of a bona fide error or excusable neglect, (b) the rates were properly posted or properly filed when the error or neglect was discovered or brought to the lender's attention, and (c) that no other failure to post or file rates has been brought to the lender's attention by the Department of Consumer Affairs or by consumers within the previous forty-eight month period, then the maximum rate of loan finance charges assessable by the lender is the rate previously properly filed with the Department of Consumer Affairs, provided, however, the lender that has failed or neglected to post rates or to file rates is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000.00 payable to the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\nHISTORY: 1976 Act No. 686 Section 1; 1980 Act No. 433, Section 2; 1982 Act No. 385, Section 30; 1984 Act No. 261, Section 5; 1985 Act No. 153, Section 2; 1989 Act No. 119, Section 2; 1995 Act No. 135, Sections 9, 10.",

The lender may contract for such a minimum charge even though the charge exceeds five percent of the unpaid amount of the installment.\n\n(3) A statement in the agreement between the lender and the debtor to the effect that the lender may charge the maximum delinquency charge (or late charge) authorized by law entitles the creditor to impose a delinquency charge in the dollar amount specified in subsections (1) and (2) as adjusted pursuant to Section 37-1-109 at the time the delinquency charge is imposed, subject to the five percent of the unpaid amount of the installment limitation, if applicable.\n\n(4) A delinquency charge under this section may be collected only once on an installment however long it remains in default. No delinquency charge may be collected with respect to a deferred installment unless the installment is not paid in full within ten days after its deferred due date.

It is the intent of the legislature that in construing this subsection, the courts be guided by interpretations to 16 C.F.R. 444.4 and 12 C.F.R. 227.15, as amended from time to time, relating to late charges, given by the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Courts.\n\n(6) If two installments or parts thereof of a precomputed consumer loan are in default for ten days or more, the lender may elect to convert the loan from a precomputed loan to one in which the loan finance charge is based on unpaid balances. In this event, he shall make a rebate pursuant to the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (Section 37-3-210) as if the date of prepayment were one day before the maturity date of a delinquent installment, and thereafter may make a loan finance charge as authorized by the provisions on loan finance charge for consumer loans by lenders not supervised lenders [Section 37-3-201(1)] or finance charge for consumer loans by supervised lenders [Section 37-3-201(2)], whichever is appropriate. The amount of the rebate must not be reduced by the amount of any permitted minimum charge (Section 37-3-210). If the creditor proceeds under this subsection, any delinquency or deferral charges made with respect to installments due on or after the maturity date of the first delinquent installment must be rebated, and no further delinquency or deferral charges may be made.\n\nHISTORY: 1976 Act No. 686 Section 1; 1982 Act No. 385, Section 32; 1991 Act No. 142, Section 11; 2004 Act No. 234, Section 3, eff May 11, 2004.",

      "text": "(1) In this section and in the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (Section 37-3-210) the following defined terms apply with respect to a precomputed consumer loan:\n\n(a) \"Computational period\" means (i) the interval between scheduled due dates of installments under the transaction if the intervals are substantially equal or, (ii) if the intervals are not substantially equal, one month if the smallest interval between the scheduled due dates of installments under the transaction is one month or more, and, otherwise, one week.\n\n(b) \"Deferral\" means a postponement of the scheduled due date of an installment as originally scheduled or as previously deferred.\n\n(c) \"Deferral period\" means a period in which no installment is scheduled to be paid by reason of a deferral.\n\n(d) The \"interval\" between specified dates means the interval between them including one or the other but not both of them; if the interval between the date of a transaction and the due date of the first scheduled installment does not exceed one month by more than 15 days when the computational period is one month, or does not exceed 11 days when the computational period is one week, the interval may be considered by the creditor as one computational period.\n\n(e) \"Periodic balance\" means the amount scheduled to be outstanding on the last day of a computational period before deducting the installment, if any, scheduled to be paid on that day.\n\n(f) \"Standard deferral\" means a deferral with respect to a transaction made as of the due date of an installment as scheduled before the deferral by which the due dates of that installment and all subsequent installments as scheduled before the deferral are deferred for a period equal to the deferral period. A standard deferral may be for one or more full computational periods or a portion of one computational period or a combination of any of these.\n\n(g) \"Sum of the balances method,\" also known as the \"Rule of 78,\" means a method employed with respect to a transaction to determine the portion of the loan finance charge attributable to a period of time before the scheduled due date of the final installment of the transaction. The amount so attributable is determined by multiplying the finance charge by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the periodic balances included within the period and the denominator of which is the sum of all periodic balances under the transaction. According to the sum of the balances method the portion of the finance charge attributable to a specified computational period is the difference between the portions of the finance charge attributable to the periods of time including and excluding, respectively, the computational period, both determined according to the sum of the balances method.\n\n(h) \"Transaction\" means a precomputed consumer loan unless the context otherwise requires.\n\n(2) Before or after default in payment of a scheduled installment of a transaction, the parties to the transaction may agree in writing to a deferral of all or part of one or more unpaid installments and the creditor may make at the time of deferral and receive at that time or at any time thereafter a deferral charge not exceeding that provided in this section.\n\n(3) A standard deferral may be made with respect to a transaction as of the due date, as originally scheduled or as deferred pursuant to a standard deferral, of an installment with respect to which no delinquency charge (Section 37-3-203) has been made or, if made, is deducted from the deferral charge computed according to this subsection. The deferral charge for a standard deferral may equal but not exceed the portion of the loan finance charge attributable to the computational period immediately preceding the due date of the earliest maturing installment deferred as determined according to the sum of the balances method multiplied by the whole or fractional number of computational periods in the deferral period, counting each day as 1/30 th of a month without regard to differences in lengths of months when the computational period is one month or as 1/7 th of a week when the computational period is one week. A deferral charge computed according to this subsection is earned pro rata during the deferral period and is fully earned on the last day of the deferral period.\n\n(4) With respect to a transaction as to which a creditor elects not to make and does not make a standard deferral or a deferral charge for a standard deferral, a deferral charge computed according to this subsection may be made as of the due date, as scheduled originally or as deferred pursuant to either subsection (3) or this subsection, of an installment with respect to which no delinquency charge (Section 37-3-203) has been made or, if made, is deducted from the deferral charge computed according to this subsection. A deferral charge pursuant to this subsection may equal but not exceed the rate of loan finance charge required to be disclosed to the debtor pursuant to law applied to each amount deferred for the period for which it is deferred computed without regard to differences in lengths of months, but proportionately for a part of a month, counting each day as 1/30 th of a month or as 1/7 th of a week. A deferral charge computed according to this subsection is earned pro rata with respect to each amount deferred during the period for which it is deferred.\n\n(5) In addition to the deferral charge permitted by this section, a creditor may make and receive appropriate additional charges (Section 37-3-202), and any amount of these charges which is not paid may be added to the deferral charge computed according to subsection (3) or to the amount deferred for the purpose of computing the deferral charge computed according to subsection (4).\n\n(6) The parties may agree in writing at the time of a transaction that, if an installment is not paid within ten days after its due date, the creditor may unilaterally grant a deferral and make charges as provided in this section. A deferral charge may not be made for a period after the date that the creditor elects to accelerate the maturity of the transaction.\n\nHISTORY: 1976 Act No. 686 Section 1.",

For these purposes \"city or town\" means an incorporated area and its contiguous unincorporated suburbs.\n\n(7)(a) A licensee may conduct the business of making supervised loans only at or from any place of business for which he holds a license and not under any other name than that in the license. Sales or leases made pursuant to a lender credit card do not violate this subsection.\n\n(b)(1) A person licensed to make supervised loans may not make or enter into a closed-end credit transaction, with an original repayment term of less than one hundred twenty days, unsecured by any interest in the consumer's personal property or secured by personal property, excluding motor vehicles that are free of any other liens or encumbrances, that does not have a market value that reasonably secures the amount of the loan, and the consumer:\n\n(i) receives funds from and incurs interest or a fee payable to a creditor, and contemporaneously with, or any time after, the receipt of funds, provides a check or other payment instrument to the creditor who agrees with the consumer not to deposit or present the check or payment instrument; or\n\n(ii) receives funds from and incurs interest or a fee payable to a creditor, and contemporaneously with, or any time after, the receipt of funds, authorizes the creditor to initiate a debit or debits to the consumer's deposit account by electronic fund transfer or a remotely created check or remotely created consumer item as defined in Section 36-3-103(16).\n\n(2) The board shall impose the following penalties for violation of this item:\n\n(a) a fine of five hundred dollars for the first violation;\n\n(b) a fine of one thousand dollars for the second violation;\n\n(c) permanent revocation of license for the third violation.\n\nThe board may not revoke a license issued pursuant to this chapter unless the licensee has been given notice and opportunity for hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\n(3) In addition to the penalties required in subsubitem (2), the board or the court may order and impose civil penalties upon a person subject to the provisions of this article for violations of this article or its regulations in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation. The board also may order repayment of unlawful or excessive fees charged to customers.\n\n(c) The provisions of item (b)(1) do not apply to credit unions, bank holding companies, banks, or financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n(d) A person licensed to make supervised loans that makes supervised loans secured by a motor vehicle that have an original repayment term of less than one hundred twenty days must comply with the provisions contained in Section 37-3-413.\n\n(8) The State Board of Financial Institutions, for the purposes of execution of its responsibilities under this Title, shall be entitled to collect from applicants and licensees the regulatory fees provided in Chapter 29, Title 34.
