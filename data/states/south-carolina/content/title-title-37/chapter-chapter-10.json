If a creditor uses a preference notice form substantially similar to a form distributed by the administrator, the form is in compliance with this section.\n\nThe creditor may require the attorney or agent to provide reasonable security to the creditor by way of mortgage title insurance in a company acceptable to the creditor and to comply with reasonable closing procedures. If title insurance is made a condition of the loan at any point during the negotiations, it must remain a condition all the time thereafter regardless of which attorney ultimately closes the transaction. Any legal fees other than for examination and certification of the title, the preparation of all required documents, and the closing of the transaction required or incurred by the creditor in connection with the transaction is the responsibility of the creditor regardless of which party pays for the title work, document preparation, and closing.\n\n(b) The creditor may contract and receive the following additional charges in a transaction in which the creditor authorizes a transferee of the real estate that serves as security for the transaction to assume the original debtor's obligation -\n\n(i) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (iii), the additional charges authorized by Section 37-3-202;\n\n(ii) the charge for any credit report on the debtor required by the creditor, if not paid to the creditor or a person related to the creditor; and\n\n(iii) a nonrefundable assumption fee in an amount not exceeding the lesser of four hundred dollars or one percent of the unpaid balance of the loan at the time the assumption transaction is consummated.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 385, Section 56; 1984 Act No. 355, Section 10; 1989 Act No. 164, Section 3; 1991 Act No. 142, Section 23; 1996 Act No. 355, Section 1.",

      "text": "(A) If a creditor violates a provision of this chapter, the debtor has a cause of action, other than in a class action, to recover actual damages and also a right in an action, other than in a class action, to recover from the person violating this chapter a penalty in an amount determined by the court of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars and not more than seven thousand five hundred dollars. No debtor may bring a class action for a violation of this chapter. No debtor may bring an action for a violation of this chapter more than three years after the violation occurred, except as set forth in subsection (C). The three-year statute of limitations applies to actions commenced after May 2, 1997. No inference should be drawn as to the applicable statute of limitations for any pending actions. This subsection does not bar a debtor from asserting a violation of this chapter in an action to collect a debt which was brought more than three years from the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off in such action.\n\n(B) No creditor may be held liable in an action brought under this section for a violation of this chapter if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.\n\n(C) If the court finds as a matter of law that the agreement or transaction is unconscionable pursuant to Section 37-5-108 at the time it was made, or was induced by unconscionable conduct, the court may, in an action other than a class action:\n\n(1) refuse to enforce the agreement, or a term, or part of the agreement or transaction that the court determines to have been unconscionable at the time it was made;\n\n(2) enforce the remainder of the agreement without the unconscionable term or part, or limit the application of the unconscionable term or part to avoid an unconscionable result;\n\n(3) rewrite or modify the agreement to eliminate an unconscionable term, part, or result and enforce the new agreement; or\n\n(a) not more than the total amount of the loan finance charge and allow repayment of the unpaid balance of the loan without any finance charge;\n\n(b) not more than double the amount of the excess loan finance charge or other charges or fees actually received by the creditor or paid by the debtor to a third party; and\n\n(c) attorney's fees and costs.\n\nAn action pursuant to this subsection may not be brought after the original scheduled maturity date of the debt.\n\n(D) In an action in which it is found that a creditor has violated this chapter, the court shall award to the debtor the costs of the action and to his attorneys their reasonable fees. In determining attorneys' fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the debtor is not controlling.\n\nHISTORY: 1982 Act No. 385, Section 56; 1997 Act No. 99, Section 1.",
