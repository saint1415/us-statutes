A respondent aggrieved by an order of the administrator may request a contested case before the Administrative Law Court in accordance with the Administrative Law Court's rules of procedure. The administrator may obtain an order from the Administrative Law Court for enforcement of his orders as provided in the Administrative Procedures Act and the Administrative Law Court's rules of procedure. The proceeding for enforcement must be initiated by filing a petition with the Administrative Law Court in accordance with the Administrative Law Court's rules of procedure, and copies of the request for a contested case hearing must be served upon all parties of record. (B) The jurisdiction of the Administrative Law Court is exclusive, and its final order may be appealed as provided in Sections 1-23-610 and 1-23-380. (C) A request for a contested case hearing pursuant to this section must be initiated within thirty days after a copy of the order of the administrator is received. If a request is not initiated, the administrator may move for an order from the Administrative Law Court for enforcement of his order upon a showing that the order was issued in compliance with this section, that a request for a contested case hearing was not initiated within thirty days after a copy of the order was received, and that the respondent is subject to the jurisdiction of the Administrative Law Court. (D) For purposes of this section and Sections 37-6-117 and 37-6-118, a violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act arising out of the production, promotion, or sale of consumer goods, services, or interests in land is considered a violation of this title subject to action by the administrator. (E) Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, the following administrative penalties may be levied against persons found to have engaged in violations of this title pursuant to subsection (A): (1) If the violator is found to have violated repeatedly and intentionally a provision of this title, the violator must be fined in an amount not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars and not to exceed ten thousand dollars for a transaction or occurrence or set of transactions or occurrences which violated multiple provisions of this title. (2) If the violator is shown to have violated a previous lawful order of the tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the violator may be fined in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars for each violation. (3) The penalties in items (1) and (2) are in addition to any other penalties provided by law or any other remedies provided by law. (F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a person who violates the provisions of Section 37-2-308 must be punished as follows: (1) for a first violation, the department shall send a written warning to the motor vehicle dealer; (2) for a second violation in a six-month period, the department may charge a five hundred dollar administrative penalty; (3) for a third violation in a six-month period, the department may charge not more than a one thousand dollar administrative penalty; and (4) for a fourth violation in a six-month period, the department may charge not more than a ten thousand dollar administrative penalty. Continued violations of the provisions of Section 37-2-308 may be considered grounds for revocation, suspension, and nonrenewal of a dealer license pursuant to Section 56-15-350. For the purposes of this subsection, a violation is defined as each notice received by the dealer for an offense. Each notice received by the dealer for a related offense serves as a subsequent violation. Additionally, the department must send notices of all offenses to motor vehicle dealers who have violated the provisions of Section 37-2-308 by mail. (G) The Administrative Law Judge may make findings and issue and enforce cease and desist orders regarding unconscionable conduct or unconscionable debt collection pursuant to this section, but the administrative law judge may not award damage, treble damage, or attorney's fee remedies to affected customers in these hearings.

Upon receiving written notice of an action brought by an individual or the Attorney General of South Carolina pursuant to Chapter 5, Title 39 or of an unfair trade practice action by the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the facts complained of or to seek sanctions against the person that is the subject of the complaint, the administrator shall automatically stay any pending investigation undertaken by him. Any action by the administrator shall be dismissed if the other action is dismissed with prejudice or results in a final judgment granting or denying the claim asserted. (2) The administrator shall notify the person whose conduct is investigated of his findings of fact and conclusions, separately stated. The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified or registered mail to the address of the principal office of the person investigated or to such other address as that person may designate in writing. (3) A person aggrieved by an order of the administrator may request a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court in accordance with the court's rules of procedure. If the person fails to request a contested case hearing within the time provided in the court's rules of procedure, the administrative order becomes final and the department may bring an action to enforce the order pursuant to Chapter 23, Title 1. (4) The findings and conclusions of the administrator, when and as they become final, either by failure to request a hearing as provided for in subsection (3) or by exhausting administrative and judicial remedies, shall be filed in the office of the administrator as a part of an education and information program provided for in item (e) of Section 37-6-117. (5) The provisions of this section shall not apply if consumer-industry appeals, arbitration or mediation panels or boards, whose decisions are binding on the participating business, are available in South Carolina for the product or service concerned, provided such business complies with the decision of the panel or board.
