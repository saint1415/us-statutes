In the case of an applicant that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, or trust, each natural person who has control of the applicant or who is the managing principal or a branch manager shall consent to a national fingerprint-based criminal history record check pursuant to Section 37-22-240 and submit a set of that natural person's fingerprints pursuant to this item. Refusal to consent to a criminal history record check constitutes grounds for the commissioner to deny licensure to the applicant as well as to any entity: (i) by whom or by which the applicant is employed; (ii) over which the applicant has control; or (iii) as to which the applicant is the current or proposed managing principal or a current or proposed branch manager. (B) In addition to the requirements imposed by the commissioner in subsection (A), each applicant for licensure as a loan originator shall: (1) have attained the age of at least eighteen years; (2) work for a licensed mortgage lender; (3) have satisfactorily completed prelicensing education of at least twenty hours, which shall include at least three hours on South Carolina laws and regulations, and the National Test Component with Uniform State Content approved pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5101, et seq.; (4) have never had a loan originator license revoked in any governmental jurisdiction; and (5) have not been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony in a domestic, foreign, or military court: (i) during the ten-year period preceding the date of the application for licensing, or (ii) at any time, if the felony involved an act of fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering.

(D) Each applicant shall identify one person meeting the requirements of subsections (B) and (C) to serve as the applicant's managing principal. (E) Every applicant for initial licensure shall pay a filing fee of one thousand dollars for licensure as a mortgage lender or fifty dollars for licensure as a loan originator, in addition to the actual cost of obtaining credit reports and national fingerprint-based criminal history record checks. If a licensed loan originator changes employment, a new license must be issued and a fee of twenty-five dollars must be paid. (F) A mortgage lender shall post and maintain a surety bond in an amount determined by the commissioner, based on the total dollar amount of mortgage loans subject to regulation by the commissioner pursuant to this act in a calendar year in this State pursuant to the following: (i) dollar volume of mortgage loans from $0 to $49,999,999, surety bond of $50,000, (ii) dollar volume of mortgage loans from $50,000,000 to $249,999,999, surety bond of $100,000, (iii) dollar volume of mortgage loans greater than $250,000,000 surety bond of $150,000. In no case is the surety bond less than fifty thousand dollars. The surety bond must be executed by a surety company authorized by the laws of this State to transact business within this State. The surety bond must be in a form satisfactory to the commissioner, must be executed to the commissioner, and must be for the use of the State for the recovery of expenses, fines, and fees, or any of them, levied pursuant to this chapter and for consumers who have losses or damages as a result of noncompliance with this chapter by the mortgage lender. The full amount of the surety bond must be in effect at all times. The license of a licensee expires upon the termination of the bond by the surety company, unless a new bond is filed with the commissioner before the termination of the previous bond. If the license expires based on bond termination, all licensed activity must cease and the person must apply for a license pursuant to subsection (A). (G) Any sole proprietor, general partner, member or manager of a limited liability company, or officer of a corporation who meets individually the requirements of subsection (B), upon payment of the applicable fee, meets the qualifications for licensure as a loan originator subject to the provisions of subsection (I). (H) Each principal office and each branch office of a licensed mortgage lender at which business is conducted must be licensed pursuant to this chapter and must be issued a separate license. A licensed mortgage lender shall file with the commissioner an application on a form prescribed by the commissioner which identifies the address of the principal office and each branch office and branch manager. The commissioner may license a personal residence of a loan originator as a branch office if it is located more than seventy-five miles from a commercial branch office location. A licensing fee of one hundred fifty dollars must be assessed by the commissioner for each branch office issued a license. (I) If the commissioner determines that an applicant meets the qualifications for licensure and finds that the financial responsibility, character, and general fitness of the applicant are such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant belief that the business is to be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently according to the purposes of this chapter and in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws, the commissioner shall issue a license to the applicant. If the commissioner does not make that determination, the commissioner shall refuse to license the applicant and shall notify him of the denial. (J) Issuance of a license does not indicate approval or acceptance of any contract, agreement, or other document submitted in support of the application. A licensee may not represent that its services or contracts are approved by the State or state agency. (K) A person who obtains a license as a mortgage lender, upon notice to the commissioner on a form prescribed by the commissioner, may act as a mortgage broker as defined in Section 37-22-110(1). The commissioner shall provide to the administrator notification of which mortgage lenders also are acting as brokers. A mortgage lender who also acts as a mortgage broker is not required to obtain a license as a mortgage broker pursuant to Chapter 58, Title 40, unless the person acts as a mortgage broker with regard to the majority of mortgage loans reported on the person's Mortgage Call Report filed during the last two quarters of the previous calendar year and the first two quarters of the current calendar year. A mortgage lender acting as a mortgage broker must comply with Sections 40-58-70, 40-58-75, and 40-58-78. (L) Transitional licenses will be granted as authorized by and pursuant to the SAFE Act.

      "text": "(A) All licenses issued by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter expire annually on the thirty-first day of December or on another date that the commissioner may determine. The license is invalid after that date unless renewed. The renewal period for all licensees is from November first through December thirty-first annually or on another date the commissioner may determine. A licensee desiring to renew its license must submit an application to the commissioner on forms and containing information the commissioner requires. Applications received after December thirty-first or another date the commissioner determines, are late and the late fees in subsection (B) apply. A license may be renewed by compliance with this section and by paying to the commissioner, in addition to the actual cost of obtaining credit reports and national fingerprint-based criminal history record checks as the commissioner may require, a renewal fee as prescribed by the board for each of the following: (1) for a licensed mortgage lender, an annual renewal fee of no more than eight hundred dollars and no more than one hundred fifty dollars for each branch office; and (2) for a licensed loan originator, an annual fee of no more than fifty dollars. (B) If a license of a licensed mortgage lender is not renewed during the renewal period, a late fee of not more than five hundred dollars as prescribed by the board, in addition to the renewal fee in subsection (A)(1), must be assessed. If a license of a licensed loan originator is not renewed during the renewal period, a late fee of not more than one hundred dollars as prescribed by the board, in addition to the renewal fee in subsection (A)(2), must be assessed as a late fee to a renewal. If a licensee fails to renew its license within thirty days after the date the license expires or otherwise fails to maintain a valid license, the commissioner shall require the licensee to comply with the requirements for the initial issuance of a license pursuant to this chapter, in addition to paying any fee that has accrued. (C) At any time required by the commissioner, each person described in Section 37-22-140 shall furnish to the commissioner consent to a national fingerprint-based criminal history record check and a set of fingerprints in a form acceptable to the commissioner. Refusal to consent to a criminal history record check may constitute grounds for the commissioner to deny renewal of the license of the person as well as the license of another person by which he is employed, over which he has control, or as to which he is the current or proposed managing principal or a current or proposed branch manager. (D) A license issued pursuant to this chapter is not assignable or transferable. Control of a licensee must not be acquired through a stock purchase or other device without the prior written consent of the commissioner. The commissioner may not give written consent if the commissioner finds that any of the grounds for denial, revocation, or suspension of a license pursuant to Section 37-22-200 are applicable to the acquiring person.

However, the commissioner may enter only a denial order pursuant to this subitem, and the commissioner shall vacate the order when the deficiency is corrected; or (j) has falsely certified attendance or completion of hours at an approved education course. (B) The commissioner, by order, summarily may postpone or suspend the license of a licensee pending final determination of a proceeding pursuant to this section. Upon entering the order, the commissioner shall notify promptly the applicant or licensee that the order has been entered, the reasons for the order, and the procedure for requesting a hearing before the Administrative Law Court. If a licensee does not request a hearing and the commissioner does not request a hearing, the order remains in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. (C) The commissioner, by order, may impose an administrative penalty upon a licensee or any member, partner, officer, director, or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions on behalf of a licensee for a violation of this chapter.

(D) In addition to other powers pursuant to this chapter, upon finding that an action of a person is in violation of this chapter, the commissioner may order the person to cease from the prohibited action. If the person subject to the order fails to request a contested case hearing in accordance with Section 37-22-130, or if the person requests the hearing and it is denied or dismissed, and the person continues to engage in the prohibited action in violation of the commissioner's order, the person is subject to an administrative penalty that may not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars for each violation of the commissioner's order. The penalty provision of this section is in addition to and not instead of another provision of law for failure to comply with an order of the commissioner.

(G) If the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a licensee or other person has violated this chapter or that facts exist that would be the basis for an order against a licensee or other person, the commissioner, either personally or by a person duly designated by the commissioner, at any time may investigate or examine the loans and business of the licensee and examine the books, accounts, records, and files of the licensee or other person relating to the complaint or matter under investigation. The reasonable cost of this investigation or examination must be charged against the licensee. The commissioner may require the licensee or other person to submit a consent to a national and state fingerprint-based criminal history record check and a set of that person's fingerprints in a form acceptable to the commissioner in connection with an examination or investigation. Refusal to submit the requested criminal history record check or a set of fingerprints is grounds for disciplinary action.

(I) The commissioner, at the licensee's expense, may conduct routine examinations of the books and records of a licensee to determine compliance with this chapter. (J) The commissioner shall cooperate and share information with an agency of this State, other states, or the federal government concerning activity regulated by this chapter. The commissioner shall accept or participate in examinations conducted by one of these agencies. (K) In addition to the authority described in this section, the commissioner may require a person to pay to a borrower or other natural person amounts received by the person or its employees in violation of this chapter. (L) If the commissioner finds that the managing principal, branch manager, or loan originator of a licensee had knowledge of, or reasonably should have had knowledge of, or participated in an activity that results in the entry of an order suspending or withdrawing the license of a licensee, the commissioner may prohibit the branch manager, managing principal, or loan originator from serving as a branch manager, managing principal, or loan originator for the period of time the commissioner considers necessary. (M) Orders issued by the commissioner or by the Administrative Law Court pursuant to this chapter must be reported by the commissioner to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
