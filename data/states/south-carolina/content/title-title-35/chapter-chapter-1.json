If a registration statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is issued under Section 35-1-306, the Securities Commissioner shall retain a fee set forth by the Securities Commissioner by rule or order.\n\n(c) A registration statement filed under Section 35-1-303 or 35-1-304 must specify:\n\n(1) the amount of securities to be offered in this State;\n\n(2) the States in which a registration statement or similar record in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed; and\n\n(3) any adverse order, judgment, or decree issued in connection with the offering by a State securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a court.\n\n(d) A record filed under this chapter or the predecessor chapter within five years preceding the filing of a registration statement or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available to the public without charge via the Internet may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the record is currently accurate.\n\n(e) In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record may not be required under subsection (i) or Section 35-1-304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable effort or expense.\n\n(f) A rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous five years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this State be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this State or elsewhere. The conditions of any escrow or impoundment required under this subsection may be established by rule adopted or order issued under this chapter, but the Securities Commissioner may not reject a depository institution solely because of its location in another State.\n\n(g) A rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may require as a condition of registration that a security registered under this chapter be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed under this chapter or preserved for a period specified by the rule or order, which may not be longer than five years.\n\n(h) Except while a stop order is in effect under Section 35-1-306, a registration statement is effective for one year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order under this chapter during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker-dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this chapter are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one year after its effective date. A registration statement may be withdrawn only with the approval of the Securities Commissioner.\n\n(i) While a registration statement is effective, a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may require the person that filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep the information or other record in the registration statement reasonably current, and to disclose the progress of the offering.\n\n(j) A registration statement may be amended after its effective date. The posteffective amendment becomes effective when the Securities Commissioner so orders. If a posteffective amendment is made to increase the number of securities specified to be offered or sold, the person filing the amendment shall pay a registration fee set forth by the Securities Commissioner by rule or order. A posteffective amendment relates back to the date of the offering of the additional securities being registered if, within one year after the date of the sale, the amendment is filed and the additional registration fee is paid.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 110, Section 1, eff January 1, 2006.",

An action under this subsection is governed by the following:\n\n(1) The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the security, and interest at the legal rate of interest from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (3).\n\n(2) The tender referred to in paragraph (1) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of ownership of the security and willingness to exchange the security for the amount specified. A purchaser that no longer owns the security may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (3).\n\n(3) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, and interest at the legal rate of interest from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.\n\n(c) A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security in violation of Section 35-1-501 or by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection is governed by the following:\n\n(1) The seller may maintain an action to recover the security, and any income received on the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the purchase price, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (3).\n\n(2) The tender referred to in paragraph (1) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness to take delivery of the security for the amount specified. If the purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (3).\n\n(3) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, and interest at the legal rate of interest from the date of the sale of the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.\n\n(d) A person acting as a broker-dealer or agent that sells or buys a security in violation of Section 35-1-401(a), 35-1-402(a), or 35-1-506 is liable to the customer. The customer, if a purchaser, may maintain an action for recovery of actual damages as specified in subsections (b)(1) through (3), or, if a seller, for a remedy as specified in subsections (c)(1) through (3).\n\n(e) A person acting as an investment adviser or investment adviser representative that provides investment advice regarding securities for compensation in violation of Section 35-1-403(a), 35-1-404(a), or 35-1-506 is liable to the client. The client may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice, interest at the legal rate of interest from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.\n\n(f) A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for providing investment advice regarding securities to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person, is liable to the other person. An action under this subsection is governed by the following:\n\n(1) The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages caused by the fraudulent conduct, interest at the legal rate of interest from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income received as a result of the fraudulent conduct.\n\n(2) This subsection does not apply to a broker-dealer or its agents if the investment advice regarding securities that is provided is solely incidental to transacting business as a broker-dealer and no special compensation is received for the investment advice regarding securities.\n\n(g) The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections (b) through (f):\n\n(1) a person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist;\n\n(2) an individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), including an individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist;\n\n(3) an individual who is an employee, or a person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; and\n\n(4) a person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f), unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.\n\n(5) a person who, with actual knowledge that a person is committing acts sufficient to violate Sections 35-1-501 and 35-1-502, nonetheless intentionally furthers the violation with actual awareness that the person is rendering substantial assistance to the person committing the violation of Sections 35-1-501 and 35-1-502, thereby becomes an aider and abettor of the violation, and is therefore jointly and severally liable with and to the same extent as the assisted person who engaged in the fraudulent activity, provided, however, this subsection (5) does not require any due diligence investigation nor impose liability for failure to perform any due diligence investigation otherwise required.\n\n(h) A person liable under this section has a right of contribution as in cases of contract against any other person liable under this section for the same conduct.\n\n(i) A cause of action under this section survives the death of an individual who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.\n\n(j) A person may not obtain relief:\n\n(1) under subsection (b) for violation of Section 35-1-301, or under subsection (d) or (e), unless the action is instituted within three years after the violation occurred; or\n\n(2) under subsection (b), other than for violation of Section 35-1-301, or under subsection (c) or (f), unless the action is instituted within the earlier of three years after discovery of the facts constituting the violation or five years after the violation.\n\n(k) A person that has made, or has engaged in the performance of, a contract in violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter, or that has acquired a purported right under the contract with knowledge of conduct by reason of which its making or performance was in violation of this chapter, may not base an action on the contract.\n\n(l) A condition, stipulation, or provision including, but not limited to, any choice of law provision directly or indirectly binding a person purchasing or selling a security or receiving investment advice regarding securities to waive compliance with this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter is void.\n\n(m) The rights and remedies provided by this chapter are in addition to any other rights or remedies that may exist, but this chapter does not create a cause of action not specified in this section or Section 35-1-411(e).\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 110, Section 1, eff January 1, 2006.",
