For the purposes of this article the districts may serve as agents and advisors to the department.\n\n(6) \"Danger to life or property\" means a situation exists where the hazard potential as determined by the department is such that dam failure or improper reservoir operation may cause injury to persons, loss of human life, or damage to property.\n\n(7) \"Detailed inspection\" means all studies, investigations, and analyses necessary to evaluate conclusively the structural safety and hydraulic capacity of a dam or reservoir and appurtenant works. This inspection includes, but is not limited to, soil analyses, concrete or earth stability analyses, materials testing, foundation explorations, and hydrologic analyses, including basin studies and flood potential. This inspection must be performed by a qualified registered professional engineer.\n\n(8) \"Enlargement\" means a change in or an addition to an existing dam or reservoir which raises or may raise the water storage elevation of the water impounded by the dam or reservoir.\n\n(9) \"Owner\" means those who own, control, operate, maintain, manage, or propose to construct a dam or reservoir.\n\n(10) \"Removal\" means destruction or breaching of an existing dam or drainage of water impoundment or reservoir.\n\n(11) \"Reservoir\" means a reservoir which contains the impoundment of water by a dam or reservoir.\n\n(12) \"Order\" means a written document prepared and issued by the department which mandates specific actions to be accomplished by a dam owner within a specified time frame.
