Adequate notice as to a regulation affecting only a particular location may be by a sign, uniform waterway marker, posted notice, or other effective method of communicating the essential provisions of the regulation in the immediate vicinity of the location in question. Where a regulation applies generally as to Lake Wylie or its shoreline area, or both, there must be a posting of notices, signs, or markers communicating the essential provisions in at least three different places throughout the area and it must be printed in a newspaper of general circulation in the three counties.\n\n(D) A copy of each regulation promulgated under this section must be filed by the commission with the following persons:\n\n(1) the Secretaries of State of North and South Carolina;\n\n(2) the clerk of superior court of Mecklenburg and Gaston Counties and the clerk of court of York County;\n\n(3) the Directors of the Wildlife Resources Commission of North Carolina and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.\n\n(E) Any official designated in subsection (D) above may issue certified copies of regulations filed with him under the seal of his office.

These duties include investigation of crimes an officer reasonably believes have been, or are about to be, committed within the area in question. This includes traversing by reasonable routes from one portion of this area to another although across territory not within the boundaries of Lake Wylie and its shoreline area; conducting prisoners in custody to a court or detention facilities as may be authorized by law, although this may involve going outside the area in question; execution of process connected with any criminal offense alleged to have been committed within the boundaries in question, except that this process may not be executed by virtue of this provision beyond the boundaries of the three counties. This also includes continuing pursuit of and arresting any violator or suspected violator as to which grounds for arrest arose within the area in question.\n\n(E) Where law enforcement officers are given additional territorial jurisdiction under the provisions of this section, this is considered an extension of the duties of the office held and no officer shall take any additional oath or title of office.\n\nHISTORY: 1987 Act No. 176, Section 9; 1988 Act No. 679, Section 1.",
