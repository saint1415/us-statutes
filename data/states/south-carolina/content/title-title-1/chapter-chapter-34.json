Accordingly, all agencies should enforce the same editions of nationally recognized codes and standards for the construction, manufacture, renovation, improvement, and maintenance of structures. To effect this policy, it is intended that all state regulatory agencies enforce the same editions of nationally recognized codes.\n\nHISTORY: 2003 Act No. 83, Section 3.",

An agency may propose the adoption of the latest edition of a nationally recognized code by publishing a notice in the State Register. The notice shall contain:\n\n(1) a reference to the agency's original adoption of the nationally recognized code;\n\n(2) the complete name of the nationally recognized code and the edition being adopted;\n\n(3) the name and address of the organization which issued the nationally recognized code; and\n\n(4) an invitation to comment to the agency concerning particular sections of the proposed edition.\n\n(B) If no comments are received within sixty days of publication provided pursuant to subsection (A), the agency may file a notice with the Legislative Council to be published in the State Register that the nationally recognized code is promulgated without amendment. Publication of the notice creates a rebuttable presumption that the edition to which it refers was promulgated under this section, is available for public inspection at the agency, and was promulgated without amendment.\n\n(C) If negative comments are received concerning sections of the latest edition or if the agency proposes amendments to the latest edition, the notice provided for in subsection (A) shall serve as the notice of drafting required pursuant to Section 1-23-110 and all affected sections must be proposed as regulations pursuant to Section 1-23-120 and are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act. All other sections of the latest edition may be promulgated by notice pursuant to subsection (B).\n\n(D) An agency that requires compliance with an earlier edition of a nationally recognized code shall accept full and complete compliance with the latest edition of that code unless it has promulgated amendments to the code pursuant to this section.\n\nHISTORY: 2003 Act No. 83, Section 3.",
