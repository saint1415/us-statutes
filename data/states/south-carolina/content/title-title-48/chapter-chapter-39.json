South Carolina can only regain control of the regulation of its critical areas by developing its own management program. The key to accomplishing this is to encourage the state and local governments to exercise their full authority over the lands and waters in the coastal zone.\n\n(D) The coastal zone and the fish, shellfish, other living marine resources and wildlife therein, may be ecologically fragile and consequently extremely vulnerable to destruction by man's alterations.\n\n(E) Important ecological, cultural, natural, geological and scenic characteristics, industrial, economic and historical values in the coastal zone are being irretrievably damaged or lost by ill-planned development that threatens to destroy these values.\n\n(F) In light of competing demands and the urgent need to protect and to give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone while balancing economic interests, present state and local institutional arrangements for planning and regulating land and water uses in such areas are inadequate.\n\nHISTORY: 1977 Act No. 123, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1235.",

If the proposed project is in one or more of the State's harbors or in a waterway used for commercial navigation and shipping or in an area set aside for port development in an approved management plan, then a certificate from the South Carolina State Ports Authority declaring the proposed project or activity would not unreasonably interfere with commercial navigation and shipping must be obtained by the department prior to issuing a permit.\n\n(3) The extent to which the applicant's completed project would affect the production of fish, shrimp, oysters, crabs or clams or any marine life or wildlife or other natural resources in a particular area including but not limited to water and oxygen supply.\n\n(4) The extent to which the activity could cause erosion, shoaling of channels or creation of stagnant water.\n\n(5) The extent to which the development could affect existing public access to tidal and submerged lands, navigable waters and beaches or other recreational coastal resources.\n\n(6) The extent to which the development could affect the habitats for rare and endangered species of wildlife or irreplaceable historic and archeological sites of South Carolina's coastal zone.\n\n(7) The extent of the economic benefits as compared with the benefits from preservation of an area in its unaltered state.\n\n(8) The extent of any adverse environmental impact which cannot be avoided by reasonable safeguards.\n\n(9) The extent to which all feasible safeguards are taken to avoid adverse environmental impact resulting from a project.\n\n(10) The extent to which the proposed use could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners.\n\n(B) After considering the views of interested agencies, local governments and persons, and after evaluation of biological and economic considerations, if the department finds that the application is not contrary to the policies specified in this chapter, it shall issue to the applicant a permit.

      "text": "The General Assembly finds that:\n\n(1) The beach/dune system along the coast of South Carolina is extremely important to the people of this State and serves the following functions:\n\n(a) protects life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economical and effective manner;\n\n(b) provides the basis for a tourism industry that generates approximately two-thirds of South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenue which constitutes a significant portion of the state's economy. The tourists who come to the South Carolina coast to enjoy the ocean and dry sand beach contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues;\n\n(c) provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered. Waters adjacent to the beach/dune system also provide habitat for many other marine species;\n\n(d) provides a natural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being.\n\n(2) Beach/dune system vegetation is unique and extremely important to the vitality and preservation of the system.\n\n(3) Many miles of South Carolina's beaches have been identified as critically eroding.\n\n(4) Chapter 39 of Title 48, Coastal Tidelands and Wetlands, prior to 1988, did not provide adequate jurisdiction to the South Carolina Coastal Council to enable it to effectively protect the integrity of the beach/dune system. Consequently, without adequate controls, development unwisely has been sited too close to the system. This type of development has jeopardized the stability of the beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacent property. It is in both the public and private interests to protect the system from this unwise development.\n\n(5) The use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices such as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatened structures adjacent to the beach has not proven effective. These armoring devices have given a false sense of security to beachfront property owners. In reality, these hard structures, in many instances, have increased the vulnerability of beachfront property to damage from wind and waves while contributing to the deterioration and loss of the dry sand beach which is so important to the tourism industry.\n\n(6) Erosion is a natural process which becomes a significant problem for man only when structures are erected in close proximity to the beach/dune system. It is in both the public and private interests to afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle. This space can be provided only by discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune system.\n\n(7) Inlet and harbor management practices, including the construction of jetties which have not been designed to accommodate the longshore transport of sand, may deprive downdrift beach/dune systems of their natural sand supply. Dredging practices which include disposal of beach quality sand at sea also may deprive the beach/dune system of much-needed sand.\n\n(8) It is in the state's best interest to protect and to promote increased public access to South Carolina's beaches for out-of-state tourists and South Carolina residents alike.\n\n(9) Present funding for the protection, management, and enhancement of the beach/dune system is inadequate.\n\n(10) There is no coordinated state policy for post-storm emergency management of the beach/dune system.\n\n(11) A long-range comprehensive beach management plan is needed for the entire coast of South Carolina to protect and manage effectively the beach/dune system, thus preventing unwise development and minimizing man's adverse impact on the system.\n\nHISTORY: 1990 Act No. 607, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1235; 2018 Act No. 173 (H.4683), Section 5, eff May 3, 2018.",

Each building of a condominium regime is considered a separate habitable structure but, if a building is divided into apartments, then the entire building, not the individual apartment, is considered a single habitable structure. Additionally, a habitable structure includes porches, gazebos, and other attached improvements.\n\n(3) Department means the Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\n(4) Beach nourishment means the artificial establishment and periodic renourishment of a beach with sand that is compatible with the existing beach in a way so as to create a dry sand beach at all stages of the tide.\n\n(5) The beach/dune system includes all land from the mean highwater mark of the Atlantic Ocean landward to the setback line described in Section 48-39-280.\n\n(6) A standard erosion zone is a segment of shoreline which is subject to essentially the same set of coastal processes, has a fairly constant range of profiles and sediment characteristics, and is not influenced directly by tidal inlets or associated inlet shoals.\n\n(7) An inlet erosion zone is a segment of shoreline along or adjacent to tidal inlets which is influenced directly by the inlet and its associated shoals.\n\n(8) Master plan means a document or a map prepared by a developer or a city as a policy guide to decisions about the physical development of the project or community.\n\n(9) Planned development means a development plan which has received local approval for a specified number of dwelling and other units. The siting and size of structures and amenities are specified or restricted within the approval.

If the owner disagrees with the appraisal of the department, he may obtain an appraisal to evaluate the damage to the building or pool. If the appraisals differ, then the two appraisers must select a third appraiser. If the two appraisers are unable to select a third appraiser, the clerk of court of the county where the structure lies must make the selection. Nothing in this section prevents a court of competent jurisdiction from reviewing, de novo, the appraisal upon the petition of the property owner.\n\n(12) Pool is a structure designed and used for swimming and wading.\n\n(13) Active beach is that area seaward of the escarpment or the first line of stable natural vegetation, whichever first occurs, measured from the ocean.\n\nHISTORY: 1988 Act No. 634, Section 3; 1990 Act No. 607, Section 3; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1235.",

      "text": "(A) A policy of beach preservation is established. The department must implement this policy and utilize the best available scientific and historical data in the implementation. The department must establish a baseline that parallels the shoreline for each standard erosion zone and each inlet erosion zone.\n\n(1) The baseline for each standard erosion zone is established at the location of the crest of the primary oceanfront sand dune in that zone.\n\n(a) If the primary ocean front sand dune is more than two hundred feet landward of the current line of stable vegetation, then the baseline must be established seaward of the primary oceanfront sand dune at a distance equal to thirty percent of the measured distance from the primary oceanfront sand dune to the current line of stable vegetation.\n\n(b) If there is no primary oceanfront sand dune, then the baseline must be established at whichever is further landward of the following:\n\n(i) the most seaward of the locations specified in item (4); or\n\n(ii) the landward edge of the active beach.\n\n(c) If the shoreline has been altered naturally or artificially by the construction of erosion control devices, then the baseline must be established by the department using the best scientific and historical data, as where the crest of the primary oceanfront sand dune for that zone would be located if the shoreline had not been altered.\n\n(2) The baseline for inlet erosion zones that are not stabilized by jetties, terminal groins, or other structures must be determined by the department as the most landward point of erosion at any time during the past forty years, unless the best available scientific and historical data of the inlet and adjacent beaches indicate that the shoreline is unlikely to return to its former position. In collecting and utilizing the best scientific and historical data available for the implementation of the beach preservation policy, the department, as part of the State Comprehensive Beach Management Plan provided for in this chapter, among other factors, must consider historical inlet migration, inlet stability, channel and ebb tidal delta changes, the effects of sediment bypassing on shorelines adjacent to the inlets, and the effects of nearby beach restoration projects on inlet sediment budgets.\n\n(3) The baseline within inlet erosion zones that are stabilized by jetties, terminal groins, or other structures must be determined in the same manner as provided for in item (1). However, the actual location of the crest of the primary oceanfront sand dune of that erosion zone is the baseline of that zone, not the location if the inlet had remained unstabilized.\n\n(4) A baseline established pursuant to this section must not move seaward from the most seaward location of the following:\n\n(a) the location of the baseline as established during the 2008 through 2012 establishment cycle;\n\n(b) the location of the baseline as proposed by the department on October 6, 2017; and\n\n(c) the location of the proposed October 6, 2017, baseline as revised by the department pursuant to a review or an appeal initiated before January 1, 2018.\n\n(B) To implement the beach preservation policy provided for in subsection (A), a setback line must be established landward of the baseline a distance which is forty times the average annual erosion rate or not less than twenty feet from the baseline for each erosion zone based upon the best historical and scientific data adopted by the department as a part of the State Comprehensive Beach Management Plan.\n\n(C) The department must establish baselines and setback lines for all geographic areas where baselines and setback lines were established on or before January 31, 2012. The baselines and setback lines must be established anew during establishment cycles that are not less than every seven years, but not more than every ten years following a previous establishment cycle and must be based upon the best available data. Until the department establishes new baselines and setback lines for a geographic area, the existing baselines and setback lines for the geographic area must be used.\n\n(D)(1) In each new establishment cycle of the baselines and setback lines, the department must:\n\n(a) stagger the establishment of the baselines and setback lines by geographic area and provide a tentative schedule of establishment for each geographic area on the department's website at least one hundred twenty days prior to beginning a new establishment cycle;\n\n(b) publish proposed locations of baselines and setback lines for a geographic area on the department's website for public input at least one hundred twenty days prior to establishing the baselines and setback lines for the geographic area;\n\n(c) on the date of the publication of the proposed locations of baselines and setback lines for a geographic area:\n\n(i) provide notice of the publication in a newspaper of general statewide circulation and a newspaper of local circulation in the geographic area; and\n\n(ii) make readily available to the public, including on the department's website, the information and raw data that the department used to determine the locations of the proposed baselines and setback lines and explanations for these determinations;\n\n(d) hold at least one public hearing in the county or municipality of a geographic area at least ninety days prior to establishing the baselines and setback lines for the geographic area; and\n\n(e) accept and review data up to thirty days prior to establishing baselines and setback lines for a geographic area to determine if a proposed baseline or setback line for the geographic area should be revised.\n\n(2) Baselines and setback lines for a geographic area are in effect upon the date of establishment and are subject to review pursuant to the provisions of subsection (F).\n\n(E)(1) In order to locate the baselines and the setback lines, the department must establish monumented and controlled survey points in each county fronting the Atlantic Ocean. The department must acquire sufficient surveyed topographical information on which to locate the baselines.\n\n(2) Surveyed topographical data typically must be gathered at two thousand foot intervals. However, in areas subject to significant near-term development and in areas currently developed, the interval, at the discretion of the department, may be more frequent. The resulting surveys must locate the crest of the primary oceanfront sand dune to be used as the baseline for computing the forty-year erosion rate.\n\n(3) The department, by regulation, may exempt specifically described portions of the coastline from the survey requirements of this section when, in its judgment, the portions of coastline are not subject to erosion or are not likely to be developed by virtue of local, state, or federal programs in effect on the coastline which would preclude significant development, or both.\n\n(4) If an erosion zone incurs extraordinary erosion due to the impact of a storm system or event named by the National Weather Service after June 1, 2018, then data collected from the erosion zone within eighteen months of the date of impact of the storm system or event must not be used to locate the crests of primary oceanfront sand dunes or to establish baselines pursuant to subsection (A)(1) and (A)(3).\n\n(F)(1) A landowner claiming ownership of property adversely affected by the establishment of a baseline or setback line, upon submittal of substantiating evidence, must be granted a review of the baseline or setback line. Alternatively, the municipality or county in which the property is situated, acting on behalf of the landowner with his written authorization, or an organization acting on behalf of the landowner with his written authorization, upon submittal of substantiating evidence, must be granted a review of the baseline and setback line. A review is initiated by filing a request for a review conference with the department board via certified mail within one year of the establishment of the baseline or setback line and must include a one hundred-dollar-review fee per property.\n\n(2) The initial decision to establish a baseline or setback line must be a department staff decision.\n\n(3) No later than sixty calendar days after the receipt of a request for review, the board must:\n\n(a) decline to schedule a review conference in writing; or\n\n(b) conduct a review conference in accordance with the provisions of item (4).\n\n(4) A review conference may be conducted by the board, its designee, or a committee of three members of the board appointed by the chair. The board shall set the place, date, and time for the conference; give twenty calendar days' written notice of the conference; and advise the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner that evidence may be presented at the conference. The review conference must be held as follows:\n\n(a) Review conferences are open to the public; however, the officers conducting the conference may meet in closed session to deliberate on the evidence presented at the conference. The burden of proof in a conference is upon the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner. During the course of the review conference, the staff must explain the staff decision and the materials relied upon to support its decision. The landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner shall state the reasons for contesting the staff decision and may provide evidence to support amending the staff decision. The staff may rebut information and arguments presented by the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner, and the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner may rebut information and arguments presented by the staff. Any review conference officer may request additional information and may question the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner and the staff.\n\n(b) After the review conference, the board, its designee, or a committee of three members of the board appointed by the chair shall issue, based upon the evidence presented, a written decision to the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner via certified mail no later than thirty calendar days after the date of the review conference. The written decision must explain the basis for the decision and inform the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner of the right to request a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court.\n\n(5) The landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner may file a request with the Administrative Law Court, in accordance with Chapter 23, Title 1, for a contested case hearing within thirty calendar days after:\n\n(a) written notice is received by the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner that the board declines to hold a review conference;\n\n(b) the sixty-calendar-day deadline to hold the review conference has lapsed and no conference has been held; or\n\n(c) the final agency decision resulting from the review conference is received by the landowner or the county, municipality, or organization acting on behalf of the landowner.\"\n\nHISTORY: 1988 Act No. 634, Section 3; 1990 Act No. 607, Section 3; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1235; 2006 Act No. 387, Sections 50, 51; 2016 Act No. 197 (S.139), Section 3, eff June 3, 2016; 2018 Act No. 173 (H.4683), Section 4, eff May 3, 2018; 2021 Act No. 41 (S.107), Sections 1, 2, eff May 17, 2021.",

New groins may be allowed only on beaches that have high erosion rates with erosion threatening existing development or public parks. In addition to these requirements, new groins may be constructed, and existing groins may be reconstructed, only in furtherance of an ongoing beach renourishment effort which meets the criteria set forth in regulations promulgated by the department and in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) The applicant shall institute a monitoring program for the life of the project to measure beach profiles along the groin area and adjacent and downdrift beach areas sufficient to determine erosion/accretion rates. For the first five years of the project, the monitoring program must include, but is not necessarily limited to:\n\n(i) establishment of new monuments;\n\n(ii) determination of the annual volume and transport of sand; and\n\n(iii) annual aerial photographs.\n\nSubsequent monitoring requirements must be based on results from the first five-year report.\n\n(b) Groins may be permitted only after thorough analysis demonstrates that the groin will not cause a detrimental effect on adjacent or downdrift areas. The applicant shall provide a financially binding commitment, such as a performance bond or letter of credit that is reasonably estimated to cover the cost of reconstructing or removing the groin and/or restoring the affected beach through renourishment pursuant to subitem (c).\n\n(c) If the monitoring program established pursuant to subitem (a) shows an increased erosion rate along adjacent or downdrift beaches that is attributable to a groin, the department shall require either that the groin be reconfigured so that the erosion rate on the affected beach does not exceed the preconstruction rate, that the groin be removed, and/or that the beach adversely affected by the groin be restored through renourishment.\n\n(d) Adjacent and downdrift communities and municipalities must be notified by the department of all applications for a groin project.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private cause of action, but nothing in this section shall be construed to limit a cause of action under recognized common law or other statutory theories. The sole remedies, pursuant to this section, are:\n\n(i) the reconstruction or removal of a groin; and/or\n\n(ii) restoration of the adversely affected beach and adjacent real estate through renourishment pursuant to subitem (c), or both.\n\nAn adjacent or downdrift property owner who claims a groin has caused or is causing an adverse impact shall notify the department of the impact. The department shall render an initial determination within sixty days of such notification. Final agency action must be rendered within twelve months of notification. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nA permit must be obtained from the department for items (2) through (8). However, no permit is required pursuant to this chapter for associated amenity structures constructed on fishing piers if local governmental bodies having responsibility for the planning and zoning authorize construction of those amenity structures. Associated amenity structures do not include those employed as overnight accommodations or those consisting of more than two stories above the pier decking. Associated amenity structures, excluding restrooms, handicapped access features, and observation decks, may occupy no more than thirty-five percent of the total surface area of the fishing pier or be constructed at a location further seaward than one-half of the length of the fishing pier as measured from the baseline. The department, in its discretion, may issue general permits for items (2) and (5) where issuance of the general permit would advance the implementation and accomplishment of the goals and purposes contained in Sections 48-39-250 through 48-39-360.\n\n(B) Construction, reconstruction, or alterations between the baseline and the setback line are governed as follows:\n\n(1) Habitable structures:\n\n(a) New habitable structures: If part of a new habitable structure is constructed seaward of the setback line, the owner must certify in writing to the department that the construction meets the following requirements:\n\n(i) The habitable structure is no larger than five thousand square feet of heated space. The structure must be located as far landward on the property as practicable. A drawing must be submitted to the department showing a footprint of the structure on the property, a cross section of the structure, and the structure's relation to property lines and setback lines which may be in effect. No erosion control structure or device may be incorporated as an integral part of a habitable structure constructed pursuant to this section.\n\n(ii) No part of the building is being constructed on the primary oceanfront sand dune or seaward of the baseline.\n\n(b) Habitable structures which existed on the effective date of Act 634 of 1988 or constructed pursuant to this section:\n\n(i) Normal maintenance and repair of habitable structures is allowed without notice to the department.\n\n(ii) Additions to habitable structures are allowed if the additions together with the existing structure do not exceed five thousand square feet of heated space. Additions to habitable structures must comply with the conditions of new habitable structures as set forth in subitem (a).\n\n(iii) Repair or renovation of habitable structures damaged, but not destroyed beyond repair, due to natural or manmade causes is allowed.\n\n(iv) Replacement of habitable structures destroyed beyond repair due to natural causes is allowed after notification is provided by the owner to the department that all of the following requirements are met:\n\na. The total square footage of the replaced structure seaward of the setback line does not exceed the total square footage of the original structure seaward of the setback line. The linear footage of the replaced structure parallel to the coast does not exceed the original linear footage parallel to the coast.\n\nb. The replaced structure is no farther seaward than the original structure.\n\nc. Where possible, the replaced structure is moved landward of the setback line or, if not possible, then as far landward as is practicable, considering local zoning and parking regulations.\n\nd. The reconstruction is not seaward of the baseline unless permitted elsewhere in Sections 48-39-250 through 48-39-360.\n\n(v) Replacement of habitable structures destroyed beyond repair due to manmade causes is allowed provided the rebuilt structure is no larger than the original structure it replaces and is constructed as far landward as possible, but the new structure must not be farther seaward than the original structure.\n\n(2) Erosion control devices:\n\n(a) No new erosion control structures or devices are allowed seaward of the setback line except:\n\n(i) structures or devices to protect a public highway that existed on June 25, 1990; and\n\n(ii) shoreline perpendicular wingwalls that extend landward at a ninety degree angle from the ends of existing erosion control structures or devices that are consistent in height and composition with the existing erosion control structures to which they are attached subject to any special conditions imposed by the department.\n\n(b) Erosion control structures or devices which existed on the effective date of this act must not be repaired or replaced if destroyed:\n\n(i) more than eighty percent above grade through June 30, 1995;\n\n(ii) more than sixty-six and two-thirds percent above grade from July 1, 1995, through June 30, 2005;\n\n(iii) more than fifty percent above grade after June 30, 2005.\n\n(iv) Damage to seawalls and bulkheads must be judged on the percent of the structure remaining intact at the time of damage assessment. The portion of the structure or device above grade parallel to the shoreline must be evaluated. The length of the structure or device parallel to the shoreline still intact must be compared to the length of the structure or device parallel to the shoreline which has been destroyed. The length of the structure or device parallel to the shoreline determined to be destroyed divided by the total length of the original structure or device parallel to the shoreline yields the percent destroyed. Those portions of the structure or device standing, cracked or broken piles, whalers, and panels must be assessed on an individual basis to ascertain if these components are repairable or if replacement is required. Revetments must be judged on the extent of displacement of stone, effort required to return these stones to the prestorm event configuration of the structure or device, and ability of the revetment to retain backfill material at the time of damage assessment. If the property owner disagrees with the assessment of a registered professional engineer acting on behalf of the department, he may obtain an assessment by a registered professional engineer to evaluate, as set forth in this item, the damage to the structure or device. If the two assessments differ, then the two engineers who performed the assessments must select a registered professional engineer to perform the third assessment. If the first two engineers are unable to select an engineer to perform the third assessment, the clerk of court of the county where the structure or device lies must make the selection of a registered professional engineer. The determination of percentage of damage by the third engineer is conclusive.\n\n(v) The determination of the degree of destruction must be made on a lot by lot basis by reference to county tax maps, unless the structure was constructed prior to Act 634 of 1988 as a single distinct seawall or bulkhead measuring a minimum of one thousand continuous linear feet parallel to the shoreline. The determination of the degree of destruction must be based on the single continuous seawall or bulkhead as a whole for these structures in accordance with Section 48-39-290(B)(2)(b)(iv).\n\n(vi) Erosion control structures or devices must not be enlarged, strengthened, or rebuilt but may be maintained in their present condition if not destroyed more than the percentage allowed in Section 48-39-290(B)(2)(b)(i), (ii), and (iii). Repairs must be made with materials similar to those of the structure or device being repaired.\n\n(c) Erosion control structures or devices determined to be destroyed more than the percentage allowed in Section 48-39-290(B)(2)(b)(i), (ii), and (iii) must be removed at the owner's expense. Nothing in this section requires the removal of an erosion control structure or a device protecting a public highway which existed on the effective date of Act 634 of 1988.\n\n(d) The provisions of this section do not affect or modify the provisions of Section 48-39-120(C).\n\n(e) Subitem (a) does not apply to a private island with an Atlantic Ocean shoreline of twenty thousand, two hundred ten feet which is entirely revetted with existing erosion control devices. Nothing contained in this subitem makes this island eligible for beach renourishment funds. For a private island with an Atlantic Ocean shoreline of twenty thousand, two hundred ten feet which is entirely revetted with existing erosion control devices, the baseline is established for this private island at the landward edge of the erosion control device and the setback line is established twenty feet landward of the baseline.\n\n(3) Pools, as defined in Section 48-39-270(12):\n\n(a) No new pools may be constructed seaward of the setback line unless the pool is built landward of an erosion control structure or device which was in existence or permitted on the effective date of this act and is built as far landward as practical.\n\n(b) Normal maintenance and repair is allowed without notice to the department.\n\n(c) If a pool, existing on July 1, 1988, is destroyed beyond repair, as determined by the department pursuant to Section 48-39-270(11), it may be replaced if the owner certifies in writing to the department that:\n\n(i) It is moved as far landward as practical. This determination of practicality must include the consideration of local zoning requirements.\n\n(ii) It is rebuilt no larger than the destroyed pool.\n\n(iii) It is constructed according to acceptable standards of pool construction and cannot be reinforced in a manner so as to act as an erosion control structure or device.\n\n(d) If a pool is not destroyed beyond repair as determined by the department pursuant to Section 48-39-270(11) but the owner wishes to replace it, the owner may do so if:\n\n(i) The dimensions of the pool are not enlarged.\n\n(ii) The construction conforms to sub-subitem (iii) of subitem (c).\n\n(4) All other construction or alteration between the baseline and the setback line requires a department permit. However, the department, in its discretion, may issue general permits for construction or alterations where issuance of the general permits would advance the implementation and accomplishment of the goals and purposes of Sections 48-39-250 through 48-39-360.\n\n(C)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions relating to new construction, a person, partnership, or corporation owning real property that is affected by the setback line as established in Section 48-39-280 may proceed with construction pursuant to a valid building permit issued as of the effective date of this section. The person, partnership, or corporation may proceed with the construction of buildings and other elements of a master plan, planned development, or planned unit development notwithstanding the setback line established in this chapter if the person, partnership, or corporation legally has begun a use as evidenced by at least one of the following:\n\n(a) All building permits have been applied for or issued by a local government before July 1, 1988.\n\n(b) There is a master plan, planned development, or planned unit development:\n\n(i) that has been approved in writing by a local government before July 1, 1988; or\n\n(ii) where work has begun pursuant to approval as evidenced by the completion of the utility and infrastructure installation designed to service the real property that is subject to the setback line and included in the approved master plan, planned development, or planned unit development.\n\n(2) However, repairs performed on a habitable structure built pursuant to this section are subject to the guidelines for repairs as set forth in this section.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section prohibits the construction of fishing piers or structures which enhance beach access seaward of the baseline, if permitted by the department.\n\n(D) Special permits:\n\n(1) If an applicant requests a permit to build or rebuild a structure other than an erosion control structure or device seaward of the baseline that is not allowed otherwise pursuant to Sections 48-39-250 through 48-39-360, the department may issue a special permit to the applicant authorizing the construction or reconstruction if the structure is not constructed or reconstructed on a primary oceanfront sand dune or on the active beach and, if the beach erodes to the extent the permitted structure becomes situated on the active beach, the permittee agrees to remove the structure from the active beach if the department orders the removal. However, the use of the property authorized under this provision, in the determination of the department, must not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.\n\n(2) The department's Permitting Committee Coastal Division shall consider applications for special permits.\n\n(3) In granting a special permit, the committee may impose reasonable additional conditions and safeguards as, in its judgment, will fulfill the purposes of Sections 48-39-250 through 48-39-360.\n\n(4) A party aggrieved by the decision to grant or deny a special permit application may appeal pursuant to Section 48-39-150(D).\n\n(E) The provisions of this section and Section 48-39-280 do not apply to an area in which the erosion of the beaches located in its jurisdiction is attributed to a federally authorized navigation project as documented by the findings of a Section 111 Study conducted under the authority of the federal Rivers and Harbors Act of 1968, as amended by the federal Water Resources Development Act of 1986, and approved by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Nothing contained in this subsection makes this area ineligible for beach renourishment funds. The baseline determined by the local governing body and the department is the line of erosion control devices and structures and the department retains its jurisdiction seaward of the baseline. In addition, upon completion of a department approved beach renourishment project, including the completion of a sand transfer system if necessary for long-term stabilization, an area under a Section 111 Study becomes subject to all the provisions of this chapter. For the purposes of this section, a beach nourishment project stabilizing the beach exists if a successful restoration project is completed consisting of at least one hundred fifty cubic yards a foot over a length of five and one-half miles, with a project design capable of withstanding a one-in-ten-year storm, as determined by department, and renourishment is conducted annually at a rate, agreed upon by the department and local governing body, equivalent to that which would occur naturally if the navigation project causing the erosion did not exist. If the two parties cannot agree, then the department must obtain the opinion of an independent third party. Any habitable structure located in an area in which the erosion of the beaches located in its jurisdiction is attributed to a federally authorized navigation project as documented by the findings of a Section 111 Study, which was in existence on September 21, 1989, and was over forty years old on that date and is designated by the local governing body as an historical landmark may be rebuilt seaward of the baseline if it is rebuilt to the exact specifications, dimensions, and exterior appearance of the structure as it existed on that date.\n\nHISTORY: 1988 Act No. 634, Section 3; 1990 Act No. 607, Section 3; 1993 Act No. 29, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1235; 2002 Act No. 198, Section 1; 2006 Act No. 387, Section 52; 2010 Act No. 285, Section 1, eff upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on June 28, 2010); 2011 Act No. 25, Sections 1, 2, eff May 9, 2011; 2016 Act No. 197 (S.139), Sections 2, 4, eff June 3, 2016; 2020 Act No. 129 (H.4811), Section 1, eff March 24, 2020; 2020 Act No. 178 (H.4945), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",
