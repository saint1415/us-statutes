The official number of qualified electors residing in a watershed conservation district is the number of registered electors residing in the district and registered one hundred twenty days before the date by which nominating petitions must be submitted. The board of commissioners and the county governing body shall give due notice that they will receive petitions to nominate candidates to be appointed as watershed conservation district directors.
