(B) As directed by this section, the department may promulgate regulations to implement WET tests that calibrate EPA's standard toxicity testing species and methods to the natural water chemistry representative of the lakes, streams, groundwater, and stormwater runoff of this State. In developing these regulations the department may use the findings of any scientifically defensible study it may conduct and may use other pertinent peer reviewed studies or conclusions. In the interim, this section shall not be construed to limit the department's authority to impose WET limits. (C) For purposes of performing WET reasonable potential determinations for a specific discharge and, where justified, setting WET permit limitations for that discharge, the department, notwithstanding any other provision of law shall: (1) develop procedures to allow up to one hundred percent dilution in waterbodies, based on the 7Q10 flow as defined by Regulation 61-68, where justified by the permittee or permit applicant and approved by the department; (2) use stream flow conditions other than those described in item (1) where justified by hydrological controls that are capable of ensuring critical flow conditions higher than the respective ten-year flows identified in item (1), to evaluate acute and chronic exposure; (3) use, for stormwater discharges, a representative flow greater than 7Q10 flow, as demonstrated on a site-specific basis, with any resulting WET permit limitations comprising only those expressed in terms of acute survival endpoints; (4) consider such mixing calculations as described in items (1), (2), and (3) to be consistent with its policy set forth in Regulation 61-68 for minimizing mixing zones; (5) give consideration to compliance with numeric criteria and actual instream biological conditions, in the absence of a valid scientific correlation between sublethal WET test results and the biological integrity of representative lakes, streams, and estuaries in this State, wherein biological integrity includes the richness, abundance, and balanced community structure of indigenous aquatic organisms; (6) allow, at the request of the permittee, the use of ambient receiving waters as control and dilution waters in WET tests; (7) exempt once-through, noncontact cooling water, which contains no additives, from toxicity requirements; and (8) allow dischargers to use WET testing protocols that utilize alternative species in accordance with applicable EPA regulations and guidance. (D) No part of this section shall be construed to limit the department's authority to adopt water quality criteria, to impose permit limits for specific chemical pollutants, to obligate the department to revalidate existing water quality criteria, or to establish additional water quality criteria for specific chemical pollutants. The department, whenever appropriate, shall utilize the flexibility of interpretation concerning WET testing and the use of WET test results provided by EPA. (E) For the purpose of implementing Section 48-1-20 and Regulation 61-68: (1) \"propagation\" is defined in Regulation 61-68; (2) \"biological integrity\" means a measure of the health of an aquatic or marine ecosystem using the richness and abundance of species as the primary indicator, and \"biological integrity\" is a key component of an \"instream bioassessment\"; (3) \"sublethal toxicity tests\" means laboratory experiments that measure the nonlethal biological effects, including, but not limited to, growth or reproduction, of effluents or receiving waters on aquatic organisms; (4) \"calibrate\" means a process to establish the baseline control condition based on the normal range of biological responses likely to occur when standard test organisms are exposed to various nontoxic waters sampled from streams and lakes throughout the State. (F) For any NPDES permit that was taken over by EPA due to provisions of Act 258 of 2004 from July 1, 2004, through the effective date of this subsection as revised by the provisions of this 2005 act, the department shall convey to EPA, through the certification process (40 C.F.R. Part 124.53), any additional requirements mandated under state law. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, the requirement for a counterpart state permit for any such discharge is waived. Alternatively, at the request of the permittee, the department may waive the certification process and issue a state permit. However, affected permittees shall submit applications for reissuance to the department in accordance with Regulation 61-9, at least one hundred eighty days in advance of the expiration of the federal permits. At the discretion of the department, the annual fees for NPDES permits in Regulation 61-30 may continue to be charged, when certifying a federal permit, if the department waives the certification fee. (G) The department shall reduce or eliminate WET monitoring requirements, as appropriate, in accordance with permit modification processes contained in Regulation 61-9, where dischargers demonstrate that their effluents do not demonstrate reasonable potential.

(2) The permit requirements of subsection (A)(1), Section 48-1-100, and Section 48-1-110 do not apply to: (a) discharges in a quantity below applicable threshold permitting requirements established by the department; (b) discharges for which the department has no regulatory permitting program; (c) discharges exempted by the department from permitting requirements; or (d) normal farming, silviculture, aquaculture, ranching, and wildlife habitat management activities that are not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation. (3) Subsection (A)(2) must not be construed to: (a) impair or affect common law rights; (b) repeal prohibitions or requirements of other statutory law or common law; or (c) diminish the department's authority to abate public nuisances or hazards to public health or the environment, to abate pollution as defined in Section 48-1-10(7), or to respond to accidental discharges or spills. (4) A person must first petition the department in writing for a declaratory ruling as to the applicability of a specific, existing regulatory program to a proposed or existing discharge into the environment, provided that the proposed or existing discharge is not exempt or excluded from permitting as is set forth in subsection (A)(2). The person proposing to emit or emitting such discharge must be named on and served with the petition. The department must, within sixty days after receipt of such petition, issue a declaratory ruling as to the applicability of such program to such discharge. If the department determines a permit is required under such program and that no exception or exclusion exists, including, but not limited to, the exceptions set forth in subsection (A)(2), the department must issue a declaration requiring the submission of an application to permit such discharge pursuant to the applicable permitting program. If the department further determines that immediate action is necessary to protect the public health or property due to such unpermitted discharge, the department may further declare the existence of an emergency and order such action as the department deems necessary to address the emergency. Any person to whom such emergency order is directed may apply directly to the Administrative Law Court for relief and must be afforded a hearing within forty-eight hours. Regardless of whether a hearing is held, the department must revoke all emergency orders as soon as conditions or operations change to the extent that an emergency no longer exists. A party contesting any department decision on a petition may request a contested case hearing in the Administrative Law Court. Notwithstanding the administrative remedy provided for in this section, no private cause of action is created by or exists under this chapter. (B)(1) A person who discharges organic or inorganic matter into the waters of this State as described in subsection (A) to the extent that the fish, shellfish, aquatic animals, wildlife, or plant life indigenous to or dependent upon the receiving waters or property is damaged or destroyed is liable to the State for the damages. The action must be brought by the State in its own name or in the name of the department. (2) The amount of a judgment for damages recovered by the State, less costs, must be remitted to the agency, commission, department, or political subdivision of the State that has jurisdiction over the fish, shellfish, aquatic animals, wildlife, or plant life or property damaged or destroyed. (3) The civil remedy provided in subsection (B)(2) is not exclusive, and an agency, commission, department, or political subdivision of the State with appropriate authority may undertake in its own name an action to recover damages independent of this subsection.

(2) \"Capacity, Management, Operation, and Maintenance or 'CMOM' plan\" means a comprehensive, dynamic framework for wastewater utilities to identify and incorporate widely accepted wastewater industry practices to: (a) better manage, operate, and maintain collection systems; (b) investigate capacity constrained areas of the collection system; and (c) respond to sanitary sewer overflow events. (3) \"Comprehensive review\" or \"review\" means a complete technical assessment of the components and operation of a sewage system or its treatment works that are contributing to, or may be contributing to, repetitive significant spills of untreated or partially treated domestic sewage. (4) \"Department\" means the Department of Health and Environmental Control. (5) \"Significant spill\" means a net discharge from a wastewater utility of at least five thousand gallons of untreated or partially treated domestic sewage that could cause a serious adverse impact on the environment or public health. \"Significant spill\" does not include spills caused by a natural disaster, direct act of a third party, or other act of God. (6) \"Wastewater utility\" or \"utility\" means the operator or owner of a sewage collection system or its treatment works providing sewer service to the public. \"Wastewater utility\" does not include manufacturers, electric utilities, agricultural operations, and wastewater treatment systems located on property owned by the federal government. (B) Utilities must verbally notify the department of any significant spill within twenty-four hours and by written submission within five days. (C) Upon receiving notice of a significant spill from a wastewater utility, the department must determine whether the responsible wastewater utility has had more than two significant spills per one hundred miles of its sewage collection system, in the aggregate and excluding private service laterals, during the twelve-month period up to and including the date of the significant spill. (D)(1) If the wastewater utility has had more than two significant spills per one hundred miles of its aggregate collection system miles during a twelve-month period, the department shall issue an order directing the utility to complete a comprehensive review of the sewage system and treatment works facility identified pursuant to subsection (C), or if the wastewater utility has a Capacity, Management, Operations, and Maintenance plan in place directing the utility to update this plan, the order must include, but is not limited to: (a) the submission of the findings of the comprehensive review or CMOM update; and (b) the required implementation of any plans to minimize the recurrence of such significant spills. (2) The comprehensive review, pursuant to item (1), must be performed by a licensed South Carolina professional engineer. (3) Unless the department's order is being appealed, the comprehensive review or CMOM update must be initiated by the wastewater utility's owner within two months of receiving an order from the department or, in the case of an appeal, within two months from the date the order becomes final and nonappealable. (E) The department shall require that all wastewater utilities provide public notice of any significant spill of five thousand gallons or more within twenty-four hours of the discovery. Where the responsible wastewater utility does not provide this notice, in addition to any enforcement response, the department shall provide public notice of the significant spill. (F) Nothing in this section contravenes the department's ability to undertake enforcement action under the Pollution Control Act, Chapter 1, Title 48, or any other state or federal law.
