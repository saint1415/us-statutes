And it is further declared to be the policy of the General Assembly to provide for the conservation of the soil and water resources of this State and for the control and prevention of soil erosion, and for the prevention of floodwater and sediment damages, and for furthering the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of water, and thereby to preserve natural resources, control floods, prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, assist in maintaining the navigability of rivers and harbors, preserve wildlife, promote recreational development, provide water storage for beneficial purposes, protect the tax base, protect public lands and protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the people of this State.
