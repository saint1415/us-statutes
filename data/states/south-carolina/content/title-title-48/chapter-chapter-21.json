The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public.3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.4. Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated.5. The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.(b) The purposes of this compact are to:1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining.2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining.3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.4. Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources.5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.ARTICLE II. Definitions(a) \"Mining\" means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter; any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location; and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on site farming or construction.(b) \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States.ARTICLE III. State Programs1. The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations.2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water.3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs for adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.4. The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past and future.ARTICLE IV. Powers1. Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change.2. Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining.3. Make recommendations concerning any aspect of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact.4. Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact.5. Cooperate with the Federal Government and any public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the purview of this compact.6. Consult, upon the request of a party state and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact.7. Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations.8. Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.ARTICLE V. The Commission(b) The commissioners shall be entitled to one vote on the commission. No action of the commission making a recommendation pursuant to Article IV -3, IV -7, and IV -8 or requesting, accepting or disposing of funds, services, or other property pursuant to this paragraph, Articles V (g), V (h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission is cast in favor thereof.

Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission.

The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: One-half in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the commission shall employ such available public sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.(c) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article V (h) of this compact; provided, that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under Article V (h) hereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the obligation.(d) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.
