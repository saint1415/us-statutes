Recoverers must provide visible tracking, such as hazardous waste manifests or bills of lading, of hazardous components and materials from the facility to the destination facilities and documentation, such as contracts, stating how the destination facility processes the materials received. No recoverer may send, either directly or through intermediaries, hazardous wastes to solid nonhazardous waste landfills or to nonhazardous waste incinerators for disposal or energy recovery. For the purpose of these guidelines, smelting of hazardous wastes to recover metals for reuse in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations is not considered disposal or energy recovery.\n\n(11) Recoverers must use a regularly implemented and documented monitoring and record-keeping program that tracks total inbound covered devices material weights and total subsequent outbound weights to each destination, injury and illness rates, and compliance with applicable permit parameters including monitoring of effluents and emissions. Recoverers must maintain contracts or other documents, such as sales receipts, suitable to demonstrate: (i) the reasonable expectation that there is a downstream market or uses for designated electronics, which may include recycling or reclamation processes such as smelting to recover metals for reuse; and (ii) that any residuals from recycling or reclamation processes, or both, are properly handled and managed to maximize reuse and recycling of materials to the extent practical.\n\n(12) Recoverers must employ industry-accepted procedures for the destruction or sanitization of data on hard drives and other data storage devices. Acceptable guidelines for the destruction or sanitization of data are contained in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Guidelines for Media Sanitation or those guidelines certified by the National Association for Information Destruction.\n\n(F) Each recoverer shall, during each calendar year, transport from each site that the recoverer uses to manage consumer covered devices not less than 75% of the total weight of consumer covered devices present at the site during the preceding calendar year. Each recoverer shall maintain on-site records that demonstrate compliance with this requirement and shall make those records available to the department for inspection and copying.\n\n(G) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a person from acting as a recoverer independently of a manufacturer electronic waste program.\n\n(H) Whenever the department determines that a person is in violation of a regulation promulgated pursuant to this section, the department may:\n\n(1) issue an order requiring the person to comply with the regulation;\n\n(2) bring a civil action for injunctive relief in the appropriate court; or\n\n(3) request the Attorney General bring civil or criminal enforcement action pursuant to this section.\n\nThe department also may impose reasonable civil penalties not to exceed ten thousand dollars, for each day of violation. After exhaustion of administrative remedies, a person against whom a civil penalty is invoked by the department may appeal the decision of the department or board to the court of common pleas, pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\n(I) A person who wilfully violates a regulation promulgated pursuant to this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than ten thousand dollars for each day of violation or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. If the conviction is for a second or subsequent offense, the punishment must be a fine not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars for each day of violation or imprisonment not to exceed two years, or both. The provisions of the subsection do not apply to officials and employees of a local government owning or operating, or both, a municipal solid waste management facility or to officials and employees of a region, comprised of local governments, owning or operating, or both, a regional municipal solid waste management facility.\n\n(J) Each day of noncompliance with an order issued pursuant to this section or noncompliance with a permit, regulation, standard, order, or requirement established pursuant to this section constitutes a separate offense.\n\nHISTORY: 2022 Act No. 234 (H.4775), Section 1.A, eff June 17, 2022.",
