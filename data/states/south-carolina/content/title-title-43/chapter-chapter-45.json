      "text": "The General Assembly finds that:\n\nA. Poverty continues to be the lot of a substantial number of South Carolinians.\n\nB. Rising energy costs, coupled with high unemployment, inflation, and high interest rates, have reduced significantly the real purchasing power of low-income and nearly poor individuals and families, particularly elderly handicapped individuals, to such levels that they are unable to acquire necessities of life.\n\nC. The real income of households receiving public assistance payments as a primary source of income has diminished in proportion to the real incomes of other households in South Carolina.\n\nD. Low-income households need a variety of forms of assistance to break the poverty cycle including financial support, equal access to health, education, housing, job training, and energy conservation services.\n\nE. South Carolina can achieve full economic and social potential only if all individuals have the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of their capabilities and to participate in the workings of our society.\n\nTherefore, it is the policy of South Carolina to provide an organizational framework through which a wide range of opportunities can be made available to assist low-income individuals in becoming self-sufficient so that they will be able to live in decency and dignity. It is the purpose of this chapter to insure that effective mechanisms are established at the local level to efficiently administer such federal funds as may be allocated to South Carolina for the purposes of carrying out Title VI of U.S. Public Law 97-35.\n\nHISTORY: 1983 Act No. 143 Section 2.",
