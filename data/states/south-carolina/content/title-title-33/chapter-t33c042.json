(b) A limited partnership that conducts or intends to conduct business in this State under a name other than the name shown in its certificate of limited partnership (or in the case of a foreign limited partnership that has registered in this State, the name shown in its certificate of registration to transact business in this State) shall file with the Secretary of State an assumed name certificate which shall state the name shown on its certificate of limited partnership (or certificate of registration in the case of a foreign limited partnership), the name under which the limited partnership's business is to be conducted, which assumed name shall not be deceptively similar to the name of any domestic or foreign limited partnership authorized to transact business in this State, or to any reserved name pursuant to Section 33-42-40 and the address of the partnership's registered office required to be maintained in this State. (c) Such filing shall be effective, unless sooner terminated by the filing of a certificate of termination or by the cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership (or in the case of foreign limited partnership by cancellation of the certificate of registration to transact business in this State), for a period expiring on December thirty-first of the fifth full calendar year following the year in which it is filed. It may be extended for additional consecutive periods of five full calendar years each by the filing of a new assumed name certificate not earlier than ninety days preceding the expiration of any such period. The Secretary of State shall notify a limited partnership of the impending expiration of its assumed name, by first-class mail addressed to the partnership's registered office as shown on the partnership's certificate of limited partnership (or certificate of registration in the case of a foreign limited partnership that has registered in this State), no later than three calendar months before the initial or subsequent five-year period will expire. (d) The Secretary of State shall maintain current lists, alphabetically arranged, of the partnership registrants and assumed names permitted hereunder. (e) The failure of any limited partnership to file the assumed name certificate required by subsection (b) does not: (i) impair the validity of any contract or act of the limited partnership; (ii) prevent the limited partnership from maintaining or defending any action, suit, or proceeding in any court of this State; or (iii) result in any limited partner becoming liable as a general partner solely by reason of the failure of the limited partnership to file the required assumed name certificate.

However, in no event may the limited partner, directly or indirectly, have any managerial control or decision-making authority including personnel decisions, with respect to the day-to-day operations of the limited partnership, and upon a default by the general partner wholesaler, the limited partner is not entitled, directly or indirectly, to any additional control, ownership, or financial interest in the general partner wholesaler, nor may the limited partner become the general partner in the limited partnership. No manufacturer, brewer, or importer of beer or its affiliate licensed in this State, directly or indirectly, may have any financial or ownership interest in the general partner wholesaler. It is further declared an unfair trade practice for any manufacturer, brewer, or importer of beer or its affiliate holding an interest in a limited partnership providing financial assistance to a general partner wholesaler pursuant to this section to have directly or indirectly any managerial control or decision-making authority, including personnel decisions, with respect to the day-to-day operations of the limited partnership. The only financial assistance that may be provided under the provisions of this section is the initial financial assistance to the limited partnership to acquire a licensed beer wholesaler. In this arrangement for financial assistance, the federal basic permit and the wholesaler's license issued by the department must be issued in the name of the general partner wholesaler on behalf of the limited partnership, and not in the name of the limited partnership nor in the name of the manufacturer, brewer, or importer or its affiliate. The limited partnership may not exist for more than ten years from the date of its creation and may not be recreated, renewed, or extended beyond that date. The limited partnership shall not be considered as amending or otherwise altering Title 61 except for the limited purposes permitted in this section in connection with a manufacturer, brewer, or importer of beer or its affiliate who is licensed in this State providing the financial assistance. A manufacturer, brewer, or importer or its affiliate shall not mandate, directly or indirectly, that a wholesaler use the financial assistance as described in this section.

      "text": "(a) Pursuant to a plan of merger approved pursuant to subsection (c), a limited partnership may be merged with or into one or more partnerships, foreign partnerships, corporations, foreign corporations, limited liability companies, foreign limited liability companies, limited partnerships, foreign limited partnerships, or other domestic or foreign entities. (b) A plan of merger includes the: (1) name of each entity that is a party to the merger; (2) name of the surviving entity into which the other entities are to merge; (3) type of organization of the surviving entity; (4) terms and conditions of the merger; (5) manner and basis for converting the interests of each party to the merger into interests or obligations of the surviving entity or into money or other property in whole or in part; and (6) street address of the surviving entity's principal place of business. (c) A plan of merger must be approved by: (1) all the partners or the number or percentage of the partners required for merger in the partnership agreement, in the case of a partnership or a domestic limited partnership that is a party to the merger; (2) all the members or the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement, in the case of a limited liability company that is a party to the merger; (3) the vote required for approval of a merger by the law of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the foreign limited liability company is organized, in the case of a foreign limited liability company that is a party to the merger; or (4) the vote required for approval of a merger by the law of this State or of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the entity is organized and, in the absence of that requirement, by all the owners of interests in the entity, in the case of any other entities that are parties to the merger. (d) After a plan of merger is approved and before the merger takes effect, the plan may be amended or abandoned as provided in the plan. (e) The merger is effective upon the filing of the articles of merger with the Secretary of State or at a later date the articles may provide. (f)(1) If a limited partnership that owns real property in South Carolina is converted to another entity by articles of merger, the newly-named surviving, acquiring, or reorganizing partnership must file a notice of that name change in the office of the register of deeds of the county in South Carolina in which the real property is located. If there is no office in that county, the notice of name change must be filed with the clerk of court of the county in which that real property is located. (2) The filing must be by: (i) affidavit executed in accordance with the provisions in Section 33-1-200 and containing the old and new names of the limited partnership and describing the real property owned by that limited partnership; or (ii) filing a certified copy of the articles of merger including a description of the real property; or (iii) a duly recorded deed of conveyance to the newly-named surviving, acquiring, or reorganizing partnership. (3) The affidavit or filed articles must be duly indexed in the index of deeds. (4) The purpose of this subitem is to establish record notice pursuant to Chapter 7 of Title 30. Failure to make the required filing of a limited partnership name change does not affect the legality, force, effect, or enforceability as between the parties of any conveyance or other transaction involving real estate owned by the affected limited partnership that is made after the change in name.

The articles must include: (1) the name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each of the limited partnerships and other entities that are parties to the merger; (2) for each limited partnership that is to merge, the date its certificate of limited partnership was filed with the Secretary of State; (3) that a plan of merger has been approved by the required votes and signed by each limited partnership or other entity that is to merge; (4) the name and address of the surviving limited partnership or other surviving entity; (5) the effective date of the merger; (6) if a limited partnership is the surviving entity, changes in its certificate of limited partnership necessary by reason of the merger; (7) if a foreign entity is a party to the merger, the jurisdiction and date of filing of its articles of incorporation, articles of organization, certificate of limited partnership, or other organizational document, if any, and the date its application for authority was filed by the Secretary of State or, if an application has not been filed, a statement to that effect; and (8) if the surviving entity is a foreign entity, an agreement that the surviving entity may be served with process in this State and is subject to liability in any action or proceeding for the enforcement of any liability or obligation of a merging limited partnership previously subject to suit in this State, and for the enforcement, as provided in this chapter, of the right of partners of the limited partnership to receive payment for their interests against the surviving entity. (b) If a foreign corporation, limited liability company, or partnership is the surviving entity of a merger, it shall not do business in this State until an application for authority is filed with the Secretary of State. (c) The surviving limited partnership or other entity shall furnish a copy of the plan of merger, on request and without cost, to a partner of a limited partnership or person holding an interest in another entity that is to merge. (d) Articles of merger operate as an amendment to the limited partnership's certificate of limited partnership. HISTORY: 2004 Act No. 221, Section 3.",

(b) Unless the surviving entity is a partnership, the Secretary of State is an agent for service of process in an action or proceeding against the surviving foreign entity to enforce an obligation of any party to a merger if the surviving foreign entity fails to appoint or maintain an agent designated for service of process in this State or the agent for service of process cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the registered office. Upon receipt of process, the Secretary of State shall send a copy of the process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the surviving entity at the address set forth in the articles of merger. Service is effected pursuant to this subsection at the earliest of: (1) the date the entity receives the process, notice, or demand; (2) the date shown on the return receipt, if signed on behalf of the entity; or (3) five days after its deposit in the mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed. (c) A partner of a merging limited partnership is liable for all obligations as a party to the merger for which the partner was personally liable before the merger. (d) Unless otherwise agreed, a merger of a limited partnership that is not the surviving entity in the merger does not require the limited partnership to wind up its business or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets pursuant to this chapter.
