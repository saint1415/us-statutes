To the extent that a communications service provider is an attacher only, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall confine their inspection, audit, and examination to the attachers' compliance with attacher obligations pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, and agreements. The Office of Regulatory Staff shall provide notice of the complaint to each communications service provider, broadband affiliate, or electric cooperative named in the complaint. The provisions of Section 58-4-55 including, but not limited to, the treatment of information deemed confidential or proprietary, shall apply to any such inspections, audits, and examinations. Information deemed confidential or proprietary must be made available to other parties or to the complaint only pursuant to the terms and conditions of an appropriate nondisclosure agreement. If the parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions, the commission shall provide the parties an opportunity to be heard and then establish the terms and conditions of an appropriate nondisclosure agreement. (2) Unless the parties to the complaint agree otherwise, the Office of Regulatory Staff must complete its inspection, audit, and examination within forty-five days of issuance of the complaint initiated by a communications service provider, electric cooperative, or a broadband affiliate. Upon completion of an authorized inspection, audit, and examination, the Office of Regulatory Staff must report its findings to the management and board of the electric cooperative, broadband affiliate or the communications service provider that is the subject of the complaint and to the party that made the complaint. The Office of Regulatory Staff will attempt to resolve with the management and board of the electric cooperative, broadband affiliate, or the management of the communications service provider any compliance issues that are identified. The commission is vested with the authority and jurisdiction, upon the filing of a complaint, to determine any disputed issues arising from the inspection, audit, and examination and any issues arising from or under the provisions of Sections 58-9-3030 and 58-9-3050 that are not resolved pursuant to this subsection. In determining such issues, and only to the extent necessary to resolve such disputed issues, the commission is granted authority and jurisdiction over any and all electric cooperatives, broadband affiliates, and communications service providers that conduct any activities pursuant to Sections 58-9-3030 and 58-9-3050.

These restrictions do not apply to the extent a cooperative has or seeks membership in the association. (4) For purposes of this section, \"an individual with whom he is associated\" has the same meaning as provided in Section 8-13-100(21) and \"family member\" has the same meaning as provided in Section 8-13-100(15).

Subject to the provisions of Section 58-27-1360, the act of incorporating or annexing into a city or town an area in which the cooperative is serving constitutes the consent of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to continue serving all premises then being served by the cooperative and such cooperative is empowered to so serve. A cooperative shall not extend service to any premises initially requiring electric service after February 19, 2004 in any part of any city or town unless: (a) such premises is within the municipal limits of the city or town as those municipal limits existed on February 19, 2004 and either: (i) the cooperative was the principal supplier of electricity to the city or town or (ii) the cooperative had the legal right to serve such premises prior to February 19, 2004, and the cooperative is empowered to so serve unless the governing body of such city or town directs otherwise; or (b) such premises is located in an area annexed or incorporated after February 19, 2004 and is either: (i) within an area assigned to the cooperative by the commission pursuant to Act 432 of 1969, prior to annexation or incorporation, including corridors which lie within the boundaries of the cooperative's assigned territory, and the act of incorporating or annexing such area constitutes the consent of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to provide such service and the cooperative is empowered to so serve unless the governing body of the city or town directs otherwise; or (ii) within an area left unassigned by the commission prior to annexation or incorporation, including corridors which lie within the boundaries of the unassigned territory, and the act of incorporating or annexing such area constitutes the consent of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to provide such service and the cooperative is empowered to so serve unless the governing body of such city or town directs otherwise. However, a cooperative is not empowered to serve premises first requiring service after annexation into a city or town in which the city or town or a board of public works or a commission of public works provides electric service unless the governing body of the city or town grants its consent to such service by ordinance and the board or commission of public works, if any, authorizes such service by contract. Provided, further, that a cooperative is not empowered to furnish electrical service to any premises first requiring service in an area annexed by a municipality or incorporated after February 19, 2004 where such premises is located: (a) in an area assigned by the commission prior to annexation or incorporation to an electric supplier other than a cooperative or (b) in a corridor lying within the boundaries of an area assigned by the commission prior to annexation or incorporation to an electric supplier other than a cooperative. In the event of a violation of the provisions of this subsection, the municipality or any affected board of public works or commission of public works or any affected supplier of electricity may institute an action in the court of common pleas of the county in which the violation occurs to compel compliance with the provisions of this subsection; (2) to make loans to persons to whom electric energy is or will be supplied by the cooperative for the purpose of, and otherwise to assist such person in, wiring their premises and installing therein electric and plumbing fixtures, appliances, apparatus, and equipment of any and all kinds and character and, in connection therewith, to purchase, acquire, lease, sell, distribute, install, and repair such electric and plumbing fixtures, appliances, apparatus, and equipment and to accept or otherwise acquire and to sell, assign, transfer, endorse, pledge, hypothecate, and otherwise dispose of notes, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness and any and all types of security therefor; (3) to make loans to persons to whom electric energy is or will be supplied by the cooperative for the purpose of, and otherwise to assist such persons in, constructing, maintaining, and operating electric refrigeration plants; (4) to become a member in one or more other cooperatives or corporations or to own stock therein; (5) to construct, purchase, take, receive, lease as lessee or otherwise acquire, to own, hold, use, equip, maintain, and operate and to sell, assign, transfer, convey, exchange, lease as lessor, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or encumber electric transmission and distribution lines or systems, electric generating plants, electric refrigeration plants, lands, buildings, structures, dams, plants, and equipment, and any and all kinds and classes of real or personal property whatsoever which shall be deemed necessary, convenient, or appropriate to accomplish the purpose for which the cooperative is organized; (6) to purchase or otherwise acquire, to own, hold, use, and exercise and to sell, assign, transfer, convey, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of or encumber franchises, rights, privileges, licenses, rights of way, and easements; (7) to borrow money and otherwise contract indebtedness, to issue notes, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness therefor and to secure the payment thereof by mortgage, pledge, deed of trust, or any other encumbrance upon any and all of its then owned or after-acquired real or personal property, assets, franchises, revenues, or income; (8) to construct, maintain, and operate electric transmission and distribution lines along, upon, under, and across all public thoroughfares including, without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, all roads, highways, streets, alleys, bridges, and causeways and upon, under, and across all publicly-owned lands, subject, however, to the requirements in respect of the use of such thoroughfares and lands that are imposed by the respective authorities having jurisdiction thereof upon corporations constructing or operating electric transmission and distribution lines or systems; (9) to exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by the laws of this State for the exercise of that power by corporations constructing or operating electric transmission and distribution lines or systems; (10) to conduct its business and exercise any or all of its powers within or without this State; (11) to do and perform any and all other acts and things and to have and exercise any and all other powers which may be necessary, convenient, or appropriate to accomplish the purpose for which the cooperative is organized; and (12) to wholly or partially own, lease, maintain, construct, install, operate, and replace a broadband network directly or indirectly as provided for and subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in Article 25, Chapter 9, Title 58.

(B) Patronage capital shall be determined by a cooperative on an annual basis and shall be the amount by which the cooperative's electric revenues exceed its costs of doing business. (C) On an annual basis, patronage capital shall be allocated on the books of the cooperative to each member based upon and in proportion to: (1) the revenue from each member or group of similar members; (2) the contribution of each member or group of similar members to the cooperative's overall patronage capital; or (3) any combination of items (1) and (2) as determined by the board of trustees. The allocation of patronage capital to a member's account does not vest until such time that the board determines that retirement is proper pursuant to subsection (D). (D) Retirement of patronage capital is the actual payment, as provided by subsection (E), of patronage capital to the cooperative members to whom it has previously been allocated. The board of trustees of a cooperative may, in its discretion, utilize its business judgment to retire patronage capital as allocated on the books of the cooperative when the retirement is consistent with sound business and management practices and the long-term financial stability of the cooperative. If the board of trustees, in its discretion, utilizes its business judgment to retire patronage capital to members either upon their death, termination of electric service, or bankruptcy, then the retirement may be discounted from the board's approved retirement cycle to present-day value when deemed appropriate by the board of trustees in the exercise of its business judgment. (E) When the board of trustees of the cooperative has determined, pursuant to subsection (D), that patronage capital shall be retired, the retirement may be accomplished by a bill credit or by the mailing of payment or notice of payment to the person's last known address of record on file with the cooperative. No interest shall be paid or payable by the cooperative on any patronage capital furnished by its members. (F) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, S.C. Code of Laws Section 27-18-10, et seq., patronage capital that has been retired by a cooperative but remains unclaimed for a period of seven years shall become abandoned patronage capital. The cooperative shall, nonetheless, pay any validated claims by members or former members for unclaimed or abandoned patronage capital. With respect to abandoned patronage capital, the cooperative must follow the procedures set forth in subsection (G). Each year, the cooperative may impose a reasonable administrative fee for abandoned or unclaimed patronage capital and may offset the fee against such abandoned or unclaimed patronage capital. Abandoned patronage capital shall be designated as equity and, at the board's direction, can be used only by the cooperative for: (1) energy efficiency programs and education; (2) renewable energy initiatives; or (3) educational or charitable purposes. (G) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, S.C. Code of Laws Section 27-18-10, et seq., electric cooperatives must pay any validated claims from members or former members for abandoned patronage capital in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. (1) Patronage capital, presumed abandoned, which is due to members or former members of electric cooperatives organized pursuant to Section 33-49-10 and whose last known address is in South Carolina, may be retained by the electric cooperative provided that the electric cooperative performs the following due diligence duties to locate the rightful owners: (a) the cooperative shall publish, for two consecutive years, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of the cooperative's principal place of business, the names and addresses of each person appearing from the cooperative's records to be the owner of the unclaimed patronage capital of fifty dollars or more, together with instructions on how to claim such property. Such publication will commence within one year after the check representing patronage capital was returned to the cooperative as undeliverable or has gone uncashed; (b) the cooperative shall publish, no less than annually, in its official publication, either in print or electronically, the names and addresses of each person appearing from the cooperative's records to be the owner of unclaimed patronage capital of fifty dollars or more, together with instructions on how to claim such property. Such publication will commence within one year after the check representing patronage capital was returned to the cooperative as undeliverable or has gone uncashed and will continue for the earlier of two consecutive years or until the patronage capital has been paid to the rightful owner; and (c) the cooperative shall maintain a searchable website on which will be listed the names and addresses of each person appearing from the cooperative's records to be the owner of unclaimed and abandoned patronage capital of fifty dollars or more, together with instructions on how to claim the property. The listings will commence within one year after the check representing patronage capital was returned to the cooperative as undeliverable or has gone uncashed and will continue until the patronage capital has been paid to the rightful owner. The Office of State Treasurer shall maintain a link on the state's Unclaimed Property Website to the cooperative's searchable website to increase public awareness and access. (2) A person aggrieved by a decision of the cooperative or whose claim has not been acted upon within ninety days after its filing may bring an action to establish the claim in the court of common pleas of the county of the cooperative's principal place of business. The action must be brought within ninety days after the decision of the cooperative or within one hundred eighty days after the filing of the claim if the cooperative has failed to act on it. (3) The patronage capital accounts still unpaid that were included on previously filed annual unclaimed property reports for which no property was delivered will be returned to the respective cooperatives and will be treated in the same manner as provided by this section for patronage capital. (4) The administrator, as defined in Section 27-18-20(1), shall not be responsible or held liable for any unclaimed patronage capital accounts retained by a cooperative pursuant to this section. (5) The cooperative shall consider each claim filed by a person claiming an interest in patronage capital within ninety days after it is filed and give written notice to the claimant if the claim is denied in whole or in part. If a claim is allowed, the cooperative shall pay over or deliver to the claimant the patronage capital owed to the claimant at the time the patronage capital became abandoned.

(B) A cooperative may indemnify a person who was or is a party to any action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the cooperative), because he is or was a trustee, officer, employee, or agent of the cooperative, or is or was serving at the request of the cooperative as a trustee or director of another cooperative or affiliated organization, against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action if he acted in good faith and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of an action by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Indemnification may be made in respect of any issue for which the person has been adjudged to be liable to the cooperative only to the extent that the officer presiding over the action determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, the person is entitled to indemnity for expenses which the presiding officer considers proper. (C) To the extent a trustee of a cooperative has been successful in defense of an action or in defense of an issue referred to in (B) and (C) of this section, he must be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. (D) An indemnification under (B) and (C) of this section, unless ordered by a court, must be made by the cooperative only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the trustee is proper. The determination must be made (1) by the board of trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of trustees who were not parties to the action, or (2) if a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the members of the cooperative. (E) Expenses incurred by a trustee in defending a civil or criminal action may be paid by the cooperative in advance of the final disposition of the action upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the trustee to repay the amount if it is determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the cooperative. The expenses incurred by other officers or employees and agents may be paid upon terms and conditions the board of trustees considers appropriate. (F) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this section is not exclusive of other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advances of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested trustees, or of other action of the cooperative in his official capacity or in another capacity while holding office. (G) A cooperative may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a trustee or director of the cooperative, or any affiliated organization or who was serving at the request of the cooperative as a trustee of another cooperative, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status, whether or not the cooperative has the power to indemnify him against the liability under this section. (H) The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized by this section, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continues as to a person who has ceased to be a trustee, director, officer or employer, or agent and inures to the benefit of his heirs.

The proposition that the cooperative be dissolved must be submitted to the membership of the cooperative for a vote at a special meeting of the membership called only for this purpose and held on Saturday. Locations for the special meeting must be set up in every county in which the cooperative provides service. The notice for the meeting at which a proposal to dissolve the cooperative is considered shall set forth: (1) a detailed proposition for dissolution; (2) the plan for sale and distribution of assets; (3) the plan for the continuance of service; and (4) the locations of the meeting. The special meeting must be called to order by the president or his designee at each of the locations set forth in the notice. No quorum is required to conduct the business of the special meeting and the presiding officer shall promptly order the balloting on the proposition. A vote by the membership for voluntary dissolution of the cooperative must be by written or machine ballot only. The ballot must state the proposition to be voted upon by the members and must contain two boxes, one marked FOR DISSOLUTION and the other marked AGAINST DISSOLUTION. The ballot must direct that the member place an \"X\" in the box indicating his vote on the proposition. Each member is entitled to one vote on the proposition to dissolve the cooperative. Voting on this proposition must be in person only, except that a member who qualifies to vote an absentee ballot under the categories as designated below may vote by absentee ballot. A member may cast an absentee ballot on the proposition of voluntary dissolution of the cooperative if the member: (1) is serving with the Armed Forces, Merchant Marine of the United States, or is a spouse or dependent residing with that person; (2) is serving in the Red Cross or with the United Service Organizations, who are attached to and serving with the Armed Forces of the United States, or is a spouse or a dependent residing with that person; (3) is physically disabled so as to prevent his attendance at the meeting; (4) has his principal residence outside any county in which the cooperative does business; (5) is attending sick or physically disabled persons; (6) is self-employed or unemployed and by virtue of vacation plans will be absent from his county of residence on the scheduled meeting day; (7) by virtue of vacation plans, will be absent from his county of residence on the scheduled meeting day and the vacation leave having been confirmed by his employer below; or (8) is prevented from attending the meeting due to his employment and his inability to attend the meeting is confirmed by his employer as provided in this section. A member seeking the privilege of voting an absentee ballot must apply to the cooperative in writing for an absentee ballot within thirty days of the date for submission of the absentee ballot as provided herein. The absentee ballot must be promptly forwarded to the member by depositing it in the United States mail to the last known address of the member, together with a form to be completed and signed by the member setting forth and certifying as to his qualification for voting an absentee ballot. The absentee ballot must be sealed in a blank envelope and together with the executed certification of qualification form inserted into a second envelope bearing the name and account number of the member. The ballot and certification of qualification form, so ensealed, must be returned to the cooperative by mail or otherwise no later than twelve noon of the day prior to the date of the special meeting of members. A member receiving an absentee ballot is entitled to cast a vote at the special meeting. However, after delivering an absentee ballot to the cooperative, if the member registers at the meeting or requests in writing the withdrawal of his absentee ballot prior to the close of registration on the meeting date, the absentee ballot must be voided and destroyed. At the conclusion of the membership balloting, each absentee ballot meeting the requirements of this section or which has not been revoked by registration or written member request must be removed from the envelope containing the member's identification, mixed with the other unmarked envelopes so as to prevent identification of the person casting the vote and added to the count of votes cast at the meeting. The meeting must begin at seven a.m. and adjourn at seven p.m. of the day set for a special meeting except that any member who has not cast his ballot and is in the process of voting or is waiting to vote must be allowed to vote. The proposed voluntary dissolution is approved upon affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of the cooperative. The certificate of qualification for voting an absentee ballot must be in the following form: Certificate of Qualification for Absentee Ballot I hereby apply for an absentee ballot to vote on the proposition of the voluntary dissolution of the cooperative at the special meeting to be held on the ___ day of __________, ___. I certify that: ___ (1) I am serving with the Armed Forces, Merchant Marine of the United States, and am prevented by my work relating to this service from attending the meeting, or I am a spouse or dependent who resides with a person so serving. ___ (2) I am serving with the Red Cross or with the United Service Organizations who are attached to and serving with the Armed Forces of the United States, or I am a spouse or dependent who resides with a person so serving. ___ (3) I am physically disabled and am prevented from attending the meeting. ___ (4) My principal residence is outside any county in which the cooperative does business.
