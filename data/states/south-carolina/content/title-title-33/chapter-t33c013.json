      "text": "(a) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under Section 33-13-300 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment under Section 33-13-280. (b) The court also may assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable: (1) against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the corporation did not comply substantially with the requirements of Sections 33-13-200 through 33-13-280; or (2) against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter. (c) If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited. (d) In a proceeding commenced by dissenters to enforce the liability under Section 33-13-300(a) of a corporation that has failed to commence an appraisal proceeding within the sixty-day period, the court shall assess the costs of the proceeding and the fees and expenses of dissenters' counsel against the corporation and in favor of the dissenters.
