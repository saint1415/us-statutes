(b) The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, written contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation. (c) Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. (d) When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the corporation must place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or for a promissory note. Any share dividends in respect of the shares escrowed also must be placed in escrow. Distributions in respect of escrowed shares must be escrowed or credited against their purchase price. The shares and distributions escrowed must remain in escrow until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits are received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed and the distributions credited may be canceled in whole or in part and the distributions escrowed may be reclaimed by the corporation. (f) A corporation subject to the registration requirements of Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may issue shares for a contract for future services without having to place the shares and share dividends and distributions in respect of the shares in escrow and without having to credit distributions against their purchase price if the shares are issued or authorized pursuant to a plan that has been approved by the shareholders of the corporation.

(b) Unless a statement is included in the articles of incorporation that 'the corporation elects not to have preemptive rights' (or words of similar import), the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise: (1) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them. (2) A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration. (3) There is no preemptive right with respect to: (i) shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or affiliates; (ii) shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or affiliates; (iii) shares authorized in the articles of incorporation that are issued within six months from the effective date of incorporation; (iv) shares sold otherwise than for money. (4) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class. (5) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights. (6) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights. (c) For purposes of this section, \"shares\" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares. (d) The sale or other disposition by the corporation of shares or securities not subject to a preemptive right under this section, or under the articles of incorporation as permitted by this section, shall not impair any remedy which any shareholder may have for a breach of duty by the board of directors.

      "text": "(a) A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c). (b) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than one involving a repurchase or reacquisition of shares), it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution. (c) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect: (1) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (2) the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (d) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (c) either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (e) The effect of a distribution under subsection (c) is measured: (1) in the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation or (ii) the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares; (2) in the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; (3) in all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization or (ii) the date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization. (f) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
