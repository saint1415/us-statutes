(b) \"Cause\" for removal of a director under this subsection means fraudulent or dishonest acts, gross abuse of authority in the discharge of duties to the telephone cooperative, or failure to adhere to such obligations, duties, or qualifications as the bylaws may prescribe. Cause may not be found unless written notice of the specific charges and opportunity to meet and refute such charges has been provided to the director. (c) If a removal occurs pursuant to this subsection, a successor must be elected as provided by the bylaws of the telephone cooperative. (2) Two-thirds of the members present and voting at a meeting legally called according to the bylaws of the telephone cooperative may remove any director, with or without cause.
