However, for occupational disease claims the two-year period does not begin to run until the employee concerned has been diagnosed definitively as having an occupational disease and has been notified of the diagnosis. For the death or injury of a member of the South Carolina National Guard, as provided for in Section 42-7-67, the time for filing a claim is two years after the accident or one year after the federal claim is finalized, whichever is later. The filing required by this section may be made by registered mail, and the service within the time periods set forth in this section constitutes timely filing. For a \"repetitive trauma injury\" as defined in Section 42-1-172, the right to compensation is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission within two years after the employee knew or should have known that his injury is compensable but no more than seven years after the last date of injurious exposure. This section applies regardless of whether the employee was aware that his repetitive trauma injury was the result of his employment.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 72-303; 1952 Code Section 72-303; 1942 Code Section 7035-27; 1936 (39) 1231; 1955 (49) 319; 1974 (58) 2265; 1978 Act No. 522 Section 6; 1979 Act No. 194 Part III Section 6; 1990 Act No. 612, Part II, Section 15C, eff June 13, 1990 (became law without the Governor's signature); 2007 Act No. 111, Pt I, Section 26, eff July 1, 2007, applicable to injuries that occur on or after that date.",

The refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical, or other treatment or evaluation when provided by the employer or ordered by the commission bars the employee from further compensation until the refusal ceases and compensation is not paid for the period of refusal unless in the opinion of the commission the circumstances justified the refusal, in which case the commission may order a change in the medical or hospital service.

If the employee is entitled to receive such benefits, the medical treatment or modalities to be provided must be set forth with as much specificity as possible in the single commissioner's order or the commission's order.\n\n(3) In no case shall an employer be required to provide medical treatment or modalities in any case where there is a lapse in treatment of the employee by an authorized physician in excess of one year unless:\n\n(a) the settlement agreement or commission order provides otherwise; or\n\n(b) the employee has made reasonable attempts to obtain further treatment or modality from an authorized physician, but through no fault of the employee's own, is unable to obtain such treatment or modalities.\n\n(C) In cases in which total and permanent disability results, reasonable and necessary nursing services, medicines, prosthetic devices, sick travel, medical, hospital, and other treatment or care shall be paid during the life of the injured employee, without regard to any limitation in this title including the maximum compensation limit.
