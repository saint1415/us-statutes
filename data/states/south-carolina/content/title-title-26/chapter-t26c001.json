The notice must be of conspicuous size, if in writing, and must state: \"I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND I MAY NOT GIVE LEGAL ADVICE OR ACCEPT FEES FOR LEGAL ADVICE.\" The notice must provide the fees for notarial acts specified in Section 26-1-100. If the advertisement is by radio or television, the statement may be modified but must include substantially the same message. (J) A notary public who is not an attorney licensed to practice law in this State may not render a service that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. A nonattorney notary may not assist another person in drafting, completing, selecting, or understanding a record or transaction requiring a notarial act. This subsection does not prohibit an employee of any court within the unified judiciary system, acting within the scope of his employment, from assisting an individual with filing a document with the court, provided that the assistance does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. (K) A notary may not claim to have powers, qualifications, rights, or privileges that the office of notary does not provide, including the power to counsel on immigration matters. (L) A notary may not use the term \"notario publico\" or any equivalent non-English term in any business card, advertisement, notice, or sign.
