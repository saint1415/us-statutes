An attempt to increase the speed of a vehicle or in other manner avoid the pursuing law enforcement vehicle when signaled by a siren or flashing light is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. Failure to see the flashing light or hear the siren does not excuse a failure to stop when the distance between the vehicles and other road conditions are such that it would be reasonable for a driver to hear or see the signals from the law enforcement vehicle.\n\n(B) A person who violates the provisions of subsection (A):\n\n(1) for a first offense where no great bodily injury or death resulted from the violation, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not less than ninety days nor more than three years. The Department of Motor Vehicles must suspend the person's driver's license for at least thirty days; or\n\n(2) for a second or subsequent offense where no great bodily injury or death resulted from the violation, is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not more than five years. The person's driver's license must be suspended by the department for a period of one year from the date of the conviction.\n\n(C) A person who violates the provisions of subsection (A) and when driving performs an act forbidden by law or neglects a duty imposed by law in the driving of the vehicle:\n\n(1) where great bodily injury resulted, is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not more than ten years; or\n\n(2) where death resulted, is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not more than twenty-five years.\n\n(D) The department must revoke the driver's license of any person who is convicted pursuant to subsection (C)(1) or (C)(2) for a period to include any term of imprisonment, suspended sentence, parole, or probation, plus three years.\n\n(E) \"Great bodily injury\" means bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss of or impairment of the function of a bodily member or organ.\n\n(F) After a conviction pursuant to subsection (B)(1) for a first offense, the person may, after three years from the date of completion of all terms and conditions of his sentence for the first offense, apply, or cause someone acting on his behalf to apply, to the court for an order expunging the records of the arrest and conviction. This provision does not apply to any crime classified as a felony. If the person has had no other conviction during the three-year period following the completion of the terms and conditions of the sentence, the court shall issue an order expunging the records. No person has any rights under this section more than one time. After the expungement, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the Department of Motor Vehicles are required to keep a nonpublic record of the offense and the date of its expungement to ensure that no person takes advantage of the rights permitted by this subsection more than once. This nonpublic record is not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act or any other provision of law except to those authorized law or court officials who need to know this information in order to prevent the rights afforded by this subsection from being taken advantage of more than once.\n\n(G)(1) If a person is employed or enrolled in a college or university at any time while his driver's license is suspended pursuant to subsection (B) of this section, he may apply for a special restricted driver's license permitting him to drive only to and from work or his place of education and in the course of his employment or education during the period of suspension. The department may issue the special restricted driver's license only upon a showing by the person that he is employed or enrolled in a college or university, and that he lives further than one mile from his place of employment or place of education.\n\n(2) If the department issues a special restricted driver's license, it shall designate reasonable restrictions on the times during which and routes on which the person may operate a motor vehicle. A change in the employment hours, place of employment, status as a student, or residence must be reported immediately to the department by the licensee.\n\n(3) The fee for each special restricted driver's license is one hundred dollars, but no additional fee is due because of changes in the place and hours of employment, education, or residence. Of this fee twenty dollars must be distributed to the general fund and eighty dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into the State Highway Fund as established by Section 57-11-20, to be distributed as provided in Section 11-43-167.\n\n(4) The operation of a motor vehicle outside the time limits and route imposed by a special restricted license by the person issued that license is a violation of Section 56-1-460.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-359; 1968 (55) 2497; 1988 Act No. 532, Section 14; 1993 Act No. 184, Section 251; 1995 Act No. 65, Section 1; 1996 Act No. 459, Section 180; 1999 Act No. 115, Section 6; 2001 Act No. 79, Section 2.H; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Section 73, eff July 1, 2016.",

An assessment of the extent and nature of the alcohol and drug abuse problem of the applicant must be prepared and a plan of education or treatment, or both, must be developed for the applicant. The Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program shall determine if the applicant successfully has completed the services. The applicant must attend the first Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program available after the date of enrollment. The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services shall determine the cost of services provided by each certified Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. Each applicant shall bear the cost of services recommended in the applicant's plan of education or treatment. The cost may not exceed five hundred dollars for education services, two thousand dollars for treatment services, and two thousand five hundred dollars in total for all services. An applicant may not be denied services due to an inability to pay. Inability to pay for services may not be used as a factor in determining if the applicant has successfully completed services. An applicant who is unable to pay for services shall perform fifty hours of community service as arranged by the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, which may use the completion of this community service as a factor in determining if the applicant successfully has completed services. The court must be notified whether an offender failed to enroll in a certified program within thirty days or failed to participate in the plan of education or treatment. The court may hold the individual in contempt of court if the individual cannot show cause as to why no enrollment occurred within the mandated thirty days or why no progress has been made on the plan of education or treatment.\n\n(I) A person charged for a violation of this section may be prosecuted pursuant to Section 56-5-2933 if the original testing of the person's breath or collection of other bodily fluids was performed within two hours of the time of arrest and reasonable suspicion existed to justify the traffic stop. A person may not be prosecuted for both a violation of this section and a violation of Section 56-5-2933 for the same incident.

      "text": "(A) It is unlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle within this State while his alcohol concentration is eight one-hundredths of one percent or more. A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of the offense of driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration and, upon conviction, entry of a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or forfeiture of bail must be punished as follows:\n\n(1) for a first offense, by a fine of four hundred dollars or imprisonment for not less than forty-eight hours nor more than thirty days. However, in lieu of the forty-eight hour minimum imprisonment, the court may provide for forty-eight hours of public service employment. The minimum forty-eight hour imprisonment or public service employment must be served at a time when the person is not working and does not interfere with his regular employment under terms and conditions the court considers proper. However, the court may not compel an offender to perform public service employment in lieu of the minimum forty-eight hour sentence. If the person's alcohol concentration is at least ten one-hundredths of one percent but less than sixteen one-hundredths of one percent, then the person must be punished by a fine of five hundred dollars or imprisonment for not less than seventy-two hours nor more than thirty days. However, in lieu of the seventy-two hour minimum imprisonment, the court may provide for seventy-two hours of public service employment. The minimum seventy-two hour imprisonment or public service employment must be served at a time when the person is not working and does not interfere with his regular employment under terms and conditions as the court considers proper. However, the court may not compel an offender to perform public service employment in lieu of the minimum sentence. If the person's alcohol concentration is sixteen one-hundredths of one percent or more, then the person must be punished by a fine of one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days. However, in lieu of the thirty-day minimum imprisonment, the court may provide for thirty days of public service employment. The minimum thirty days imprisonment or public service employment must be served at a time when the person is not working and does not interfere with his regular employment under terms and conditions as the court considers proper. However, the court may not compel an offender to perform public service employment instead of the thirty-day minimum sentence. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 22-3-540, 22-3-545, and 22-3-550, a first offense charged for this item may be tried in magistrates court;\n\n(2) for a second offense, by a fine of not less than two thousand one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand one hundred dollars, and imprisonment for not less than five days nor more than one year. However, the fine imposed by this item must not be suspended in an amount less than one thousand one hundred dollars. If the person's alcohol concentration is at least ten one-hundredths of one percent but less than sixteen one-hundredths of one percent, then the person must be punished by a fine of not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand five hundred dollars and imprisonment for not less than thirty days nor more than two years. However, the fine imposed by this item must not be suspended in an amount less than one thousand one hundred dollars. If the person's alcohol concentration is sixteen one-hundredths of one percent or more, then the person must be punished by a fine of not less than three thousand five hundred dollars nor more than six thousand five hundred dollars and imprisonment for not less than ninety days nor more than three years. However, the fine imposed by this item must not be suspended in an amount less than one thousand one hundred dollars;\n\n(3) for a third offense, by a fine of not less than three thousand eight hundred dollars nor more than six thousand three hundred dollars, and imprisonment for not less than sixty days nor more than three years. If the person's alcohol concentration is at least ten one-hundredths of one percent but less than sixteen one-hundredths of one percent, then the person must be punished by a fine of not less than five thousand dollars nor more than seven thousand five hundred dollars and imprisonment for not less than ninety days nor more than four years. If the person's alcohol concentration is sixteen one-hundredths of one percent or more, then the person must be punished by a fine of not less than seven thousand five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars and imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than five years; or\n\n(4) for a fourth or subsequent offense, by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than five years. If the person's alcohol concentration is at least ten one-hundredths of one percent but less than sixteen one-hundredths of one percent, then the person must be punished by imprisonment for not less than two years nor more than six years. If the person's alcohol concentration is sixteen one-hundredths of one percent or more, then the person must be punished by imprisonment for not less than three years nor more than seven years.\n\n(B) No part of the minimum sentences provided in this section may be suspended. Instead of public service employment the court may invoke another sentence provided in this section. For a second or subsequent offense of this section, the service of the minimum sentence is mandatory. However, the judge may provide for the sentence to be served upon terms and conditions as he considers proper including, but not limited to, weekend service or nighttime service in any fashion he considers necessary.\n\n(C) The fine for a first offense must not be suspended. The court is prohibited from suspending a monetary fine below that of the next preceding minimum monetary fine.\n\n(D) For the purposes of this chapter a conviction, entry of a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or forfeiture of bail for the violation of a law or ordinance of this or another state or a municipality of this or another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or narcotics, including, but not limited to, Section 56-5-2930, or prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle with an unlawful alcohol concentration, including, but not limited to, this section, constitutes a prior offense of this section. Only those violations which occurred within a period of ten years including and immediately preceding the date of the last violation constitute prior violations within the meaning of this section.\n\n(E) Upon imposition of a sentence of public service, the defendant may apply to the court to be allowed to perform his public service in his county of residence if he has been sentenced to public service in a county where he does not reside.\n\n(F) One hundred dollars of each fine imposed pursuant to this section must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the Department of Public Safety for the Highway Patrol.\n\n(G) Two hundred dollars of the fine imposed pursuant to subsections (A)(3) must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the State Law Enforcement Division to offset the costs of administration of the breath testing devices, breath testing site video program, and toxicology laboratory.\n\n(H) A person convicted of violating this section, whether for a first offense or subsequent offense, must enroll in and successfully complete an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program certified by the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. An assessment of the extent and nature of the alcohol and drug abuse problem of the applicant must be prepared and a plan of education or treatment, or both, must be developed for the applicant. The Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program shall determine if the applicant successfully has completed the services. The applicant must attend the first Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program available after the date of enrollment. The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services shall determine the cost of services provided by each certified Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. Each applicant shall bear the cost of services recommended in the applicant's plan of education or treatment. The cost may not exceed five hundred dollars for education services, two thousand dollars for treatment services, and two thousand five hundred dollars in total for all services. An applicant may not be denied services due to an inability to pay. Inability to pay for services may not be used as a factor in determining if the applicant successfully has completed services. An applicant who is unable to pay for services shall perform fifty hours of community service as arranged by the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, which may use the completion of this community service as a factor in determining if the applicant successfully has completed services. The court must be notified whether an offender failed to enroll in a certified program within thirty days or failed to participate in the plan of education or treatment. The court may hold the individual in contempt of court if the individual cannot show cause as to why no enrollment occurred within the mandated thirty days or why no progress has been made on the plan of education or treatment.\n\n(I) A person charged for a violation of Section 56-5-2930 may be prosecuted pursuant to this section if the original testing of the person's breath or collection of other bodily fluids was performed within two hours of the time of arrest and reasonable suspicion existed to justify the traffic stop. A person may not be prosecuted for both a violation of Section 56-5-2930 and a violation of this section for the same incident. A person who violates the provisions of this section is entitled to a jury trial and is afforded the right to challenge certain factors including the following:\n\n(1) whether or not the person was lawfully arrested or detained;\n\n(2) the period of time between arrest and testing;\n\n(3) whether or not the person was given a written copy of and verbally informed of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-2950;\n\n(4) whether the person consented to taking a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, and whether the:\n\n(a) reported alcohol concentration at the time of testing was eight one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(b) individual who administered the test or took samples was qualified pursuant to Section 56-5-2950;\n\n(c) tests administered and samples obtained were conducted pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 56-5-2951(O) and Section 56-5-2953(F); and\n\n(d) machine was working properly.\n\n(J) Nothing contained in this section prohibits the introduction of:\n\n(1) the results of any additional tests of the person's breath or other bodily fluids;\n\n(2) any evidence that may corroborate or question the validity of the breath or bodily fluid test result including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) evidence of field sobriety tests;\n\n(b) evidence of the amount of alcohol consumed by the person; and\n\n(c) evidence of the person's driving;\n\n(3) a video recording of the person's conduct at the incident site and breath testing site taken pursuant to Section 56-5-2953 which is subject to redaction under the South Carolina Rules of Evidence; or\n\n(4) any other evidence of the state of a person's faculties to drive which would call into question the results of a breath or bodily fluid test.\n\nAt trial, a person charged with a violation of this section is allowed to present evidence relating to the factors enumerated above and the totality of the evidence produced at trial may be used by the jury to determine guilt or innocence. A person charged with a violation of this section must be given notice of intent to prosecute under the provisions of this section at least thirty calendar days before his trial date.\n\n(K) For the purpose of this section, any offense carrying a penalty of imprisonment of ninety days or less may be tried in magistrates court.\n\n(L) In cases in which enhanced penalties for higher levels of alcohol concentration may be applicable, upon the determination of guilt, the finder of fact shall determine the alcohol concentration and the judge shall apply the appropriate penalty.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 390; 2003 Act No. 61, Section 5; 2008 Act No. 201, Section 5, eff February 10, 2009.",

      "text": "(A)(1) The Department of Motor Vehicles shall require a person who is convicted of violating the provisions of Sections 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, 56-5-2947 except if the conviction was for Section 56-5-750, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or who is issued a temporary alcohol license pursuant to Section 56-1-286 or 56-5-2951, to have installed on any motor vehicle the person drives, except a moped or motorcycle, an ignition interlock device designed to prevent driving of the motor vehicle if the person has consumed alcoholic beverages. This requirement shall not apply to a person who submitted to a breath test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and had an alcohol concentration of .00 one-hundredths of one percent.\n\n(2) The department may waive the requirements of this section if the department determines that the person has a medical condition that makes the person incapable of properly operating the installed device. If the department grants a medical waiver, the department shall suspend the person's driver's license for the length of time that the person would have been required to hold an ignition interlock restricted license. The department may withdraw the waiver at any time that the department becomes aware that the person's medical condition has improved to the extent that the person has become capable of properly operating an installed device.\n\n(3) The department also shall require a person who has enrolled in the Ignition Interlock Device Program in lieu of the remainder of a driver's license suspension, denial of license to operate a vehicle as an habitual offender pursuant to Section 56-1-1090, or denial of the issuance of a driver's license or permit to have an ignition interlock device installed on any motor vehicle the person drives, except a moped or motorcycle.\n\n(4) The length of time that a device is required to be affixed to a motor vehicle is set forth in Section 56-1-286; 56-1-1090; 56-5-2945; 56-5-2951; 56-5-2990; or 56-5-2947, except if the conviction was for Section 56-5-750.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require installation of an ignition interlock device until the suspension is upheld at a contested case hearing or the contested hearing is waived.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the pleadings, for purposes of a second or a subsequent offense, the specified length of time that a device is required to be affixed to a motor vehicle is based on the Department of Motor Vehicle's records for offenses pursuant to Section 56-1-286; 56-1-1090; 56-5-2930; 56-5-2933; 56-5-2945; 56-5-2950; 56-5-2951; or 56-5-2947, except if the conviction was for Section 56-5-750.\n\n(C) If a resident of this State is convicted of violating a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, and, as a result of the conviction, the person is subject to an ignition interlock device requirement in the other state, the person is subject to the requirements of this section for the length of time that would have been required for an offense committed in South Carolina, or for the length of time that is required by the other state, whichever is longer.\n\n(D) If a person from another state becomes a resident of South Carolina while subject to an ignition interlock device requirement in another state, the person only may obtain a South Carolina driver's license if the person enrolls in the South Carolina Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to this section. The person is subject to the requirements of this section for the length of time that would have been required for an offense committed in South Carolina, or for the length of time that is required by the other state, whichever is longer.\n\n(E) The person must be subject to an Ignition Interlock Device Point System managed by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. A person accumulating a total of:\n\n(1) two points or more, but less than three points, must have the length of time that the device is required extended by two months;\n\n(2) three points or more, but less than four points, must have the length of time that the device is required extended by four months, shall submit to a substance abuse assessment pursuant to Section 56-5-2990, and shall successfully complete the plan of education and treatment, or both, as recommended by the certified substance abuse program. Should the person not complete the recommended plan, or not make progress toward completing the plan, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall suspend the person's ignition interlock restricted license until the plan is completed or progress is being made toward completing the plan;\n\n(3) four points or more must have the person's ignition interlock restricted license suspended for a period of six months, shall submit to a substance abuse assessment pursuant to Section 56-5-2990, and successfully shall complete the plan of education and treatment, or both, as recommended by the certified substance abuse program. Should the person not complete the recommended plan or not make progress toward completing the plan, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall leave the person's ignition interlock restricted license in suspended status, or, if the license has already been reinstated following the six-month suspension, shall resuspend the person's ignition interlock restricted license until the plan is completed or progress is being made toward completing the plan. The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services is responsible for notifying the Department of Motor Vehicles of a person's completion and compliance with education and treatment programs. Upon reinstatement of driving privileges following the six-month suspension, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall reset the person's point total to zero points, and the person shall complete the remaining period of time on the ignition interlock device.\n\n(F) The cost of the device must be borne by the person. However, unless a person is participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program as an habitual offender pursuant to Section 56-1-1090(A), if the person is indigent and cannot afford the cost of the device, the person may submit an affidavit of indigency to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for a determination of indigency as it pertains to the cost of the device. The affidavit of indigency form must be made publicly accessible on the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' internet website. If the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services determines that the person is indigent as it pertains to the device, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may authorize a device to be affixed to the motor vehicle and the cost of the initial installation and standard use of the device to be paid for by the Ignition Interlock Device Fund managed by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. Funds remitted to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for the Ignition Interlock Device Fund also may be used by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services to support the Ignition Interlock Device Program. For purposes of this section, a person is indigent if the person is financially unable to afford the cost of the ignition interlock device. In making a determination whether a person is indigent, all factors concerning the person's financial conditions should be considered including, but not limited to, income, debts, assets, number of dependents claimed for tax purposes, living expenses, and family situation. A presumption that the person is indigent is created if the person's net family income is less than or equal to the poverty guidelines established and revised annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services published in the Federal Register. \"Net income\" means gross income minus deductions required by law. The determination of indigency is subject to periodic review at the discretion of the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services.\n\n(G) The ignition interlock service provider shall collect and remit monthly to the Ignition Interlock Device Fund a fee as determined by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services not to exceed thirty dollars per month for each month the person is required to drive a vehicle with a device. A service provider who fails to properly remit funds to the Ignition Interlock Device Fund may be decertified as a service provider by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. If a service provider is decertified for failing to remit funds to the Ignition Interlock Device Fund, the cost for removal and replacement of a device must be borne by the service provider.\n\n(H)(1) The person shall have the device inspected every sixty days to verify that the device is affixed to the motor vehicle and properly operating, and to allow for the preparation of an ignition interlock device inspection report by the service provider indicating the person's alcohol content at each attempt to start and running retest during each sixty-day period. Failure of the person to have the interlock device inspected every sixty days must result in one ignition interlock device point.\n\n(2) Only a service provider authorized by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services to perform inspections on ignition interlock devices may conduct inspections. The service provider immediately shall report devices that fail inspection to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The report must contain the person's name, identify the vehicle upon which the failed device is installed, and the reason for the failed inspection.\n\n(3) If the inspection report reflects that the person has failed to complete a running retest, the person must be assessed one ignition interlock device point.\n\n(4) If any inspection report or any photographic images collected by the device shows that the person has violated subsection (M), (O), or (P), the person must be assessed one and one-half ignition interlock device points.\n\n(5) The inspection report must indicate the person's alcohol content at each attempt to start and running retest during each sixty-day period. If the report reflects that the person violated a running retest by having an alcohol concentration of:\n\n(a) two one-hundredths of one percent or more but less than four one-hundredths of one percent, the person must be assessed one-half ignition interlock device point;\n\n(b) four one-hundredths of one percent or more but less than fifteen one-hundredths of one percent, the person must be assessed one ignition interlock device point; or\n\n(c) fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more, the person must be assessed two ignition interlock device points.\n\n(6) A person may appeal less than four ignition interlock device points received to an administrative hearing officer with the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services through a process established by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The administrative hearing officer's decision on appeal is final and no appeal from such decision is allowed.\n\n(I)(1) If a person's license is suspended due to the accumulation of four or more ignition interlock device points, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services must provide a notice of assessment of ignition interlock points which must advise the person of his right to request a contested case hearing before the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings. The notice of assessment of ignition interlock points also must advise the person that, if he does not request a contested case hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of assessment of ignition interlock points, he waives his right to the administrative hearing and the person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to subsection (E).\n\n(2) The person may seek relief from the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' determination that a person's license is suspended due to the accumulation of four or more ignition interlock device points by filing a request for a contested case hearing with the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act. The filing of the request for a contested case hearing will stay the driver's license suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. However, the filing of the request for a contested case hearing will not stay the requirements of the person having the ignition interlock device.\n\n(3) At the contested case hearing:\n\n(a) the assessment of driver's license suspension can be upheld;\n\n(b) the driver's license suspension can be overturned, or any or all of the contested ignition interlock points included in the device inspection report that results in the contested suspension can be overturned, and the penalties as specified pursuant to subsection (E) will then be imposed accordingly.\n\n(4) A contested case hearing must be held after the request for the hearing is received by the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings. Nothing in this section prohibits the introduction of evidence at the contested case hearing on the issue of the accuracy of the ignition interlock device. However, if the ignition interlock device is found to not be in working order due to failure of regular maintenance and upkeep by the person challenging the accumulation of ignition interlock points pursuant to the requirement of the ignition interlock program, such allegation cannot serve as a basis to overturn point accumulations.\n\n(5) A written order must be issued by the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings to all parties either reversing or upholding the assessment of ignition interlock points.\n\n(6) A contested case hearing is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, and a person has a right to appeal the decision of the hearing officer pursuant to that act to the Administrative Law Court in accordance with its appellate rules. The filing of an appeal does not stay the ignition interlock requirement.\n\n(J) Five years from the date of the person's driver's license reinstatement and every five years thereafter, a fourth or subsequent offender whose license has been reinstated pursuant to Section 56-1-385, or a person with a lifetime ignition interlock requirement due to a conviction on or after October 1, 2014, may apply to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for removal of the ignition interlock device and the removal of the restriction from the person's driver's license. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may, for good cause shown, notify the Department of Motor Vehicles that the person is eligible to have the restriction removed from the person's license.\n\n(K)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it is unlawful for a person who is subject to the provisions of this section to drive a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a properly operating, certified ignition interlock device. A person who violates this subsection:\n\n(a) for a first offense, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year. The person must have the length of time that the ignition interlock device is required extended by six months;\n\n(b) for a second offense, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than three years. The person must have the length of time that the ignition interlock device is required extended by one year; and\n\n(c) for a third or subsequent offense, is guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years. The person must have the length of time that the ignition interlock device is required extended by three years.\n\n(2) No portion of the minimum sentence imposed pursuant to this subsection may be suspended.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a first or second offense punishable pursuant to this subsection may be tried in summary court.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a person who is participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-1-1090(A) and who drives a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a properly operating, certified ignition interlock device from being charged with a violation of Section 56-1-1100, or Section 56-1-1105.\n\n(L)(1) A person who is required in the course and scope of the person's employment to drive a motor vehicle owned by the person's employer may drive the employer's motor vehicle without installation of an ignition interlock device, provided that the person's use of the employer's motor vehicle is solely for the employer's business purposes.\n\n(2) This subsection does not apply to:\n\n(a) a person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, unless the person's driving privileges have been suspended for not less than one year or the person has had an ignition interlock device installed for not less than one year on each of the motor vehicles owned or operated, or both, by the person;\n\n(b) a person who is self-employed or to a person who is employed by a business owned in whole or in part by the person or a member of the person's household or immediate family unless during the defense of a criminal charge, the court finds that the vehicle's ownership by the business serves a legitimate business purpose and that titling and registration of the vehicle by the business was not done to circumvent the intent of this section; or\n\n(c) a person participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program as an habitual offender pursuant to Section 56-1-1090(A).\n\n(3) Whenever the person operates the employer's vehicle pursuant to this subsection, the person shall have with the person a copy of the Department of Motor Vehicles' form specified by Section 56-1-400(B).\n\n(4) This subsection will be construed in parallel with the requirements of Section 56-1-400(B). A waiver issued pursuant to this subsection will be subject to the same review and revocation as described in Section 56-1-400(B).\n\n(M) It is unlawful for a person to tamper with or disable, or attempt to tamper with or disable, an ignition interlock device installed on a motor vehicle pursuant to this section. Obstructing or obscuring the camera lens of an ignition interlock device constitutes tampering. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(N) It is unlawful for a person to knowingly rent, lease, or otherwise provide a person who is subject to this section with a motor vehicle without a properly operating, certified ignition interlock device. This subsection does not apply if the person began the lease contract period for the motor vehicle prior to the person's arrest for a first offense violation of Section 56-5-2930 or 56-5-2933 or prior to a person who is participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program as an habitual offender pursuant to Section 56-1-1090(A) receiving his license with an ignition interlock restriction. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(O) It is unlawful for a person who is subject to the provisions of this section to solicit or request another person, or for a person to solicit or request another person on behalf of a person who is subject to the provisions of this section, to engage an ignition interlock device to start a motor vehicle with a device installed pursuant to this section or to conduct a running retest while the vehicle is in operation. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(P) It is unlawful for another person on behalf of a person subject to the provisions of this section to engage an ignition interlock device to start a motor vehicle with a device installed pursuant to this section or to conduct a running retest while that vehicle is in operation. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(Q) Only ignition interlock devices certified by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may be used to fulfill the requirements of this section.\n\n(1) The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall certify whether a device meets the accuracy requirements and specifications provided in guidelines or regulations adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as amended from time to time. Manufacturers of ignition interlock devices shall apply to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services for certification of devices provided to South Carolina drivers who are subject to the ignition interlock restriction. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may charge an initial annual fee on the manufacturer's application for certification of each device, and a subsequent fee for every year the manufacturer continues to provide the certified device to South Carolina drivers. This fee shall be remitted to the Ignition Interlock Device Fund for use by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services in support of the Ignition Interlock Device Program.\n\n(2) All devices certified to be used in South Carolina must be set to prohibit the starting of a motor vehicle when an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more is measured and all running retests must record violations of an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more, and must capture a photographic image of the driver as the driver is operating the ignition interlock device. The photographic images recorded by the ignition interlock device may be used by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services to aid in the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' management of the Ignition Interlock Device Program; however, neither the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' employees, nor any other political subdivision of this State may be held liable for any injury caused by a driver or other person who operates a motor vehicle after the use or attempted use of an ignition interlock device.\n\n(3) The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall maintain a current list of certified ignition interlock devices and manufacturers. The list must be updated at least quarterly. If a particular certified device fails to continue to meet federal requirements, the device must be decertified, may not be used until it is compliant with federal requirements, and must be replaced with a device that meets federal requirements. The cost for removal and replacement must be borne by the manufacturer of the noncertified device.\n\n(4) Only ignition interlock installers certified by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may install and service ignition interlock devices required pursuant to this section. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall maintain a current list of vendors that are certified to install the devices.\n\n(R) In addition to availability under the Freedom of Information Act, any Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' policy concerning ignition interlock devices must be made publicly accessible on the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' internet website. The information regarding a person's participation in the Ignition Interlock Device Program recorded by the ignition interlock device is collected at the direction of the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services and is a record of the department. Information obtained by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services and ignition interlock service providers regarding a person's participation in the Ignition Interlock Device Program is to be used for internal purposes only and is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. A person participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program or the person's family member may request that the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services provide the person or family member with information obtained by the department and ignition interlock service providers. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may release the information to the person or family member at the department's discretion. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services and ignition interlock service providers must purge all photographic images collected by the device no later than twelve months from the date of the person's completion of the Ignition Interlock Device Program. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services may retain the images past twelve months if there are any pending appeals or contested case hearings involved with that person, and at their conclusion must purge the images. The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services and ignition interlock service providers must purge all personal information regarding a person's participation in the Ignition Interlock Device Program no later than twelve months from the date of the person's completion of the Ignition Interlock Device Program except for that information which is relevant for pending legal matters.\n\n(S) The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services shall develop policies including, but not limited to, the certification, use, maintenance, and operation of ignition interlock devices and the Ignition Interlock Device Fund.\n\n(T) This section shall apply retroactively to any person currently serving a suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit due to a suspension listed in subsection (A).\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 390, Section 12; 2007 Act No. 103, Section 23.A, eff January 1, 2008; 2008 Act No. 285, Section 1, eff January 1, 2009; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 9, eff October 1, 2014; 2015 Act No. 34 (S.590), Section 3, eff June 1, 2015; 2017 Act No. 89 (H.3247), Section 34, eff November 19, 2018; 2023 Act No. 55 (S.36), Section 7, eff May 19, 2023 and May 19, 2024.",

A breath test must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer who has arrested a person for driving a motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs. At the direction of the arresting officer, the person first must be offered a breath test to determine the person's alcohol concentration. If the person is physically unable to provide an acceptable breath sample because the person has an injured mouth, is unconscious or dead, or for any other reason considered acceptable by the licensed medical personnel, the arresting officer may request a blood sample to be taken. If the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is under the influence of drugs other than alcohol, or is under the influence of a combination of alcohol and drugs, the officer may order that a urine sample be taken for testing. A breath sample taken for testing must be collected within two hours of the arrest. Any additional tests to collect other samples must be collected within three hours of the arrest. The breath test must be administered by a person trained and certified by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, pursuant to SLED policies. Before the breath test is administered, an eight one-hundredths of one percent simulator test must be performed and the result must reflect a reading between 0.076 percent and 0.084 percent. Blood and urine samples must be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, and other medical personnel trained to obtain the samples in a licensed medical facility. Blood and urine samples must be obtained and handled in accordance with procedures approved by SLED.\n\n(B) No tests may be administered or samples obtained unless, upon activation of the video recording equipment and prior to the commencement of the testing procedure, the person has been given a written copy of and verbally informed that:\n\n(1) the person does not have to take the test or give the samples, but that the person's privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least six months with the option of ending the suspension if the person enrolls in the Ignition Interlock Device Program, if the person refuses to submit to the test, and that the person's refusal may be used against the person in court;\n\n(2) the person's privilege to drive must be suspended for at least one month with the option of ending the suspension if the person enrolls in the Ignition Interlock Device Program, if the person takes the test or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(3) the person has the right to have a qualified person of the person's own choosing conduct additional independent tests at the person's expense;\n\n(4) the person has the right to request a contested case hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and\n\n(5) if the person does not request a contested case hearing or if the person's suspension is upheld at the contested case hearing, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\n\n(C) A hospital, physician, qualified technician, chemist, or registered nurse who obtains the samples or conducts the test or participates in the process of obtaining the samples or conducting the test in accordance with this section is not subject to a cause of action for assault, battery, or another cause alleging that the drawing of blood or taking samples at the request of the arrested person or a law enforcement officer was wrongful. This release from liability does not reduce the standard of medical care required of the person obtaining the samples or conducting the test. This qualified release also applies to the employer of the person who conducts the test or obtains the samples.\n\n(D) The person tested or giving samples for testing may have a qualified person of the person's own choosing conduct additional tests at the person's expense and must be notified in writing of that right. A person's request or failure to request additional blood or urine tests is not admissible against the person in the criminal trial. The failure or inability of the person tested to obtain additional tests does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the tests or samples obtained at the direction of the law enforcement officer.\n\n(E) The arresting officer shall provide affirmative assistance to the person to contact a qualified person to conduct and obtain additional tests. Affirmative assistance, at a minimum, includes providing transportation for the person to the nearest medical facility which performs blood tests to determine a person's alcohol concentration. If the medical facility obtains the blood sample but refuses or fails to test the blood sample to determine the person's alcohol concentration, SLED shall test the blood sample and provide the result to the person and to the arresting officer. Failure to provide affirmative assistance upon request to obtain additional tests bars the admissibility of the breath test result in a judicial or administrative proceeding.\n\nSLED shall administer the provisions of this subsection and shall make regulations necessary to carry out this subsection's provisions. The costs of the tests administered at the direction of the law enforcement officer must be paid from the state's general fund. However, if the person is subsequently convicted of violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945, then, upon conviction, the person shall pay twenty-five dollars for the costs of the tests. The twenty-five dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the State Law Enforcement Division to offset the costs of administration of the breath testing devices, breath testing site video program, and toxicology laboratory.\n\n(F) A qualified person who obtains samples or administers the tests or assists in obtaining samples or the administration of tests at the direction of a law enforcement officer is released from civil and criminal liability unless the obtaining of samples or tests is performed in a negligent, reckless, or fraudulent manner. No person may be required by the arresting officer, or by another law enforcement officer, to obtain or take any sample of blood or urine.\n\n(G) In the criminal prosecution for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 the alcohol concentration at the time of the test, as shown by chemical analysis of the person's breath or other body fluids, gives rise to the following:\n\n(1) if the alcohol concentration was at that time five one-hundredths of one percent or less, it is conclusively presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;\n\n(2) if the alcohol concentration was at that time in excess of five one-hundredths of one percent but less than eight one-hundredths of one percent, this fact does not give rise to any inference that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but this fact may be considered with other evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the person; or\n\n(3) if the alcohol concentration was at that time eight one-hundredths of one percent or more, it may be inferred that the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe provisions of this section must not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the person was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs.\n\n(H) A person who is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of refusal is considered to be informed and not to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (A) of this section.\n\n(I) A person required to submit to tests by the arresting law enforcement officer must be provided with a written report including the time of arrest, the time of the tests, and the results of the tests before any trial or other proceeding in which the results of the tests are used as evidence. A person who obtains additional tests shall furnish a copy of the time, method, and results of such tests to the officer before a trial, hearing, or other proceeding in which the person attempts to use the results of the additional tests as evidence.\n\n(J) Policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by SLED may be reviewed by the trial judge or hearing officer on motion of either party. The failure to follow policies, procedures, and regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the exclusion from evidence of any test results, if the trial judge or hearing officer finds that this failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability of the test results or the fairness of the testing procedure and the court trial judge or hearing officer rules specifically as to the manner in which the failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability of the test results or the fairness of the procedure.\n\n(K) If a state employee charged with the maintenance of breath testing devices in this State and the administration of breath testing policy is required to testify at a contested case hearing or court proceeding, the entity employing the witness may charge a reasonable fee to the defendant for such services.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-344; 1952 Code Section 46-344; 1949 (46) 466; 1969 (56) 395; 1987 Act No. 95 Section 9; 1987 Act No. 179 Section 2; 1988 Act No. 348; 1988 Act No. 616; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1420; 1994 Act No. 497, Part II, Section 36T; 1998 Act No. 434, Section 7; 2000 Act No. 390, Section 14; 2003 Act No. 61, Section 6; 2008 Act No. 201, Section 9, eff February 10, 2009; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 13, eff October 1, 2014.",

The arresting officer shall issue a notice of suspension which is effective beginning on the date of the alleged violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945.\n\n(B)(1) Within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension, the person may:\n\n(a) request a contested case hearing before the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings pursuant to its rules of procedure; and, either:\n\n(b) enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941; or\n\n(c) obtain a temporary alcohol license from the Department of Motor Vehicles. A one hundred dollar fee must be assessed for obtaining a temporary alcohol license and such fee must be held in trust by the Department of Motor Vehicles until final disposition of any contested case hearing. Should the temporary suspension provided for in this subsection be upheld during the contested case hearing, twenty-five dollars of the fee must be distributed by the Department of Motor Vehicles to the Department of Public Safety for supplying and maintaining all necessary vehicle videotaping equipment, while the remaining seventy-five dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into the State Highway Fund as established by Section 57-11-20, to be distributed as provided in Section 11-43-167. The temporary alcohol license allows the person to drive without any restrictive conditions pending the outcome of the contested case hearing provided for in subsection (F), this section, or the final decision or disposition of the matter. If the suspension is upheld at the contested case hearing, the temporary alcohol license remains in effect until the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings issues the hearing officer's decision and the Department of Motor Vehicles sends notice to the person pursuant to subsection (H).\n\n(2) At the contested case hearing, if:\n\n(a) the suspension is upheld, the person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be suspended or the person must be denied the issuance of a license or permit for the remainder of the suspension period provided for in subsection (I). Within thirty days of the issuance of the notice that the suspension has been upheld, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2990 and must enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941;\n\n(b) the suspension is overturned, the person must have the person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege reinstated and the person must be reimbursed by the Department of Motor Vehicles in the amount of the fees provided for in subsection (B)(1)(c).\n\n(3) If the suspension is overturned, the person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be reinstated.\n\n(4) The provisions of this subsection do not affect the trial for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945.\n\n(C) The period of suspension provided for in subsection (I) begins on the day the notice of suspension is issued, or at the expiration of any other suspensions, and continues until the person applies for a temporary alcohol license and requests a contested case hearing.\n\n(D) If a person does not request a contested case hearing, the person waives the person's right to the hearing, and the person's suspension must not be stayed but continues for the period provided for in subsection (I).\n\n(E) The notice of suspension must advise the person:\n\n(1) of the person's right to obtain a temporary alcohol driver's license and to request a contested case hearing before the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings;\n\n(2) that, if the person does not request a contested case hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension, the person waives the person's right to the contested case hearing, and the suspension continues for the period provided for in subsection (I); and\n\n(3) that, if the suspension is upheld at the contested case hearing or the person does not request a contested case hearing, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\n\n(F)(1) A contested case hearing must be held after the request for the hearing is received by the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings. The scope of the hearing is limited to whether the person:\n\n(a) was lawfully arrested or detained;\n\n(b) was given a written copy of and verbally informed of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-2950;\n\n(c) refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; or\n\n(d) consented to taking a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, and the:\n\n(i) reported alcohol concentration at the time of testing was fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(ii) individual who administered the test or took samples was qualified pursuant to Section 56-5-2950;\n\n(iii) tests administered and samples obtained were conducted pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; and\n\n(iv) machine was working properly.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section prohibits the introduction of evidence at the contested case hearing on the issue of the accuracy of the breath test result.\n\n(3) A written order must be issued to all parties either reversing or upholding the suspension of the person's license, permit, or nonresident's operating privilege, or denying the issuance of a license or permit. If the suspension is upheld, the person must receive credit for the number of days the person's license was suspended before the person received a temporary alcohol license and requested the contested case hearing and must receive credit for the number of days, if any, the person maintained an ignition interlock restriction on the temporary alcohol license.\n\n(4) The Department of Motor Vehicles and the arresting officer shall have the burden of proof in contested case hearings conducted pursuant to this section. If neither the Department of Motor Vehicles nor the arresting officer appears at the contested case hearing, the hearing officer shall rescind the suspension of the person's license, permit, or nonresident's operating privilege regardless of whether the person requesting the contested case hearing or the person's attorney appears at the contested case hearing.\n\n(G) A contested case hearing is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, and a person has a right to appeal the decision of the hearing officer pursuant to that act to the Administrative Law Court in accordance with the Administrative Law Court's appellate rules. The filing of an appeal stays the suspension until a final decision is issued on appeal.\n\n(H) If the person did not request a contested case hearing or the suspension is upheld at the contested case hearing, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2990.\n\n(I)(1) Except as provided in item (3), the period of a driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege suspension for, or denial of issuance of a license or permit to, an arrested person who has no previous convictions for violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs within the ten years preceding a violation of this section, and who has had no previous suspension imposed pursuant to Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2951, or 56-5-2990, within the ten years preceding a violation of this section is:\n\n(a) six months for a person who refuses to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; or\n\n(b) one month for a person who takes a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more.\n\n(2) The period of a driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege suspension for, or denial of issuance of a license or permit to, a person who has been convicted previously for violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945, or another law of this State or another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or another drug within the ten years preceding a violation of this section, or who has had a previous suspension imposed pursuant to Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2951, or 56-5-2990, within the ten years preceding a violation of this section is:\n\n(a) for a second offense, nine months if the person refuses to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, or two months if the person takes a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(b) for a third offense, twelve months if the person refuses to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, or three months if the person takes a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more; and\n\n(c) for a fourth or subsequent offense, fifteen months if the person refuses to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, or four months if the person takes a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more.\n\n(3)(a) In lieu of serving the remainder of a suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit, a person may enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle equal to the length of time remaining on the person's suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit. If the length of time remaining is less than three months, the ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for three months.\n\n(b) The person must receive credit for the number of days the person maintained an ignition interlock restriction on the temporary alcohol license.\n\n(c) Once a person has enrolled in the Ignition Interlock Device Program and obtained an ignition interlock restricted license, the person is subject to Section 56-5-2941 and cannot subsequently choose to serve the suspension.\n\n(J) A person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be restored when the person's period of suspension or ignition interlock restricted license requirement pursuant to subsection (I) has concluded, even if the person has not yet completed the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. After the person's driving privilege is restored, the person shall continue the services of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. If the person withdraws from or in any way stops making satisfactory progress toward the completion of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, the person's license must be suspended until the completion of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. A person shall be attending or have completed an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2990 before the person's driving privilege can be restored at the conclusion of the suspension period or ignition interlock restricted license requirement.\n\n(K) When a nonresident's privilege to drive a motor vehicle in this State has been suspended pursuant to the provisions of this section, the department shall give written notice of the action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person's residence and of any state in which the person has a license or permit.\n\n(L) The department shall not suspend the privilege to drive of a person under the age of twenty-one pursuant to Section 56-1-286, if the person's privilege to drive has been suspended pursuant to this section arising from the same incident.\n\n(M) A person whose driver's license or permit is suspended pursuant to this section is not required to file proof of financial responsibility.\n\n(N) An insurer shall not increase premiums on, add surcharges to, or cancel the automobile insurance of a person charged with a violation of Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs based solely on the violation unless the person is convicted of the violation.\n\n(O) The department shall administer the provisions of this section.\n\n(P) Nothing in this section shall prevent the prosecuting authority from waiving or dismissing the charge.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 434, Section 8; 1999 Act No. 115, Sections 7, 8, 13; 1999 Act No. 100, Part II, Section 11; 1999 Act No. 115, Section 15; 2000 Act No. 390, Sections 15 to 22; 2001 Act No. 79, Sections 2.I.1. and 2.I.2.; 2002 Act No. 296, Sections 2, 3; 2002 Act No. 348, Sections 10 and 11; 2002 Act No. 354, Sections 4 and 5; 2003 Act No. 61, Section 7; 2006 Act No. 381, Section 7, eff June 13, 2006; 2008 Act No. 201, Section 10, eff February 10, 2009; 2012 Act No. 212, Section 4, eff June 7, 2012; 2012 Act No. 264, Section 5, eff June 18, 2012; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 14, eff October 1, 2014; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Sections 75, 76, eff July 1, 2016; 2023 Act No. 55 (S.36), Section 8, eff May 19, 2024; 2024 Act No. 130 (H.3518), Section 2, eff May 19, 2024.",

In circumstances including, but not limited to, road blocks, traffic accident investigations, and citizens' arrests, where an arrest has been made and the video recording equipment has not been activated by blue lights, the failure by the arresting officer to produce the video recordings required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal. However, as soon as video recording is practicable in these circumstances, video recording must begin and conform with the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to produce the video recording based upon the totality of the circumstances; nor do the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering evidence relating to the arresting law enforcement officer's failure to produce the video recording.\n\n(C) A video recording must not be disposed of in any manner except for its transfer to a master recording for consolidation purposes until the results of any legal proceeding in which it may be involved are finally determined.\n\n(D) SLED is responsible for purchasing, maintaining, and supplying all necessary video recording equipment for use at the breath test sites. SLED also is responsible for monitoring all breath test sites to ensure the proper maintenance of video recording equipment. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for purchasing, maintaining, and supplying all videotaping equipment for use in all law enforcement vehicles used for traffic enforcement. The Department of Public Safety also is responsible for monitoring all law enforcement vehicles used for traffic enforcement to ensure proper maintenance of video recording equipment.\n\n(E) Beginning one month from the effective date of this section, all of the funds received in accordance with Section 14-1-208(C)(9) must be expended by SLED to equip all breath test sites with video recording devices and supplies.

The remaining twelve and one-half percent of the funds received in accordance with Section 14-1-208(C)(9) must be expended by SLED to purchase, maintain, and supply video recording equipment for the breath test sites. Funds must be distributed by the State Treasurer to the Department of Public Safety and SLED on a monthly basis. The Department of Public Safety and SLED are authorized to carry forward any unexpended funds received in accordance with Section 14-1-208(C)(9) as of June thirtieth of each year and to expend these carried forward funds for the purchase, maintenance, and supply of video recording equipment.

The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for six months. The person is not eligible for a provisional license pursuant to Article 7, Chapter 1, Title 56.\n\n(3) For a second offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for two years.\n\n(4) For a third offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for three years. If the third offense occurs within five years from the date of the first offense, the ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for four years.\n\n(5) For a fourth or subsequent offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for life.\n\n(6) Except as provided in subsection (A)(4), only those offenses which occurred within ten years, including and immediately preceding the date of the last offense, shall constitute prior offenses within the meaning of this section.\n\n(B) A person whose license is suspended pursuant to this section, Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2945, or 56-5-2951 must be notified by the department of the suspension and of the requirement to enroll in and successfully complete an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program certified by the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. An assessment of the extent and nature of the alcohol and drug abuse problem, if any, of the person must be prepared and a plan of education or treatment, or both, must be developed for the person. Entry into the services, if the services are necessary, recommended in the plan of education or treatment, or both, developed for the person is a mandatory requirement of the issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license to the person whose license is suspended pursuant to this section. Successful completion of the services, if the services are necessary, recommended in the plan of education or treatment, or both, developed for the person is a mandatory requirement of the full restoration of driving privileges to the person whose license is suspended pursuant to this section. The Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program shall determine if the person has successfully completed the services. Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Programs shall meet at least once a month. The person whose license is suspended shall attend the first Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program available after the date of enrollment.\n\n(C) The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services shall determine the cost of services provided by each certified Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. Each person shall bear the cost of services recommended in the person's plan of education or treatment. The cost may not exceed five hundred dollars for education services, two thousand dollars for treatment services, and two thousand five hundred dollars in total for all services. No person may be denied services due to an inability to pay. Inability to pay for services may not be used as a factor in determining if the person has successfully completed services. A person who is unable to pay for services shall perform fifty hours of community service as arranged by the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, which may use the completion of this community service as a factor in determining if the person has successfully completed services. The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services shall report annually to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee on the number of first and multiple offenders completing the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, the amount of fees collected and expenses incurred by each Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, and the number of community service hours performed in lieu of payment.\n\n(D) If the person has not successfully completed the services as directed by the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program within one year of enrollment, a hearing must be provided by the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program whose decision is appealable to the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. If the person is unsuccessful in the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, the Department of Motor Vehicles may waive the successful completion of the program as a mandatory requirement of the issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license upon the recommendation of the Medical Advisory Board as utilized by the Department of Motor Vehicles, if the Medical Advisory Board determines public safety and welfare of the person may not be endangered.\n\n(E) The Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services shall develop procedures necessary for the communication of information pertaining to relicensing, or otherwise. These procedures must be consistent with the confidentiality laws of the State and the United States. If a person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to this section, an insurance company shall not refuse to issue insurance to cover the remaining members of the person's family, but the insurance company is not liable for any actions of the person whose license has been suspended or who has voluntarily turned the person's license in to the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-348; 1952 Code Section 46-348; 1949 (46) 466; 1956 (49) 1688; 1958 (50) 1662; 1981 Act No. 167, Section 2; 1982 Act No. 355, Section 4; 1983 Act No. 114 Section 2; 1985 Act No. 201, Part II, Section 39B; 1988 Act No. 532, Section 28; 1988 Act No. 658, Part II, Section 38B; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1421; 1996 Act No; 459, Section 186; 1998 Act No. 258, Section 13; 1998 Act No. 379, Section 1; 1998 Act No. 434, Section 10; 1999 Act No. 100, Part II, Section 11; 1999 Act No. 115, Section 14; 2000 Act No. 390, Sections 27, 28; 2002 Act No. 296, Section 1; 2002 Act No. 348, Section 9; 2002 Act No. 354, Section 3; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 15, eff October 1, 2014; 2015 Act No. 34 (S.590), Section 2, eff June 1, 2015; 2023 Act No. 55 (S.36), Section 9, eff May 19, 2024.",

      "text": "(A) As used in this article, \"Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Device\" or \"EPAMD\" means a self-balancing two nontandem wheeled device designed to transport one person, with an electric propulsion system with average power of seven hundred fifty watts (one horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by this propulsion system while ridden by an operator weighing one hundred seventy pounds, is less than twenty miles an hour.\n\n(B) The operation of an EPAMD is governed by the provisions of this article. Notwithstanding another provision of law, an EPAMD is not considered a \"vehicle\" or \"motor vehicle\" within the meaning of the laws of this State and no provisions of law relating to vehicles or motor vehicles apply to an EPAMD unless specified in this article.\n\n(C) A person may operate an EPAMD upon sidewalks, roadways, bicycle routes, paths, or trails as contained in this article.\n\n(D) A person operating an EPAMD on a sidewalk, roadway, bicycle route, path, or trail shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with, and shall yield the right-of-way to, pedestrians and human powered devices. A person operating an EPAMD also shall give an audible signal before overtaking and passing a pedestrian or person operating a human powered device.\n\n(E) An EPAMD must not be operated at a speed greater than fifteen miles an hour.\n\n(F) A person operating an EPAMD shall obey the instructions of an official traffic control device specifically applicable to him unless otherwise directed by a police officer. A person operating an EPAMD is subject to traffic and pedestrian control signals as provided in Sections 56-5-970 and 56-5-990. At all other places a person operating an EPAMD must be accorded the privileges and is subject to the restrictions contained in this article.\n\n(G) Local authorities by ordinance may require that a person operating an EPAMD strictly comply with the directions of an official traffic control signal and by ordinance may prohibit a person operating an EPAMD from crossing a roadway in a business district or a designated highway except in a crosswalk.\n\n(H) When traffic control signals are not in place or not in operation, the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way, slow down, or stop to yield to a person operating an EPAMD crossing a roadway within a crosswalk when the person operating the EPAMD is upon or approaching the portion of the roadway on which the vehicle is traveling. A person operating an EPAMD shall not leave a curb suddenly, or another place of safety, move into the path of a vehicle and create an immediate hazard. When a vehicle is stopped at a marked crosswalk or at an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection to permit an EPAMD to cross the roadway, the driver of another vehicle approaching from the rear shall not overtake and pass the stopped vehicle.\n\n(I) A person operating an EPAMD shall move, whenever practicable, upon the right portion of a crosswalk.\n\n(J) A person operating an EPAMD while crossing a roadway at a point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway. A person operating an EPAMD crossing a roadway at a point where a pedestrian tunnel or overhead pedestrian crossing has been provided shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway. Between adjacent intersections at which traffic control signals are in operation a person operating an EPAMD shall cross only at an intersection marked crosswalk. A person operating an EPAMD shall not cross a roadway intersection diagonally unless authorized by official traffic control devices. When authorized to cross a roadway diagonally, a person operating an EPAMD shall cross only in accordance with the official traffic control devices pertaining to these crossing movements.\n\n(K) Where a sidewalk is provided and its use is practicable, it is unlawful for a person to operate an EPAMD along and upon an adjacent roadway. Where a sidewalk is not available, a person operating an EPAMD along and upon a highway shall operate only on a shoulder as far as practicable from the edge of the roadway. Where neither a sidewalk nor a shoulder is available, a person operating an EPAMD along and upon a highway shall operate it as near as practicable to an outside edge of the roadway and, if on a two-way roadway, shall operate only on the left side of the roadway. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a person operating an EPAMD upon a roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway.\n\n(L) A person operating an EPAMD, unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement officer, shall not occupy a space within the limits of the roadway and shoulder of the main facility of a freeway, except to perform public works or official duties, resulting from an emergency caused by an accident or breakdown of a motor vehicle, or to obtain assistance. The prohibitions imposed by this subsection on the use of freeways do not apply to service roads alongside the highways. A person who violates the provisions contained in this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one hundred dollars or be imprisoned for not more than thirty days.\n\n(M) Notwithstanding a local ordinance, every driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with a person operating an EPAMD and shall give an audible signal when necessary.\n\n(N) Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle making use of an audible signal meeting the requirements of Section 56-5-4970 and visual signals meeting the requirements of Section 56-5-4700, or of a police vehicle properly and lawfully making use of an audible signal only, a person operating an EPAMD shall yield the right-of-way to the authorized emergency vehicle. This subsection shall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway nor from the duty to exercise due care to avoid colliding with a person operating an EPAMD.\n\n(O) An EPAMD must not be used to carry more persons than it is designed and equipped to carry.\n\n(P) A person operating an EPAMD shall not enter or remain upon a bridge or an approach to it beyond the bridge signal, gate, or barrier after a bridge operation signal indication has been given. A person operating an EPAMD shall not pass through, around, over, or under a crossing gate or a barrier at a railroad grade crossing or bridge while the gate or barrier is closed or is being opened or closed.\n\n(Q) An EPAMD must be equipped with a stopping mechanism which will enable the operator to bring the EPAMD to a controlled stop. A person shall not operate an EPAMD unless it is equipped with a bell or other device capable of giving a signal audible for a distance of at least one hundred feet. However, an EPAMD shall not be equipped with, nor shall a person use, a siren or whistle on an EPAMD, except as provided in subsection (R). An EPAMD when in use at nighttime must be equipped with a lamp on the front which shall emit a white light visible from a distance of at least five hundred feet to the front and with front, rear, and side reflectors which must be visible from at least three hundred feet.\n\n(R) An authorized police patrol EPAMD used as a part of a police EPAMD patrol may exercise the privileges of an emergency vehicle as provided in Section 56-5-760. An authorized police patrol EPAMD may be equipped with a siren. An officer utilizing a police patrol EPAMD may use his whistle or deploy the vehicle's siren for law enforcement purposes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 56-5-760(C), an authorized police patrol EPAMD acting as an emergency vehicle is entitled to the exemptions of an authorized emergency vehicle if it makes use of an audible signal meeting the requirements of Section 56-5-4970 or visual signals meeting the requirements of Section 56-5-4700.\n\n(S) An operator of an EPAMD who violates a provision contained in this article, unless specified in a subsection, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than twenty-five dollars.\n\nHISTORY: 2002 Act No. 269, Section 1.",

The department may register the vehicle for a load capacity which, added to the empty or unloaded weight of the vehicle, will result in a permissible gross weight not exceeding the limitations set forth in this chapter. It is unlawful for a person to operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles with a load capacity in excess of that for which it is registered by the department or in excess of the limitations set forth in this chapter. A person making application for a \"farm truck\" license shall declare in the form prescribed by the department the true unloaded or empty weight of the vehicle and shall stencil or mark in a conspicuous place on the left side of the vehicle the true unloaded or empty weight if the unloaded or empty weight is over five thousand pounds. A \"farm truck\" operating solely in intrastate commerce and otherwise specified in Section 56-5-225 is not required to have the name of the registered owner, lessor, or lessee stenciled or otherwise marked on the vehicle.\n\n(B) A private motor truck or truck tractor equal to or exceeding 26,001 pounds gross weight and a for-hire motor truck or truck tractor must have the name of the registered owner or lessor on the side clearly distinguishable at a distance of fifty feet.

Whenever an officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until the portion of the load necessary to reduce the axle weight, or gross weight of the vehicle, or both, to the limits permitted under this chapter is removed. All material unloaded must be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at his own risk. In determining whether the limits established by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 have been exceeded, the scaled weights of the gross weight of vehicles and combinations of vehicles are considered to be not closer than ten percent to the true gross weight, except as otherwise provided in Section 56-5-4140.\n\n(B) A person who operates a vehicle on a public highway whose axle weight is in excess of the limits imposed by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined five cents per pound or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both. If a vehicle does not exceed the gross weight limits provided for by this article, and the axle weight limits are not exceeded by more than five percent including enforcement tolerances, the fine imposed is reduced by fifty percent with a minimum fine of twenty-five dollars.\n\n(C) A person who operates a vehicle found to exceed the excess gross weight limitations imposed by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall pay to the Department of Public Safety a fine based on the following scale:\n\n(1) 500-3,500 pounds: four cents per pound over weight limit;\n\n(2) 3,501-6000 pounds: six cents per pound over weight limit, beginning with the first pound in excess;\n\n(3) 6,001 pounds and over: ten cents per pound over weight limit, beginning with the first pound in excess.\n\nThe fine imposed pursuant to items (1) and (2) must be equal to one-half the rate for vehicles transporting raw farm or forest products from the farm or forest to the first market, or by fully enclosed motor vehicles designed specifically for collecting, compacting, and hauling garbage from residences or from garbage dumpsters, or by motor vehicles operating open top trailers used for hauling recyclables, scrap, and waste materials from sites without facilities for weighing, when operating for those purposes. If an operator is found to be in violation of both gross and axle limits, only one citation may be issued, the fine being for the greater of the two, for that load. No fine may be issued for violation of the vehicle registration statutes if that vehicle is registered for the maximum allowable weight for that class of vehicle as provided in Section 56-5-4140.\n\nIf the operator of the vehicle, upon conviction, fails to remit the fine imposed by this subsection to the Department of Public Safety, the owner of the vehicle is responsible for remitting the fine. The court is prohibited from suspending any portion of this fine.\n\n(D)(1) A person who operates a vehicle found to have out-of-service violations, other than violations of brakes out of adjustment and lighting violations which can be repaired at the scene, detected during a roadside inspection, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall pay to the Department of Public Safety a fine of two hundred dollars.\n\n(2)(a) An individual who operates a commercial motor vehicle on a public highway whose vehicle or driver is in violation of the out-of-service order as defined in 49 CFR 390.5 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined five hundred dollars.\n\n(b) A company or individual who operates or allows a commercial motor vehicle to be operated on a public highway in violation of a motor carrier operation out-of-service order, or order to cease operation, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined one thousand dollars.\n\n(3) If the operator of the vehicle, upon conviction, fails to remit the fine imposed by this subsection to the Department of Public Safety, the owner of the vehicle is responsible for remitting the fine. The court is prohibited from suspending any portion of this fine.\n\n(E) At the time that a uniform size, weight, and safety citation is issued pursuant to this section, the officer or agent who is authorized to issue the citation must inform the individual receiving the citation that he has the option, at that time, to elect to pay his fine directly to the Department of Public Safety or to receive a hearing in magistrate's court. If the individual at the time the citation is issued elects to pay his fine directly to the department within twenty-eight days, as specified on the citation, no assessments may be added to the original fine pursuant to this section. The fine may be deposited with the arresting officer or a person the department may designate. The fine must be deposited in full or other arrangements satisfactory to the department for payment must be made before the operator is allowed to move the vehicle.\n\n(F) Magistrates have jurisdiction of all contested violations of this section. All monies collected pursuant to Section 56-5-4160 must be forwarded to the Department of Public Safety as provided for in this section. A magistrate, within forty-five days, must forward all monies collected to the department for deposit in the account established in this section. The department shall use these monies to establish and maintain automated data bases, to upgrade and refurbish existing weigh stations, to purchase and maintain portable scales, to hire additional State Transport Police Officers, to purchase equipment for State Transport Police Officers, and to procure other commercial motor vehicle safety measures, and fund other commercial motor vehicle safety programs that the department considers necessary. The fine may be deposited with the arresting officer or a person the department may designate. The fine must be deposited in full or other arrangements satisfactory to the department for payment must be made before the operator is allowed to move the vehicle. If there is no conviction, the fine must be returned to the owner promptly.\n\n\"Conviction\", as used in this section, also includes the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and the forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure a defendant's presence in the court.\n\nIf the fine is not paid in full to the Department of Public Safety within forty-five days after conviction, the license and registration of the vehicle found to violate Section 58-23-1120 or Regulations 38-423 et seq. or exceed the limits imposed by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 must be suspended. The owner of the vehicles immediately shall return the license and registration of the vehicle to the Department of Motor Vehicles. If a person fails to return them as provided in this section, the Department of Motor Vehicles may secure possession of them by a commissioned trooper or officer. The suspension continues until the fine is paid in full.\n\n(G) The Department of Public Safety shall provide a separate uniform citation to be used by the State Transport Police Division of the Department of Public Safety. The uniform citation must be used for all size, weight, idling, and safety violations which the State Transport Police Division of the Department of Public Safety is primarily responsible for enforcing.\n\n(H) The issuance of a uniform citation to the operator of a vehicle for a violation of this section, Section 58-23-1120, or Regulation 38-423, et seq., constitutes notice to the owner of the violation. The uniform citation must include the following language in bold letters to be printed across the bottom of the citation \"THE ISSUANCE OF A UNIFORM CITATION NOTICE TO THE OPERATOR OF A VEHICLE CONSTITUTES NOTICE TO THE OWNER OF A SIZE, WEIGHT, IDLING, OR SAFETY VIOLATION\".\n\n(I) An individual who fails to conduct a safety inspection of a vehicle as required by Part 396 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or fails to have in his possession documentation that an inspection has been performed must be fined one hundred dollars per vehicle operated in violation of this subsection.\n\n(J) Motor carriers, officers, or agents in charge of them, who fail or refuse to permit authorized State Transport Police representatives or employees to examine and inspect their books, records, accounts, and documents, or their plants, property, or facilities, as provided by law and with reasonable notice, are guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day of such failure or refusal constitutes a separate offense and each offense is punishable by a fine of one thousand dollars.\n\n(K) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all fines collected pursuant to this section must be deposited into an account in the Office of the State Treasurer and called the \"Size, Weight, and Safety Revitalization Program Fund for Permanent Improvements\". Monies credited to the fund may only be expended as authorized in item (F) of this section.\n\n(L) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the maximum gross vehicle weight and axle weight limit for a vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with an idle reduction system, as provided for in 23 U.S.C. 127, may be increased by an amount equal to the weight of the system, not to exceed five hundred fifty pounds. Upon request by a law enforcement officer, the vehicle operator must provide proof that the system is fully functional and that the vehicle's gross weight increase allowed pursuant to this section is attributable only to the system.\n\n(M) Any motor vehicle that is fueled primarily by natural gas shall be allowed to exceed the gross, single axle, tandem axle, or bridge formula weight limits, including tolerances, by no more than two thousand pounds each individually weighed, up to a maximum gross vehicle weight of eighty-two thousand pounds on the interstate, by an amount that is equal to the difference between: the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by that vehicle; and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system. To be eligible for this exception, the operator of the vehicle must be able to demonstrate that the vehicle is a natural gas vehicle, a biofuel vehicle using natural gas, or a vehicle that has been converted to a natural gas vehicle. The operator shall provide documentation which certifies the difference between: the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by that vehicle; and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-666; 1952 Code Section 46-666; 1949 (46) 466; 1980 Act No. 500 Section 3; 1989 Act No. 167, Section 4; 1990 Act No. 612, Part II, Section 48; 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 20A; 1993 Act No. 181, Sections 1436, 1437; 1996 Act No. 459, Section 194; 2006 Act No. 381, Section 12, eff 90 days after approval by the governor (approved June 13, 2006); 2008 Act No. 234, Sections 2, 7, eff upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on May 22, 2008); 2016 Act No. 188 (H.4932), Sections 4, 5, eff May 25, 2016.",

A motor carrier shall not certify or guarantee to a person tendering or interchanging a vehicle to a motor carrier that the vehicle complies with the FMCSR unless the tenderer of the vehicle provides the motor carrier operator with certification that the vehicle meets FMCSR requirements. Before an operator may accept a vehicle, the tenderer must allow the motor carrier operator adequate equipment, time, and facilities to conduct a walk-around pre-trip inspection of the vehicle. If the vehicle fails to meet federal safety requirements, the tenderer immediately must make any necessary repairs to the vehicle so that it complies with applicable safety standards or immediately make available a replacement vehicle which meets the safety requirements.\n\n(C) The Department of Public Safety State Transport Police, if requested by the State Ports Authority, may as a public safety service, enter upon, and perform courtesy inspections of vehicles for purposes of identifying and tagging vehicles which may require mechanical work before being tendered for use on public highways.\n\n(D) If a vehicle that is tendered is placed out of service as a result of a roadside inspection within five complete working days from the time the motor carrier is tendered, the vehicle as indicated on the equipment interchange agreement, then the operator must be reimbursed for all fines and penalties incurred pursuant to the out-of-service order, including reimbursement for all equipment repair expenses necessary to bring the vehicle into compliance with FMCSR, unless the fines, penalties, or repair expenses are due to actions or omissions of the motor carrier operator after the vehicle was tendered. Reimbursement must be made to the operator no later than thirty days after the date of conviction and must include payment for the following equipment repairs:\n\n(1) Brake Adjustments:\n\npush rod travel exceeds limits.\n\n(2) Brake Drum:\n\n(a) drum cracks;\n\n(b) lining thickness loose or missing;\n\n(c) lining saturated with oil.\n\n(3) Inoperative Brakes:\n\n(a) no movement of any components;\n\n(b) missing or broken (loose) components;\n\n(c) mismatch components.\n\n(4) Air Lines and Tubing:\n\n(a) bulge and swelling;\n\n(b) audible leak other than proper connection;\n\n(c) air lines broken, cracked, or crimped.\n\n(5) Reservoir Tank:\n\nany separation of original attachment points.\n\n(6) Frames:\n\n(a) any cracked, loose, sagging, or broken frame members which measured one and one-half inch in web or one inch or longer in bottom flange or any crack extending from web radius into bottom flange;\n\n(b) any condition which causes moving parts to come in contact with the frame.\n\n(7) Electrical.\n\n(8) Wheel Assembly:\n\n(a) low or no oil;\n\n(b) oil leakage on brake components.\n\n(9) Tire Separation:\n\n(a) tire separation from casing;\n\n(b) two inches of plies exposed.\n\n(10) Rim Cracks:\n\n(a) any circumferential crack except manufactured;\n\n(b) lock or side ring cracked, bent, broken, sprung, improperly seated, or mismatched.\n\n(11) Suspension:\n\n(a) spring assembly leaves broken, missing, or separated;\n\n(b) spring hanger, u-bolts, or axle positioning components cracked, broken, loose, or missing.\n\n(12) Chassis Locking Pins:\n\nany twist lock or fitting for securement which is sprung, broken, or improperly latched.\n\n(E) If the originating motor carrier interchanges the vehicle to another mode of transportation or warehouse in substantially the same condition as it was tendered originally to the motor carrier, the originating motor carrier is relieved of any further responsibility for the condition of the vehicle.\n\n(F) The Department of Public Safety shall develop and maintain a separate database on roadside vehicle inspection reports for power unit defects and for defects on any vehicle tendered to the motor carrier. The database may be used to identify and monitor those entities whose responsibility it is to provide any vehicle to motor carriers in roadworthy conditions as prescribed by the FMCSR. Roadside vehicle inspection reports noting defects on any vehicle where there is not ownership by the motor carrier must not be used or applied against the motor carrier when this information may affect the motor carrier's overall record of compliance with the FMCSR.\n\n(G) Nothing in this section prevents a tenderer who is a railroad or a rail intermodal carrier and a motor carrier operator from agreeing to a different allocation of responsibility for compliance of a vehicle with the requirements of this section when the vehicle is owned or has been in the possession of or under the control of a railroad or rail intermodal carrier.

The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver's muscular effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power provided that failure of the service brake actuation system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking brakes shall be so designed that when once applied they shall remain applied with the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brake drums, brake shoes and lining assemblies, brake shoe anchors and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that failure of any one part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes.\n\n(c) Every vehicle, manufactured or assembled after June 7, 1949, shall be equipped with brakes acting on all wheels except:\n\n(1) Trailers, semitrailers or pole trailers, of a gross weight not exceeding three thousand pounds, provided that:\n\n(a) The total weight on and including the wheels of the trailer shall not exceed forty per cent of the gross weight of the towing vehicle when connected to the trailer, and\n\n(b) The combination of vehicles, consisting of the towing vehicle and its total towed load, is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 56-5-4860.\n\n(2) Any vehicle being towed in driveaway or towaway operations, provided the combination of vehicles is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 56-5-4860.\n\n(3) Trucks and truck-tractors having three or more axles need not have brakes on the front wheels, except that when such vehicles are equipped with at least two steerable axles, the wheels of one steerable axle need not have brakes. However, such trucks and truck-tractors must be capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 56-5-4860.\n\n(4) Special mobile equipment.\n\n(5) The wheel of a sidecar attached to a motorcycle or to a motor-driven cycle, or the front wheel of a motor-driven cycle need not be equipped with brakes, provided that such motorcycle or motor-driven cycle is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 56-5-4860.\n\n(d) Every trailer, semitrailer and pole trailer, equipped with air or vacuum actuated brakes and every trailer, semitrailer and pole trailer, with a gross weight in excess of three thousand pounds, shall be equipped with brakes acting on all wheels and of such character as to be applied automatically and promptly, and remain applied for at least fifteen minutes, upon breakaway from the towing vehicle.\n\n(e) Every motor vehicle, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964 and used to tow a trailer, semitrailer or pole trailer equipped with brakes, shall be equipped with means for providing that in case of breakaway of the towed vehicle, the towing vehicle will be capable of being stopped by the use of its service brakes.\n\n(f) Air brakes systems, installed on trailers manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, shall be so designed that the supply reservoir used to provide air for the brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air from the reservoir through the supply line.\n\n(g)(1) Every towing vehicle, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, when used to tow another vehicle equipped with air controlled brakes, in other than driveaway or towaway operations, shall be equipped with two means for emergency application of the trailer brakes. One of these means shall apply the brakes automatically in the event of a reduction of the towing vehicle air supply to a fixed pressure which shall be not lower than twenty pounds per square inch nor higher than forty-five pounds per square inch. The other means shall be a manually controlled device for applying and releasing the brakes, readily operable by a person seated in the driving seat, and its emergency position or method of operation shall be clearly indicated. In no instance may the manual means be so arranged as to permit its use to prevent operation of the automatic means. The automatic and the manual means required by this section may be, but are not required to be, separate.\n\n(2) Every towing vehicle, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, used to tow other vehicles equipped with vacuum brakes, in operations other than driveaway or towaway operations, shall have, in addition to the single control device required by item (h), a second control device which can be used to operate the brakes on towed vehicles in emergencies. The second control shall be independent of brake air, hydraulic and other pressure, and independent of other controls, unless the braking system be so arranged that failure of the pressure upon which the second control depends will cause the towed vehicle brakes to be applied automatically. The second control is not required to provide modulated braking.\n\n(h) Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer and pole trailer, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, and every combination of such vehicles, except motorcycles and motor-driven cycles equipped with brakes, shall have the braking system so arranged that one control device can be used to operate all service brakes. Trailers, equipped with special automatic braking systems actuated by forward pressure on the towing hitch when the towing vehicle is braked, shall be considered as satisfying this requirement, provided the performance capabilities of the trailer brake system meet the requirements of Section 56-5-4860. This requirement does not prohibit vehicles from being equipped with an additional control device to be used to operate brakes on the towed vehicles. This regulation does not apply to driveaway or towaway operations unless the brakes on the individual vehicles are designed to be operated by a single control on the towing vehicle.\n\n(i)(1) Every bus, truck or truck-tractor with air operated brakes shall be equipped with at least one reservoir sufficient to insure that, when fully charged to the maximum pressure as regulated by the air compressor governor cut-out setting, a full service brake application may be made without lowering such reservoir pressure by more than twenty per cent. Each reservoir shall be provided with means for readily draining accumulated oil or water.\n\n(2) Every truck with three or more axles equipped with vacuum assistor type brakes, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, and every truck-tractor and truck, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum brakes, shall be equipped with a reserve capacity or a vacuum reservoir sufficient to insure that, with the reserve capacity or reservoir fully charged and with the engine stopped, a full service brake application may be made without depleting the vacuum supply by more than forty per cent.\n\n(3) All motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers and pole trailers, when equipped with air or vacuum reservoirs or reserve capacity as required by this section, shall have such reservoirs or reserve capacity so safeguarded by a check valve or equivalent device that in the event of failure or leakage in its connection to the source of compressed air or vacuum, the stored air or vacuum shall not be depleted by the leak or failure.\n\n(j)(1) Every bus, truck or truck-tractor, using compressed air for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on any towed vehicle, shall be provided with a warning signal, other than a pressure gauge, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the air reservoir pressure of the vehicle is below fifty per cent of the air compressor governer cut-out pressure. In addition, each such vehicle shall be equipped with a pressure gauge visible to the driver, which indicates in pounds per square inch the pressure available for braking.\n\n(2) Every motor vehicle, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, and used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum operated brakes and every truck, manufactured or assembled after July 1, 1964, with three or more axles using vacuum in the operation of its brakes, except those in driveaway or towaway operations, shall be equipped with a warning signal, other than a gauge indicating vacuum, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the vacuum in the vehicle's supply reservoir or reserve capacity is less than eight inches of mercury.\n\n(3) When a vehicle required to be equipped with a warning device is equipped with both air and vacuum power for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on a towed vehicle, the warning devices may be, but are not required to be, combined into a single device which will serve both purposes. A gauge indicating pressure or vacuum shall not be deemed to be an adequate means of satisfying this requirement.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-561; 1952 Code Section 46-561; 1949 (46) 466; 1964 (53) 2127.",

Notification of the owner and all lienholders by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or certified mail with electronic tracking constitutes notification for purposes of this section. This notification must satisfy the notification requirements contained in Section 29-15-10.

      "text": "(A) Notwithstanding another provision of law, a law enforcement officer who directs that a vehicle be towed for any reason, whether on public or private property, must use the established towing procedure for his jurisdiction. A request by a law enforcement officer resulting from a law enforcement action including, but not limited to, a vehicle collision, vehicle breakdown, or vehicle recovery incident to an arrest, is considered a law enforcement towing for purposes of recovering costs associated with the towing and storage of the vehicle unless the request for towing is made by a law enforcement officer at the direct request of the owner or operator of the vehicle.\n\n(B) Within ten days following a law enforcement's towing request, the proprietor, owner, or operator of any towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must provide to the sheriff or chief of police a list describing the vehicles remaining in the possession of the proprietor, owner, or operator of any towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop. Within ten days of receipt of this list, the sheriff or chief of police must provide to the towing company or storage facility, the current owner's name, address, and a record of all lienholders along with the make, model, and identification number or a description of the vehicle at no cost to the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop. The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop having towed or received the vehicle must notify by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or certified mail with electronic tracking the last known registered owner and all lienholders of record that the vehicle has been taken into custody, pursuant to Section 29-15-10.\n\n(C) If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined, or if the registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all lienholders, the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must provide notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area from which the vehicle was abandoned which is sufficient to meet all requirements of notice pursuant to this article. The notice by publication may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles.\n\n(D)(1) Before a vehicle is sold, the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must apply to the appropriate titling facility for the name and address of any owner or lienholder. The appropriate titling facility may include, but is not limited to:\n\n(a) the Department of Motor Vehicles;\n\n(b) a vendor authorized by the DMV to provide real-time access to title and lienholder information;\n\n(c) if the vehicle is not titled in South Carolina, the titling governmental entity in the state in which the vehicle was last titled as provided by a search of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS);\n\n(d) if the vehicle is not titled in South Carolina, a vendor authorized by the state in which the vehicle was last titled to provide real-time access to the most current title and lienholder information; or\n\n(e) the Department of Natural Resources.\n\n(2) For nontitled vehicles, where the owner's name is known, a search must be conducted through the Secretary of State's Office to determine any lienholders. The application must be on prescribed forms as required by the appropriate titling facility or the Secretary of State. If the vehicle has an out-of-state registration, an application must be made to that state's appropriate titling facility. When the vehicle is not titled in this State and does not have a registration from another state, the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop may apply to the sheriff or chief of police in the jurisdiction where the vehicle is stored to determine the state where the vehicle is registered. The sheriff or chief of police shall conduct a records search. This search must include, but is not limited to, a search on the National Crime Information Center and any other appropriate search that may be conducted with the vehicle's identification number. The sheriff or chief of police must supply, at no cost to the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop, the name of the state in which the vehicle is titled.\n\n(E) The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop that has towed and stored a vehicle has a lien against the vehicle and may have the vehicle sold at public auction pursuant to Section 29-15-10. The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop may hold the license tag of any vehicle until all towing and the storage costs have been paid, or if the vehicle is not reclaimed, until it is declared abandoned and sold.\n\n(F) After the vehicle is in the possession of the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop, the owner of the vehicle as demonstrated by providing a certificate of registration has one opportunity to remove from the vehicle any personal property not attached to the vehicle. The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must release any personal property that does not belong to the owner of the vehicle to the owner of the personal property.\n\n(G) When a law enforcement agency stores a vehicle at a law enforcement facility, the agency must follow the notification procedures contained in this section and submit vehicle information to a magistrate in the county where the vehicle is stored to provide for the sale of the vehicle at public auction. A law enforcement agency is exempt from paying filing fees in any matter related to the towing and storing of a vehicle.\n\nHISTORY: 2003 Act No. 71, Section 1; 2004 Act No. 269, Section 4; 2022 Act No. 233 (H.3729), Section 4, eff June 17, 2022.",

If the demolisher or secondary metals recycler has a photo or copy of the person or entity's agent's identification on file, the demolisher or secondary metals recycler may reference the identification on file without making a photocopy for each transaction;\n\n(e) the date when the purchases or receipts occurred;\n\n(f) the year, make, model, and identification number of the vehicle or vehicle parts, as applicable and if ascertainable, along with any other identifying features; and\n\n(g) a copy of the title certificate, magistrate's order of sale, sheriff's disposal authority certificate, or an original form affidavit, as applicable.\n\n(2) The records must be kept open for inspection by any law enforcement officer at any time during normal business hours. All vehicles on the demolisher or secondary metals recycler's property or otherwise in the possession of the demolisher or secondary metals recycler must be available for inspection by any law enforcement officer at any time during normal business hours.\n\n(3) Records required by this section must be kept by the demolisher or secondary metals recycler for at least one year after the transaction to which it applies. A demolisher or secondary metals recycler may maintain records in an electronic database provided that the information is legible and can be accessed by law enforcement upon request.\n\n(H)(1) A person who violates the provisions of this section for a first offense is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars for each offense not to exceed five thousand dollars for the same set of transactions or occurrences, or imprisoned for not more than sixty days, or both. Each violation constitutes a separate offense. For a second or subsequent offense, the person is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one thousand dollars for each offense not to exceed ten thousand dollars for the same set of transactions or occurrences, or imprisoned for not more than three years, or both. Each violation constitutes a separate offense.\n\n(2) A person who falsifies any information on an application, form, or affidavit required by this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned for not less than one year nor more than three years, or both.\n\n(3) In lieu of criminal penalties, the Department of Motor Vehicles' director, or the director's designee, may issue an administrative fine not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation, whenever the director, or the director's designee, after a hearing, determines that a demolisher or secondary metals recycler has unknowingly and unwilfully violated any provisions of this section. The hearing and any administrative review must be conducted in accordance with the procedure for contested cases under the Administrative Procedures Act. The proceeds from the administrative fine must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the Department of Motor Vehicles to defray the expenses of implementing this section.\n\n(4) A vehicle used to transport a vehicle or vehicle parts, as applicable, illegally disposed of in violation of this section may be seized by law enforcement and is subject to forfeiture; provided, however, that no vehicle is subject to forfeiture unless it appears that the owner or other person in charge of the vehicle is a consenting party or privy to the commission of the crime, and a forfeiture of the vehicle encumbered by a security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party who had no knowledge of or consented to the act. The seizure and forfeiture must be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of Section 56-29-50.\n\n(I) The Department of Motor Vehicles shall convene a working group chaired by the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles, or the director's designee, for the purpose of assisting in the development of a form affidavit to be used for the disposal of vehicles to demolishers or secondary metals recyclers, the development of an electronic system for demolishers and secondary metals recyclers to use to verify at the time of a transaction whether a vehicle has been reported stolen, and assisting in the development of forms and regulations pursuant to this section. The working group must consist of representatives from the demolishing industry, secondary metals recycling industry, trucking industry, law enforcement agencies, and other relevant agencies, organizations, or industries as determined by the director, or the director's designee.\n\nHISTORY: 1996 Act No. 459, Section 211; 2009 Act No. 26, Section 9, eff June 2, 2009; 2012 Act No. 242, Section 9, eff June 18, 2012; December 15, 2012.",

The vehicle must be confiscated by the arresting officer or other law enforcement officer of that agency at the time of arrest. The officer shall deliver it immediately to the sheriff, chief of police, or the authorized agent of the sheriff or chief of police, in the jurisdiction where the motor vehicle was confiscated. The sheriff, chief of police, or the authorized agent of the sheriff or chief of police shall by certified mail notify the registered owner of the confiscation within seventy-two hours. Upon notification of the confiscation, the registered owner has ten days to request a hearing before the presiding judge of the judicial circuit or his designated hearing officer. The hearing must be held within ten days from the date of receipt of the request. The purpose of the hearing is to determine if there is a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the use of the vehicle on the occasion of the arrest was not expressly or impliedly authorized, or (2) the registered owner did not know that the driver did not possess a valid license. If the requisite showing is made, the vehicle must be returned to the registered owner. The vehicle confiscated pursuant to this section may be returned to the registered owner upon petition to the court by the law enforcement agency confiscating the vehicle if the criminal charge has not been disposed of within twelve months of the date of confiscation. If the registered owner of the vehicle does not remove the vehicle from law enforcement's possession within ten days of service of the court order allowing the return, law enforcement may dispose of the vehicle as provided in subsection (C). The sheriff or chief of police in possession of the vehicle must provide notice by certified mail of the confiscation to all lienholders of record within ten days of the confiscation.\n\n(B) If a person fails to file an appeal within ten days after his conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the offenses in subsection (A), the sheriff or chief of police shall initiate an action in the circuit court of the county in which the vehicle was confiscated to accomplish forfeiture by giving notice pursuant to subsection (C) to registered owners, lienholders of record, and other persons claiming an interest in the vehicle subject to forfeiture and by giving these persons an opportunity to appear at a hearing and show why the vehicle should not be forfeited and disposed of as provided in subsection (C). The failure of the lienholder to appear at the hearing does not in any way alter or affect the claim of a lienholder of record. Forfeiture of a vehicle is subordinate in priority to all valid liens and encumbrances. The court, after hearing, shall order that the vehicle be forfeited to the sheriff or chief of police and sold in the manner provided in subsection (C), or returned to the registered owner. The court shall order a vehicle returned to the registered owner if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the use of the vehicle on the occasion of arrest was not expressly or impliedly authorized, or (2) the registered owner did not know that the driver did not possess a valid driver's license. Otherwise, the court shall order the vehicle forfeited and disposed of in the manner provided in subsection (C).\n\n(C) A forfeited vehicle with a fair market value of more than five hundred dollars must be disposed of pursuant to Section 56-5-5640 for abandoned vehicles, except that any remaining proceeds from the sale must be deposited in the general fund of the county or municipality. If the fair market value of the vehicle is less than five hundred dollars, it must be sold as scrap to the highest bidder after first receiving at least two bids.\n\n(D) If the registered owner, new purchaser, or lienholder believes the towing, preservation, and storage costs are excessive, he may petition the magistrate in the jurisdiction where the vehicle was taken into custody to determine the fair market price of the services.\n\n(E) Nothing contained in this section shall alter a contractual obligation in an existing insurance policy.\n\nHISTORY: 1988 Act No. 532, Section 26; 1992 Act No. 465, Section 1; 1998 Act No. 434, Section 13; 1999 Act No. 115, Section 1; 2002 Act No. 195, Section 2.",
