A dealer is not required to disclose to a purchaser that the glass, tires, bumper, or in-dash equipment of or in a new motor vehicle was damaged if the equipment or item has been replaced with original or comparable new equipment.\n\n(C) If disclosure is not required under this section, a purchaser may not revoke or rescind a sales contract nor bring a civil action based solely upon the fact that the new motor vehicle was damaged and repaired before completion of the sale.\n\n(D) For purposes of this section, \"manufacturer's suggested retail price\" means the retail price of the new motor vehicle suggested by the manufacturer including the retail delivered price suggested by the manufacturer for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the new motor vehicle at the time of delivery to the motor vehicle dealer.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 51, Section 1, eff May 17, 1995.",
