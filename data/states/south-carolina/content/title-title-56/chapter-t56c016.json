      "text": "Every manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division shall fulfill any warranty agreement and compensate each of its motorcycle dealers for labor and parts. In determination of what constitutes reasonable compensation under this section, the principal factor to be given consideration is the prevailing wage rates paid by dealers in the community in which the dealer is doing business. The hourly labor rate paid to a dealer for warranty services must not be less than the rate charged by the dealer for like service to nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty service and repairs unless the rate is determined to be unreasonable. Dealers must be reimbursed for the current manufacturer suggested retail price for parts used on warranty work. All claims made by motorcycle dealers hereunder and under Section 56-16-20 for labor and parts must be paid within thirty days following their approval. All such claims are either approved or disapproved within thirty days after their receipt. When any claim is disapproved the motorcycle dealer who submits it must be notified in writing of its disapproval within such period, and each notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based. Any special handling of claims required by the manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, which is not uniformly required of all dealers of the type make, may be enforced after thirty days' notice in writing and upon good and sufficient reason.

      "text": "If a manufacturer seeks to enter into a franchise establishing an additional new motorcycle dealership or relocating an existing new motorcycle dealership in a relevant market area where the line make is represented, the manufacturer shall, in writing, first notify each new motorcycle dealer in this line make in the relevant market area of the intention to establish an additional dealership or to relocate an existing dealership in the market area. The relevant market area is a radius of three miles around an existing dealership. Within fifteen days of receiving the notice or within fifteen days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, the new motorcycle dealership may commence a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction challenging the establishing or relocating of the new motorcycle dealership. Thereafter, the manufacturer shall not establish or relocate the proposed new motorcycle dealership unless the court has determined that there is good cause for permitting the establishment or relocation of the motorcycle dealership. The reopening in a relevant market area of a new motorcycle dealership within two miles of a location at which a former dealership of the same line make had been in operation within the previous two years is not considered the establishment of a new motorcycle dealership. The relocation of an existing dealer within its area of responsibility as defined in the franchise agreement is not subject to this section if the proposed relocation site is not within five miles of an existing dealer of the same line make. In determining whether good cause has been established for not entering into or relocating an additional franchise for the same line make, the court shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to: (a) the permanency of the investment; (b) the effect on the retail new motorcycle business and the consuming public in the relevant market area; (c) whether it is injurious to the public welfare for an additional new motor dealership to be established; (d) whether the new motorcycle dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient consumer care for the motorcycles of the line make in the market area including the adequacy of motorcycle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of motorcycle parts, and qualified service personnel; (e) whether the new motorcycle dealers of the same line make in the relevant market area are providing adequate market penetration and representation. Good cause is not shown solely by a desire for further market penetration; (f) whether the establishment of an additional new motorcycle dealership would increase competition and therefore be in the public interest; and (g) the growth or decline in population and new motorcycle registrations in the relevant market area.

(2) It is a violation of paragraph (a) of Section 56-16-90 for a manufacturer, a distributor, a wholesaler, a distributor branch or division, a factory branch or division, or a wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, to coerce, or attempt to coerce, any motorcycle dealer: (a) To order or accept delivery of any motorcycle, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories therefor, or any other commodity or commodities which such motorcycle dealer has not voluntarily ordered. (b) To order or accept delivery of any motorcycle with special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment not included in the list price of the motorcycle as publicly advertised by the manufacturer thereof. (c) To order for any person any parts, accessories, equipment, machinery, tools, appliances, or any commodity whatsoever. (3) It is a violation of paragraph (a) of Section 56-16-90 for a manufacturer, a distributor, a wholesaler, a distributor branch or division, a factory branch or division, or a wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof: (a) To refuse to deliver, in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of dealer's order, to any motorcycle dealer having a franchise or contractual arrangement for the retail sale of new motor vehicles sold or distributed by such manufacturer, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, any such motorcycles as are covered by such franchise or contract specifically publicly advertised by such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division to be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any motorcycle is not a violation of this chapter if the failure is due to an act of God, work stoppage, or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of materials, freight embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, has no control. (b) To coerce, or attempt to coerce, any motorcycle dealer to enter into any agreement with such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, or to do any other act prejudicial to such dealer by threatening to cancel any franchise or any contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, and such dealer. Notice in good faith to any motorcycle dealer of such dealer's violation of any terms or provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement is not a violation of this chapter. (c) To terminate or cancel the franchise or selling agreement of any dealer without due cause. The nonrenewal of a franchise or selling agreement, without due cause, is an unfair termination or cancellation, regardless of the terms or provisions of the franchise or selling agreement. The manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representatives thereof shall notify a motorcycle dealer in writing of the termination or cancellation of the franchise or selling agreement of the dealer at least sixty days before the effective date thereof, stating the specific grounds for such termination or cancellation; and such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof shall notify a motorcycle dealer in writing at least sixty days before the contractual term of his franchise or selling agreement expires that it will not be renewed, stating the specific grounds for such nonrenewal in those cases where there is no intention to renew, and in no event shall the contractual term of any such franchise or selling agreement expire, without the written consent of the motorcycle dealer involved, prior to the expiration of at least sixty days following such written notice. During the sixty-day period, either party may in appropriate circumstances petition a court to modify the sixty-day stay or to extend it pending a final determination of the proceedings on the merits. The court has authority to grant preliminary and final injunctive relief. (d) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his business as such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof. (e) To offer to sell or to sell any new motorcycle to any motorcycle dealer at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any other motorcycle dealer for the same model cycle similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which result in such lesser actual price. The provisions of this item do not apply to sales to a motorcycle dealer for resale to any unit of the United States Government, the State, or any of its political subdivisions. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to sales to a motorcycle dealer of any motorcycle ultimately sold, donated, or used by the dealer in a driver education program. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply so long as a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, offers to sell or sells new motorcycles to all motorcycle dealers at an equal price. This provision does not apply to sales by manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler to the United States Government or any agency thereof. (f) To offer to sell or to sell parts or accessories to any new motorcycle dealer for use in his own business for the purpose of repairing or replacing it on a comparable part or accessory, at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price charged to any other new motorcycle dealer for similar parts or accessories for use in his own business. In those cases where motorcycle dealers operate and serve as wholesalers of parts and accessories to retail outlets or other dealers, whether or not the dealer is regularly designated as a wholesaler, nothing herein contained may be construed to prevent a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, from selling to a motorcycle dealer who operates and services as a wholesaler of parts and accessories, such parts and accessories as may be ordered by such motorcycle dealer for resale to retail outlets, at a lower actual price than the actual price charged a motorcycle dealer who does not operate or serve as a wholesaler of parts and accessories. (g) To prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise, any motorcycle dealer from changing the capital structure of his dealership or the means by or through which he finances the operation of his dealership, provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealership and the manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, and provided the change by the dealer does not result in a change in the executive management of the dealership. (h) To prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise, any motorcycle dealer or any officer, partner, or stockholder of any motorcycle dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person or party. No dealer, officer, partner, or stockholder has the right to sell, transfer, or assign the franchise or power of management or control thereunder without the consent of the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler except that the consent is being unreasonably withheld. (i) To obtain money, goods, services, anything of value, or any other benefit from any other person with whom the motorcycle dealer does business, on account of or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and such other person, unless the benefit is promptly accounted for and transmitted to the motorcycle dealer. (j) To require a motorcycle dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter. (4) It is a violation of paragraph (a) of Section 56-16-90 for a motorcycle dealer: (a) To require a purchaser of a new motorcycle, as a condition of sale and delivery thereof, to also purchase special features, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories not desired or requested by the purchaser. This prohibition does not apply as to special features, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories which are already installed on the motorcycle when received by the dealer provided the motorcycle dealer prior to the consummation of the purchase reveals to the purchaser the substance of this paragraph. (b) To represent and sell as a new motorcycle any motorcycle which has been used and operated for demonstration purposes or which is otherwise a used motorcycle. (c) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his business as such motorcycle dealer. (5) There is created the Office of Administrator, within the Attorney General's office, and he shall appoint such personnel within his office for the purpose of regulating this chapter. The Administrator has the power to investigate, issue cease and desist orders and injunctive relief on any valid abuse connected with the sale, rental, or leasing of a new or used motorcycle. This power only applies after reasonable attempts by the consumer have been made with the seller, dealer, manufacturer, or lessor of the motorcycle to alleviate the complaint.

The bond must be given to the Department and executed by the applicant, as principal, and by a corporate surety company authorized to do business in this State, as surety. The bond must be conditioned upon the applicant or licensee complying with the provisions of the statutes applicable to the license and as indemnification for any loss or damage suffered by an owner of a motorcycle, or his legal representative, by reason of any fraud practiced or fraudulent representation made in connection with the sale or transfer of a motorcycle by a licensed dealer or wholesaler or the dealer's or wholesaler's agent acting for the dealer or wholesaler or within the scope of employment of the agent or any loss or damage suffered by reason of the violation by the dealer or wholesaler or his agent, of any of the provisions of this chapter. An owner or his legal representative who suffers the loss or damage has a right of action against the dealer or wholesaler and against the dealer's or wholesaler's surety upon the bond and may recover damages as provided in this chapter. A new bond or a proper continuation certificate must be delivered to the Department annually before the license is renewed. However, regardless of the number of years a bond remains in effect, the aggregate liability of the surety for any and all claims is limited to fifteen thousand dollars on each bond and to the amount of the actual loss incurred. The surety has the right to terminate its liability under the bond by giving the Department thirty days' written notice of its intent to cancel the bond. The cancellation does not affect any liability incurred or accrued prior to the cancellation. (3) If, during any license year, there is any change in the information that a dealer or wholesaler gave the Department in obtaining or retaining a license under this section, the licensee shall report the change to the Department within thirty days after the change occurs on the form the Department requires. (4) In the event a licensee ceases being a dealer or wholesaler, he shall, within ten days thereafter, notify the Department of this fact and return to the Department any license issued pursuant to this chapter and all current dealer license plates issued to the dealer or wholesaler.

The records must show the true name and correct address of the person or persons from whom the motorcycle was acquired and the date of the transaction; a correct description of the motorcycle, when transferred; the true name and correct address of the person to whom the motorcycle was transferred; and the date of the transaction. The description of the motorcycle must include the motorcycle identification number, make, model, type of body, and the odometer readings at the time the motorcycle was transferred to and from the dealer or wholesaler. These records must be open at all reasonable times for inspection and copying by the Department of Motor Vehicles or any of its duly authorized agents. (B) The records kept by the dealer or wholesaler must be maintained in a reasonably organized and orderly fashion with all entries being legible to the ordinary person upon inspection. Any records which are illegible or incapable of accurate interpretation by either the recordkeeper or the department's inspector or agent are not in compliance with this section. (C) If any dealer or wholesaler fails to keep the required records or fails to make them available to the department or its duly authorized agents immediately upon a reasonable request, the dealer or wholesaler is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to thirty days. The failure to keep or to make available to the department or its duly authorized agents complete records on each separate motorcycle constitutes a separate offense.
