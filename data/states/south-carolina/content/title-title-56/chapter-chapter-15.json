This does not prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source from offering voluntary incentives to the motor vehicle dealer;\n\n(5) to sell, assign, or transfer any retail installment sales contract or lease obtained by the motor vehicle dealer in connection with the sale or lease of a new motor vehicle manufactured by the manufacturer to a specified finance company, class of finance companies, leasing company, class of leasing companies, or to any other specified person.\n\n(D) It shall be deemed a violation of Section 56-15-30(a) for a manufacturer, a distributor, a wholesaler, a distributor branch or division, a factory branch or division, or a wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent or other representative thereof:\n\n(1) to refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of dealer's order, to any motor vehicle dealer having a franchise or contractual arrangement for the retail sale of new motor vehicles sold or distributed by such manufacturer, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, any such motor vehicles as are covered by such franchise or contract specifically publicly advertised by such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division to be available for immediate delivery; provided, however, the failure to deliver any motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this chapter if such failure be due to an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of materials, freight embargo or other cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, shall have no control;\n\n(2) to coerce, or attempt to coerce, any motor vehicle dealer to enter into any agreement with such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent or other representative thereof, or to do any other act prejudicial to such dealer by threatening to cancel any franchise or any contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, and such dealer; provided, however, that notice in good faith to any motor vehicle dealer of such dealer's violation of any terms or provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement shall not constitute a violation of this chapter;\n\n(3) to terminate or cancel the franchise or selling agreement of any such dealer without due cause. The nonrenewal of a franchise or selling agreement, without due cause, shall constitute an unfair termination or cancellation, regardless of the terms or provisions of such franchise or selling agreement. Such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent or other representatives thereof shall notify a motor vehicle dealer in writing of the termination or cancellation of the franchise or selling agreement of such dealer at least ninety days before the effective date thereof, stating the specific grounds for such termination or cancellation, except that such notification may not be provided less than fifteen days before the effective date of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal with respect to any of the following: (a) insolvency of the new motor vehicle dealer, or filing of any petition by or against the new motor vehicle dealer under any bankruptcy or receivership law; (b) failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to conduct its customary sales and service operations during its customary business hours for seven consecutive business days, except for acts of God or circumstances beyond the direct control of the new motor vehicle dealer; (c) revocation of any license which the new motor vehicle dealer is required to have to operate a dealership; or (d) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, under the laws of this State or any other state, territory, or the District of Columbia; and such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent or other representative thereof shall notify a motor vehicle dealer in writing by registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested at least ninety days before the contractual term of his franchise or selling agreement expires that the same will not be renewed, stating the specific grounds for such nonrenewal in those cases where there is no intention to renew, and in no event shall the contractual term of any such franchise or selling agreement expire, without the written consent of the motor vehicle dealer involved, prior to the expiration of at least ninety days following such written notice, or before the expiration of at least fifteen days following written notice of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal for any of the following: (a) insolvency of the new motor vehicle dealer, or filing of any petition by or against the new motor vehicle dealer under any bankruptcy or receivership law; (b) failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to conduct its customary sales and service operations during its customary business hours for seven consecutive business days, except for acts of God or circumstances beyond the direct control of the new motor vehicle dealer; (c) revocation of any license which the new motor vehicle dealer is required to have to operate a dealership; or (d) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, under the laws of this State or any other state, territory, or the District of Columbia. During a termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal requiring the ninety-day notification period, either party may in appropriate circumstances petition a court to modify such ninety-day stay or to extend it pending a final determination of such proceedings on the merits. The court shall have authority to grant preliminary and final injunctive relief. A dealer who receives notice of franchise termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal as provided herein shall continue to have the right to assign, sell, or transfer the franchise to a third party under the franchise and pursuant to Section 56-15-70 unless otherwise ordered by a court and until franchise termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is effective;\n\n(4) to resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his business as such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent or other representative thereof;\n\n(5) to offer to sell or to sell any new motor vehicle to any motor vehicle dealer at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but not limited to, a sales promotion plan or a program which results in such lesser actual price; provided, however, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle dealer for resale to any unit of the United States Government, the State or any of its political subdivisions; and provided, further, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle dealer of any motor vehicle ultimately sold, donated or used by such dealer in a driver education program; and provided, further, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply so long as a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, offers to sell or sells new motor vehicles to all motor vehicle dealers at an equal price. This provision shall not apply to sales by manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler to the United States Government or any agency thereof;\n\n(6) to wilfully discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price between different purchasers of a commodity of like grade or quality where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or to injure or destroy the business of a competitor;\n\n(7) to offer to sell or to sell parts or accessories to any new motor vehicle dealer for use in his own business for the purpose of repairing or replacing the same on a comparable part or accessory, at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price charged to any other new motor vehicle dealer for similar parts or accessories for use in his own business; provided, however, in those cases where motor vehicle dealers operate and serve as wholesalers of parts and accessories to retail outlets or other dealers, whether or not such dealer is regularly designated as a wholesaler, nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, from selling to such motor vehicle dealer who operates and services as a wholesaler of parts and accessories, such parts and accessories as may be ordered by such motor vehicle dealer for resale to retail outlets, at a lower actual price than the actual price charged a motor vehicle dealer who does not operate or serve as a wholesaler of parts and accessories;\n\n(8) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise, any motor vehicle dealer from changing the capital structure of his dealership or the means by or through which he finances the operation of his dealership, provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealership and the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, and provided such change by the dealer does not result in a change in the executive management of the dealership;\n\n(9) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise, any motor vehicle dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person or persons or party or parties; provided, however, that no dealer, officer, partner or stockholder shall have the right to sell, transfer or assign the franchise or power of management or control thereunder without the consent of the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler except that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If a manufacturer or distributor objects, then the objection must state the reasons for the denial of the request. A copy must be provided to the motor vehicle dealer by certified mail, return receipt requested, within forty-five days of the receipt of the dealer candidate's application and all documents reasonably required by the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;\n\n(10) to obtain money, goods, services, anything of value, or any other benefit from any other person with whom the motor vehicle dealer does business, on account of or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and such other person, unless such benefit is promptly accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;\n\n(11) to require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter;\n\n(12) to allocate its products within this State in a manner that provides any of its franchised dealers an unfair, unreasonable, and inequitable supply of products and vehicles by series, product line, and model, based on each dealer's historical selling pattern as compared to other same line-make dealers. Additionally, a manufacturer or distributor may not establish a specific sales performance standard that does not take into account the actual vehicle allocation offered to the dealer by the manufacturer or distributor, as well as the dealer's inventory levels relevant to achieve any minimum performance standards to which the manufacturer or distributor holds the dealer accountable; provided, however, the failure to provide allocation of any products or vehicles, including by series, product line, or model, may not be considered a violation of this chapter if such failure is due to an act of God, natural disaster, force majeure, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of materials, production limitation, freight embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, has no control, including the dealer's refusal or declination to accept product allocation offered; or\n\n(13) to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a dealer that is constructing, renovating, or substantially altering its dealership facility to purchase goods or services from a vendor selected, identified, or designated by a manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source if the dealer may obtain goods or services, that are of substantially similar material, quality, and design to those required by the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source from a vendor selected by the dealer. Prior to selecting a vendor, the dealer must obtain approval from the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source. Approval may not be unreasonably withheld. If the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source claims that a vendor selected by the dealer cannot supply substantially similar goods or services, then the dealer may file a protest with the court of common pleas. The court shall conduct a hearing on the merits of the protest within ninety days following the filing of a response to the protest. The manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source shall bear the burden of proving that the goods or services chosen by the dealer are not of substantially similar material, quality, and design to those required by the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source. Nothing in this item may be construed to allow a dealer to impair or eliminate a manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source's intellectual property or trademark rights and trade dress usage guidelines or impair other intellectual property interests owned or controlled by the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source, including the design and use of signs. This section does not apply to any facility or premise improvement or alteration that is voluntarily agreed to by the new motor vehicle dealer and for which the dealer receives facilities-related compensation from the manufacturer or distributor for the facility improvement or alteration equivalent to at least a majority of the cost incurred by the dealer for the facility improvement or alteration.\n\n(E) It shall be deemed a violation of Section 56-15-30(a) for a motor vehicle dealer:\n\n(1) To require a purchaser of a new motor vehicle, as a condition of sale and delivery thereof, to also purchase special features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories not desired or requested by the purchaser; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply as to special features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories which are already installed on the car when received by the dealer; provided, further, that the motor vehicle dealer prior to the consummation of the purchase reveals to the purchaser the substance of this item.\n\n(2) To represent and sell as a new motor vehicle any motor vehicle which has been used and operated for demonstration purposes or which is otherwise a used motor vehicle.\n\n(3) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his business as such motor vehicle dealer.\n\n(F) There is hereby created the Office of Administrator, within the Attorney General's office, and he shall appoint such personnel within his office for the purpose of regulating this chapter. The Administrator shall have the power to investigate, issue cease and desist orders and injunctive relief on any valid abuse connected with the sale, rental or leasing of a new or used motor vehicle; provided, however, this power shall only apply after reasonable attempts by the consumer have been made with the seller, dealer, manufacturer or lessor of the motor vehicle to alleviate the complaint.\n\n(G) A manufacturer or distributor may not use any financial services company, captive finance source, or leasing company owned or controlled by the manufacturer or distributor to accomplish what would otherwise be illegal conduct on the part of the manufacturer or distributor pursuant to subsection (C)(4) or (5).\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-150.154; 1972 (57) 2419; 2013 Act No. 44, Sections 2.A, 2.B, eff June 7, 2013; 2021 Act No. 31 (S.510), Section 4, eff August 4, 2021.",

The manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for the warranty services the manufacturer or distributor requires the dealer to provide, including warranty and recall obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles of the manufacturer or distributor and all parts and components authorized by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for installation in such motor vehicles.\n\n(C)(1) The manufacturer or distributor shall provide to the dealer a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable compensation the manufacturer or distributor will pay to the dealer for the warranty services, including for parts, labor, and diagnostics. For parts and labor warranty reimbursement, reasonable compensation shall not be less than the rate charged by the dealer for like services to nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty parts, service, and repairs if the dealer has submitted a request for retail reimbursement pursuant to item (4).\n\n(2) If the dealer has requested retail reimbursement pursuant to item (4), the schedule of compensation for parts must be determined by multiplying the price paid by the dealer for warranty parts by the sum of one and the dealer's average percentage markup. The dealer's average percentage markup is calculated by subtracting one from the result of dividing the total amounts charged by the dealer for parts used in warranty-like repairs by the total cost to the dealer for the parts in the retail service orders submitted pursuant to item (4).\n\n(3) If the dealer has requested retail reimbursement pursuant to item (4), the schedule of compensation for labor-related warranty services must be determined by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable to labor for warranty-like services by the number of hours of labor spent to generate the retail sales in the retail service orders submitted pursuant to item (4).\n\n(4)(a) The dealer may establish its retail average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by submitting to the manufacturer copies of one hundred sequential retail service orders paid by the dealer's customers, or all of the dealer's retail service orders paid by the dealer's customers in a ninety-day period, whichever is less, for services provided within the previous one hundred eighty-day period. The manufacturer or distributor may not consider retail service orders or portions of retail service orders attributable to the following types of repairs:\n\n(i) repairs to motor vehicles owned by the dealer;\n\n(ii) repairs made pursuant to manufacturer special events and manufacturer discounted service campaigns;\n\n(iii) parts sold at wholesale or discounted by a dealer for repairs made to government vehicles or insurance work for which volume discounts have been negotiated;\n\n(iv) tires;\n\n(v) routine maintenance such as alignments, flushes, oil changes, brake pads or rotors, lightbulbs, fluids, filters, batteries, belts, and hoses;\n\n(vi) nuts, bolts, fasteners, and similar items that do not have an individual part number.\n\n(b) Within thirty days of receiving the dealer's submission, the manufacturer or distributor may request additional necessary documentation to support the submitted orders. If the manufacturer or distributor requests additional documentation to support the submission, then the time period in which the manufacturer or distributor must approve or deny the establishment of the franchise motor vehicle dealer's average percentage markup must be extended by thirty days. The manufacturer or distributor then shall approve or deny the establishment of the dealer's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the manufacturer or distributor approves the establishment of the dealer's average percentage markup or labor rate, the markup or rate calculated under this subitem goes into effect thirty days after the date of the manufacturer's or distributor's approval.\n\n(c) A manufacturer or distributor may not require a dealer to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a methodology, or by requiring the submission of information, that is unduly burdensome or time-consuming to the dealer including, but not limited to, requiring part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations.\n\n(d) A dealer may not request a change in the dealer's average percentage markup or labor rate more than once in any twelve-month period.\n\n(D)(1) If a manufacturer or distributor provides a part or component to a dealer at reduced or no cost for repairs completed because of a recall, campaign service action, or warranty repair, then the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for the part or component in the same manner as compensation for warranty parts based on the dealer's average markup less the cost for the part or component as listed in the manufacturer's or distributor's price schedule.\n\n(2) A manufacturer may not take or threaten to take any adverse action against a dealer seeking to obtain compensation pursuant to this subsection including, but not limited to, creating or implementing an obstacle or process that is inconsistent with the manufacturer's obligations to the dealer.\n\n(3) Within thirty days of receiving a manufacturer's notice of denial of the dealer's parts or labor submission, a new motor vehicle dealer may file a protest with the court of common pleas to protest a manufacturer's denial. If a protest is filed, then the manufacturer possesses the burden of proof to establish that the dealer's submission did not meet the respective submission requirements contained within this subsection or is inaccurate or unreasonable. If a dealer prevails in a protest filed under this subsection, then the dealer's increased parts or labor reimbursement must be provided retroactively as of the date the submission would have been effective but for the manufacturer's denial.\n\n(E) It is a violation of this section for any new motor vehicle manufacturer to fail to:\n\n(1) perform any warranty obligations; or\n\n(2) compensate any new motor vehicle dealer for repairs effected by a recall.\n\n(F)(1) All claims made by a new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to this section for labor and parts shall be paid within thirty days following approval; provided, however, that the manufacturer may audit claims for up to one year after payment and charge the dealer for fraudulent claims, work done unnecessarily, or work not properly performed. All claims must be approved or disapproved within thirty days after receipt on forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after receipt shall be construed to be approved and payment must follow within thirty days.\n\n(2) The manufacturer or distributor shall not disapprove a reimbursement claim if the dealer can substantiate the claim, in accordance with the manufacturer's reasonable policies and procedures. A claim may not be denied or charged back due to a dealer's unintentional administrative error if the claim meets the requirements of this subsection. The one-year limitation on the manufacturer's right to audit a claim shall not be in effect in the case of fraudulent claims.\n\n(G)(1) Any audit for warranty or recall parts, service compensation, or compensation for a qualifying used motor vehicle in accordance with subsection (I) only may be conducted once within any twelve-month period and only must be for the twelve-month period immediately following the date of the payment of the claim by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.\n\n(2) Any audit for sales incentives, service incentives, rebates, or other forms of incentive compensation only may be conducted once within any twelve-month period and only must be for the twelve-month period immediately following the date of the payment of the claim by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch pursuant to a sales incentives program, service incentives program, rebate program, or other form of incentive compensation program.\n\n(3) The limitations of this subsection do not apply to fraudulent claims.\n\n(H) A manufacturer or distributor shall not charge a dealer back for sales incentives, service incentives, rebates, or other forms of incentive compensation subsequent to the payment of the claim unless it can be shown that the claim was false, fraudulent, or that the dealer failed to reasonably substantiate the claim in accordance with the manufacturer's reasonable written procedures.\n\n(I)(1) A manufacturer shall compensate its new motor vehicle dealers for all labor and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs. Compensation for recall repairs must be reasonable. If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall service or repair on a used vehicle held for sale by a dealer authorized to sell and service new vehicles of the same line make within thirty days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall, and the manufacturer has issued a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order on the vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer at a prorated rate of at least one percent of the value of the vehicle each month beginning on the date that is thirty days after the date on which the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was provided to the dealer until the earlier of either of the following:\n\n(a) The date the recall or remedy parts are made available.\n\n(b) The date the dealer sells, trades, or otherwise disposes of the affected used motor vehicle.\n\n(2) The value of a used vehicle must be the average trade-in value for used vehicles as indicated in an independent third-party guide for the year, make, and model of the recalled vehicle.\n\n(3) This subsection only applies to used vehicles subject to safety or emissions recalls pursuant to and recalled in accordance with federal law and regulations and where a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order has been issued and repair parts or remedy remain unavailable for thirty days or longer. This subsection further applies only to new motor vehicle dealers holding an affected used vehicle for sale:\n\n(a) in inventory at the time the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was issued;\n\n(b) which was taken in the used vehicle inventory of the dealer as a consumer trade in incident to the purchase of a new vehicle from the dealer after the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was issued; and\n\n(c) that is a line make that the dealer is franchised to sell or on which the dealer is authorized to perform recall repairs.\n\n(4) Subject to the audit provisions of subsection (G)(1), it is a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount of compensation otherwise owed to an individual new motor vehicle dealer, whether through a chargeback, removal of the individual dealer from an incentive program, or reduction in amount owed under an incentive program solely because the new motor vehicle dealer has submitted a claim for reimbursement under this section. This item does not apply to an action by a manufacturer that is applied uniformly among all dealers of the same line-make in the State.\n\n(5) All reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order, is subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement claim made under this section. In the alternative, a manufacturer may compensate its franchised dealers under a national recall compensation program, provided the compensation under the program is equal to or greater than that provided under this subsection; or as the manufacturer and dealer otherwise agree.\n\n(6) A manufacturer may direct the manner and method in which a dealer shall demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this section, provided that the manner and method may not be unduly burdensome and may not require information that is unduly burdensome to provide.\n\n(7) Nothing in this section requires a manufacturer to provide total compensation to a dealer which would exceed the total average trade-in value of the affected used motor vehicle as originally determined under item (2).\n\n(8) Any remedy provided to a dealer under this subsection is exclusive and may not be combined with any other state or federal recall compensation remedy.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-150.156; 1972 (57) 2419; 2000 Act No. 287, Section 3; 2013 Act No. 44, Section 4, eff June 7, 2013; 2021 Act No. 31 (S.510), Section 8, eff August 4, 2021.",
