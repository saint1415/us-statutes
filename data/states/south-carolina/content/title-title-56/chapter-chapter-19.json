      "text": "(A) Any liens or encumbrances on a motor vehicle or titled mobile home must be noted on the printed title or electronically through the Department of Motor Vehicles' Electronic Title and Lien System. The department shall transmit the lien to the first lienholder and notify the first lienholder of additional liens. This transmittal must be done electronically for business entities or by paper certificate for nonbusiness entities (persons purchasing vehicles for personal use from persons selling vehicles they have used primarily for personal use). Lien recordings and subsequent lien satisfactions may be electronically transmitted to the department and shall include the name and address of the person satisfying the lien. Electronic transmission of liens and lien satisfaction does not require a certificate of title until the last lien is satisfied and a clear certificate of title is issued to the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home. The owner has the option to retain the electronic copy of the title with the department once all liens are satisfied. When a motor vehicle or mobile home is subject to an electronic lien, the certificate of title for the motor vehicle or mobile home is considered to be physically held by the lienholder for purposes of compliance with state or federal odometer disclosure requirements, and a duly certified copy of the department's electronic record of the lien is admissible in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding in this State as evidence of the existence of the lien. The lienholder shall have the option to receive a paper certificate of title and to receive notices of subsequent liens and satisfaction of liens by way of the United States Postal Service. Business entities are subject to fees contained in subsection (D).\n\n(B) The department is authorized to convene a working group chaired by the director of the department or his designee for the purpose of assisting in the development of program specifications governing the transmission of electronic lien information between lienholders and the department, and maximize the use of the program by various lien stakeholders. The working group will be composed of members of the lienholder community, representing applicable industries. The director is authorized to appoint members of the working group to ensure that all stakeholders are represented. The working group will be a standing group convened on a regular basis until all specifications have been developed. The department also is charged with promulgating regulations pursuant to the specifications and standards for lien recording and releasing developed by the working group.\n\n(C) All entities submitting lien information electronically under this program are required to comply with all regulations.\n\n(D) The department is authorized to collect a transaction fee from commercial entities who either transmit or retrieve data from the department pursuant to this section. The fee must not exceed five dollars for each transaction and must be agreed to as part of the program specifications developed by the working group. These fees must be placed by the State Treasurer into the State Highway Fund as established by Section 57-11-20, to be distributed as provided in Section 11-43-167.\n\n(E) Commercial entities and lenders who either transmit or retrieve data from the department pursuant to this section, notwithstanding Sections 37-2-202 and 37-3-202, may collect transaction fees from owners of the vehicles or mobile homes not to exceed a fee of five dollars for each transaction which must be agreed to as part of the program specifications developed by the working group. All fees charged by the department to any party as to a titled motor vehicle, motor home, or mobile home for purposes of transmittal or retrieval of this data is an \"official fee\" as referenced in Sections 37-2-202 and 37-3-202.\n\n(F) All businesses and commercial lienholders who are regularly engaged in the business or practice of selling motor vehicles as dealers licensed under Chapter 15 of this title or in the business or practice of financing motor vehicles shall utilize the electronic lien system to transmit and receive electronic lien information as described by subsection (A). The department shall maintain contact information on its website for service providers providing an electronic interface between the department, lienholders and sellers of motor vehicles. The department may establish procedures to ensure businesses comply with use of the electronic lien system and to deal with valid exceptions as determined by the department.\n\n(G) Any lien upon a vehicle titled by the State, except upon vehicles defined as motor homes, mobile homes, special mobile equipment, or commercial trucks, shall be deemed effective for a period of twelve years from the date the lien was perfected. The effectiveness of the lien lapses at the end of this twelve-year period unless a continuation statement is filed pursuant to this subsection by the entity existing on the current title as lienholder using the application process acceptable by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The department shall publish forms for the purpose of filing a continuation statement. The lienholder shall not make application for lien continuation until no more than six months prior to lien expiration. Upon a timely filing of a continuation statement in accordance with this subsection, the lien will be effective for a period of two additional years from the date of the filing of the continuation statement. The responsibility of lien continuation lies with the lender. The twelve-year effective lien period refers to the age of the lien, not the age of the vehicle.\n\nHISTORY: 2004 Act No. 274, Section 1; 2008 Act No. 290, Section 1, eff June 11, 2008; 2014 Act No. 201 (H.3904), Section 2, eff June 2, 2014; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Section 82, eff July 1, 2016; 2016 Act No. 245 (H.5089), Section 2, eff February 1, 2017.",

      "text": "(A) An owner who scraps, dismantles, destroys, or in any manner disposes to another, except to a demolisher or secondary metals recycler, as salvage, a motor vehicle otherwise required to be titled in this State immediately shall mail or deliver to the Department of Motor Vehicles the vehicle's certificate of title notifying the department to whom the vehicle is delivered together with a report indicating the type and severity of any damage to the vehicle. A person or entity who disposes of a vehicle to a demolisher or secondary metals recycler shall provide the vehicle's title certificate to the demolisher or secondary metals recycler so that the demolisher or secondary metals recycler can surrender the title certificate to the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Sections 56-5-5670 and 56-5-5945.\n\n(B) If a vehicle is acquired by an insurance company in settlement of a claim to the vehicle by fire, flood, collision, or other causes, or is left with the claimant after being declared a total loss by the insurance company, the company or its agent immediately shall deliver to the department the certificate of title together with a report indicating the type and severity of damage to the vehicle. If an insurance company or its agent is unable to obtain the certificate of title from the claimant within thirty days after acceptance by the claimant of an offer in settlement of total loss, the insurance company or its agent, on a form prescribed by the department, may submit an application to the department for a salvage, salvage flood, or salvage fire, as defined in Section 56-1-10, certificate of title. The application shall include evidence that the insurance company or its agent has fulfilled its settlement with and made two or more written attempts to obtain the certificate of title from the claimant. At such time as the insurance company may thereafter transfer the damaged vehicle, the company or its agent shall notify the department to whom the transfer was made on a form prescribed by the department. When an insurance company obtains a title to a vehicle from settling a total loss claim, the insurance company may obtain a title to the vehicle designated as \"salvage\", \"salvage flood\", or \"salvage fire\", as defined in Section 56-1-10. The insurance company must pay the title fee contained in Section 56-19-420.\n\n(C) All insurance companies which make payments on liability, collision, fire, theft, or comprehensive policies for damaged motor vehicles in this State shall allow department officials to examine all records of the company which pertain to payments made pursuant to the policies during normal working hours.\n\n(D) Vehicles acquired by insurance companies as outlined above are exempt from ad valorem property taxes and inventory taxes, and the transfers of the vehicles to and from insurance companies exempt from sales taxes.\n\n(E) If a salvage, salvage flood, or salvage fire vehicle is rebuilt, a regular certificate of title may not again be issued except upon submission of an application stating that the vehicle has been rebuilt and containing the information ordinarily required by the department for the issuance of a certificate of title as well as any information the department may require about the identity of the vehicle, the source and cost of any parts used in, and the extent of any repairs or other work done to the vehicle. The owner shall follow the procedure prescribed by the department if he is seeking a rebuilt brand on a title. Any regular certificate of title issued by the department for a previously salvaged vehicle must be annotated to show that the vehicle was \"salvaged rebuilt\" and the reason why the vehicle was \"salvage rebuilt\", \"salvage flood rebuilt\", or \"salvage fire rebuilt\".\n\n(F) The manufacturer's serial plate or vehicle identification number (VIN) plate must remain with the vehicle at all times until the vehicle is shredded, crushed, melted, or otherwise destroyed.\n\n(G) For purposes of this section, a \"salvage vehicle\", and a \"vehicle declared to be a total loss\" are all synonyms and are defined to be any motor vehicle which is damaged to the extent that the cost of repairing the motor vehicle, including both parts and reasonable market charges for labor, equal or exceed seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the motor vehicle. The provisions contained in this section do not apply to a motor vehicle that has a fair market value of two thousand dollars or less, or an antique motor vehicle as defined by Section 56-3-2210. When an insurance company is involved, the fair market value of the vehicle must be determined as of the date immediately before the event which gave rise to the claim. When an insurance company is not involved, then the fair market value must be determined as of the last day on which the vehicle was lawfully operated on a public highway or the last day on which it was registered, whichever is later.\n\n(H) A person violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, for a first offense, must be fined not less than two nor more than five hundred dollars, or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both. For a second or subsequent offense, the fine must not be less than five hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-150.27; 1957 (50) 595; 1966 (54) 2303; 1972 (57) 2440; 1985 Act No. 198, Section 1; 1996 Act No. 459, Section 237; 2003 Act No. 52, Sections 1, 2; 2012 Act No. 242, Section 10, eff December 15, 2012; 2019 Act No. 17 (H.3310), Section 1, eff April 3, 2019; 2021 Act No. 27 (H.3101), Section 3, eff October 25, 2021.",

The department shall apply that brand to the vehicle and it should remain on the vehicle through any subsequent transfers in South Carolina. The department may add other nonsalvage brands, outside of those defined in Section 56-1-10, to vehicle titles to properly classify vehicles and the use of those vehicles as it pertains to vehicle operation in South Carolina. Any vehicle previously title-branded in another state must be title-branded as the department deems appropriate pursuant to this section without regard to whether the vehicle was subsequently titled in a jurisdiction without a title brand.\n\nThe provisions of this section apply to transfers of vehicles in all of the circumstances described in Section 56-19-480.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the owner of a vehicle whose total cost of repair, including all labor and parts, is estimated to be seventy-five percent or more of the fair market value of the vehicle must provide the Department of Motor Vehicles an affidavit from a person who reconstructs or rebuilds a vehicle indicating the cost of repair along with other data the department may prescribe to obtain a certificate of title. The provisions contained in this section do not apply to a motor vehicle that has a fair market value of two thousand dollars or less, or an antique motor vehicle as defined by Section 56-3-2210. A certificate of title issued for a vehicle described in this paragraph must be annotated to indicate the motor vehicle is designated \"salvage\" as applicable to the extent necessary to inform the transferee of the exact condition of the vehicle.
