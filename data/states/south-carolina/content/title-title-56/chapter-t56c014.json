      "text": "(A) Before engaging in business as a recreational vehicle dealer in this State, a person first must apply to the Department of Motor Vehicles for a license. Each license issued expires on the last day of the month thirty-six months from the date of issue, the \"licensing period\", and must be displayed prominently at the established place of business. The fee for the license is one hundred fifty dollars. The license applies to only one place of business of the applicant and is not transferable to another person or place of business. (B)(1) During the dealer license application process, the department shall provide all information that would be needed in an audit or a review by its agents. Upon issuing a license, the department shall be reasonable in its requests to inspect or copy a dealer's records. If a complaint has been filed against a dealer, the department must present that complaint to the dealer in writing and allow the dealer the opportunity to cure before proceeding with punitive or enforcement action. Complaints arising from alleged violations of: (a) Section 56-37-30(B) must be cured by the dealer within sixty days of being notified of the complaint; (b) Section 56-37-30(C) must be cured by the dealer within forty-five days of being notified of the complaint; or (c) Section 56-37-30(D) must be cured by the dealer within thirty days of being notified of the complaint. (2) If the department determines that the same dealer has received a similar type of complaint within twelve months of a previous complaint, the department may proceed with an enforcement action against that dealer without regard to the time period provided in this subsection. (C) A licensed South Carolina recreational vehicle dealer may exhibit and sell recreational vehicles, as defined by Section 56-14-10, at fairs, recreational or sports shows, vacation shows, and other similar events or shows upon obtaining a temporary dealer's license in the manner required by this section. No other exhibitions may be allowed, except as may be permitted by this section. Any recreational vehicle displayed must be owned by the dealer holding the temporary license. Before exhibiting and selling recreational vehicles at temporary locations, the dealer shall first apply to the department for a license. To be eligible for a temporary license, a dealer shall hold a valid recreational vehicle dealer's license issued pursuant to this chapter. Every temporary dealer's license issued is valid for a period not to exceed ten consecutive days and must be prominently displayed at the temporary place of business. No dealer may purchase more than six temporary licenses every twelve months. The fee for each temporary license issued is twenty dollars. A temporary license applies to only one dealer operating in a temporary location and is not transferable to any other dealer or location. (D) The provisions of this section may not be construed as allowing the sale of any type of motor vehicles other than recreational vehicles at authorized temporary locations. (E) A person who fails to secure either a temporary or a permanent license as required in this chapter and sells a recreational vehicle is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined: (1) not less than one hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days for the first offense; (2) five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both, for the second offense; and (3) not less than two thousand dollars or more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both, for the third or any subsequent offense. (F) For purposes of this section, each unauthorized sale of a recreational vehicle where the dealer has not applied for and received a license from the department appropriate for that sale constitutes a separate offense. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prohibit any law enforcement agency from enforcing the provisions relating to non-licensed dealers within the law enforcement agency's jurisdiction. The ticketing agency shall retain fifty percent of all fines collected pursuant to this section. (G) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a licensed recreational vehicle dealer from providing vehicles for demonstration or test driving purposes.

(B)(1) Each applicant shall furnish a surety bond in the penal amount of fifty thousand dollars on a form prescribed by the department. (2) A new bond or a proper continuation certificate must be provided to the department every twelve months during the license period. The dealer or surety, or the dealer's or surety's designee, must notify the department of any bond name or address changes during the licensing period. Notice must be provided within thirty days of a change. Proof of the bond and the proper continuation of the bond may be provided to the Department of Motor Vehicles on the same database used for vehicle insurance pursuant to Article 7, Chapter 10, Title 56. (3) A dealer's license expires immediately upon expiration or termination of a dealer's bond, or a decrease of a dealer's bond below fifty thousand dollars. (4) The bond must be given to the department and executed by the applicant, as principal, and by a corporate surety company authorized to do business in this State, as surety. (5) The bond must be conditioned upon the applicant or licensee complying with the statutes applicable to the license and as indemnification for loss or damage suffered by an owner of a recreational vehicle, or his legal representative, by reason of fraud practiced or fraudulent representation made in connection with the sale or transfer of a recreational vehicle by a licensed recreational vehicle dealer or the dealer's agent acting for the dealer, or within the scope of employment of the agent or loss or damage suffered by reason of the violation by the dealer or his agent of any provisions of this chapter. (6)(a) In instances of taxes or fees owned to the State that pertain solely to the process of buying, selling, titling, or registering vehicles by a recreational vehicle dealer, the department may maintain a cause of action against the dealer's surety bond and may recover damages if the owed taxes and fees are not paid in full within the time period prescribed by law. The department shall distribute the collected taxes and fees to the appropriate entity as prescribed by law. (b) In the event of concurrent claims for the same vehicle from the owner and the State, the owner's claim prevails. (c) This subsection does not apply to monies a recreational vehicle dealer has attempted to refund to a customer due to an error made by the dealer when the dealer can demonstrate that he has made a bona fide, good faith effort by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by private delivery service acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service to ensure the customer's refund was delivered. For purpose of this subsection, the dealer should make a bona fide, good faith effort to refund the monies due to the customer within sixty days of the date of sale. (7) An owner or his legal representative who suffers the loss or damage has a right of action against the dealer and against the dealer's surety upon the bond and may recover damages as provided in this chapter. However, regardless of the number of years a bond remains in effect, the aggregate liability of the surety for claims is limited to fifty thousand dollars on each bond and to the amount of the actual loss incurred. (8) The surety may terminate its liability under the bond by giving the department thirty days' written notice of its intent to cancel the bond. The cancellation does not affect liability incurred or accrued before the cancellation. (C) If, during a license period, there is a change in the information a dealer gave the department in obtaining or retaining a license, the licensee must report the change to the department within thirty days on a form prescribed by the department. (D) If a licensee ceases to be a recreational vehicle dealer, he shall notify the department within ten days and return any license and all dealer license plates. (E) In the event of a licensee's death, the personal representative of the deceased licensee may, with the consent of the probate court and upon an application to the department, continue the operation of the business covered by the license for the remainder of the licensing period, but no longer than eighteen months after the licensee's death. At the conclusion of the license period or eighteen months after the licensee's death, the personal representative must take all actions to apply for a recreational vehicle dealer license under his name and meet all requirements for a licensed recreational vehicle dealer in order to continue operating the business.

In the absence of a breach by the selling dealer of its dealer agreement or this chapter, the manufacturer shall not object to the proposed change in ownership unless the prospective transferee: (1) has previously been terminated by the manufacturer for breach of its dealer agreement; (2) has been convicted of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude; (3) lacks any license required by law; (4) does not have an active line of credit sufficient to purchase a manufacturer's product; or (5) has undergone in the last ten years bankruptcy, insolvency, a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or conservator to take possession of the transferee's business or property. (B) If the manufacturer objects to a proposed change of ownership, the manufacturer shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within ten business days after receipt of the dealer's notification and complete documentation. The manufacturer has the burden of proof with regard to its objection. If the manufacturer does not give timely notice of its objection, the change or sale shall be deemed approved. (C) It is unlawful for a manufacturer to fail to provide a dealer an opportunity to designate, in writing, a family member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the death, incapacity, or retirement of the dealer. It is unlawful to prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a dealership by a family member of the deceased, incapacitated, or retired dealer unless the manufacturer has provided to the dealer written notice of its objections within ten days after receipt of the dealer's modification of the dealer's succession plan. In the absence of a breach of the dealer agreement, the manufacturer may object to the succession for the following reasons only: (1) conviction of the successor of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude; (2) bankruptcy or insolvency of the successor during the past ten years; (3) prior termination by the manufacturer of the successor for breach of a dealer agreement; (4) the successor lacks an active line of credit sufficient to purchase the manufacturer's recreational vehicles; or (5) the successor lacks any license required by law. (D) The manufacturer has the burden of proof regarding its objection. However, a family member may not succeed to a dealership if the succession involves, without the manufacturer's consent, a relocation of the business or an alteration of the terms and conditions of the manufacturer/dealer agreement.

In the determination of what constitutes reasonable compensation under this section, the principal factors to be given consideration shall be the actual wage rates being paid by the dealer, and the actual retail labor rate being charged by the recreational vehicle dealers in the community in which the dealer is doing business. The compensation of a dealer for warranty labor may not be less than the lowest retail labor rates actually charged by the dealer for like nonwarranty labor as long as such rates are reasonable. (C) The warrantor shall reimburse the dealer for any warranty part at actual wholesale cost plus a minimum thirty percent handling charge and the cost, if any, of freight to return such part to the warrantor. (D) Warranty audits of dealer records may be conducted by the warrantor on a reasonable basis, and dealer claims for warranty compensation may not be denied except for cause, such as performance of nonwarranty repairs, material noncompliance with the warrantor's published policies and procedures, lack of material documentation, fraud, or misrepresentation. (E) The dealer shall submit warranty claims within forty-five days after completing work. (F) The dealer immediately shall notify the warrantor verbally or in writing if the dealer is unable to perform any warranty repairs within ten days of receipt of verbal or written complaints from a consumer.

Claims not specifically disapproved in writing within forty-five days shall be construed to be approved and must be paid within sixty days of submission. (H) It is a violation of this chapter for any warrantor to: (1) fail to perform any of its warranty obligations with respect to its warranted products; (2) fail to include, in written notices of factory campaigns to recreational vehicle owners and dealers, the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment, including tires and chassis or chassis parts, will be available to dealers to perform the campaign work. The warrantor may ship parts to the dealer to effect the campaign work, and, if such parts are in excess of the dealer's requirements, the dealer may return unused parts to the warrantor for credit after completion of the campaign; (3) fail to compensate any of its dealers for authorized repairs effected by the dealer on recreational vehicles or products damaged in manufacture or transit to the dealer, if the carrier is designated by the warrantor; (4) fail to compensate any of its dealers in accordance with the schedule of compensation provided to the dealer pursuant to this section if performed in a timely and competent manner; (5) intentionally misrepresent in any way to purchasers of recreational vehicles that warranties with respect to the manufacture, performance, or design of the vehicle are made by the dealer as warrantor or cowarrantor; or (6) require the dealer to make warranties to customers in any manner related to the manufacture of the recreational vehicle. (I) It is a violation of this chapter for any dealer to: (1) fail to perform predelivery inspection functions, as specified by the warrantor, in a competent and timely manner; (2) fail to perform warranty service work authorized by the warrantor in a competent and reasonably timely manner on any transient customer's vehicle of a line make sold or serviced by that dealer; (3) fail to accurately document the time spent completing each repair, the total number of repair attempts conducted on a single unit, and the number of repair attempts for the same repair conducted on a single vehicle; (4) fail to notify the warrantor within ten days of a second repair attempt which impairs the use, value, or safety of the vehicle; (5) fail to maintain written records, including a consumer's signature, regarding the amount of time a unit is stored for the consumer's convenience during a repair; or (6) make fraudulent warranty claims or misrepresent the terms of any warranty.
