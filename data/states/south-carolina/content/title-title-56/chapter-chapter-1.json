Upon the magistrates or municipal court receiving notice of the dependent's violation through transmittal to the court of the traffic ticket or through other means, the court shall determine the names of the parents or guardians from the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles. The court shall then notify the dependent's parents or guardians by certified mail at the address shown on the traffic ticket, unless the department's records show a different address, of the violation and the fact that they may be subject to a civil fine. Failure to receive the notice does not prohibit the imposition of the civil fine pursuant to this section. If, while operating the motor vehicle in violation of a restriction, the dependent causes great bodily injury or death, the parent or guardian must be assessed a civil fine in an amount up to one thousand dollars. The court may suspend the imposition of the fine, conditioned upon the parent or guardian completing, to the satisfaction of the court, public service with a nonprofit organization, community service, or parenting classes. This section does not apply to a motor vehicle operated on private property. A civil fine imposed pursuant to this section does not give rise to a private cause of action based solely upon the fact that the fine was imposed.

The course or program must consist of the following minimum training requirements:\n\n(a) for a person with no previous driving experience, the course shall consist of at least thirty hours of behind-the-wheel driving skills with a bioptic telescopic lens system in place and under the supervision of an ECP, CDRS, CLVT, COMS, or such other designations of qualification as recognized by the department who has certification in Bioptic Driving Training. For a person with previous driving experience, the course shall consist of at least twenty hours behind-the-wheel driving skills under the supervision of an ECP, CDRS, CLVT, COMS, or such other designations of qualification as recognized by the department who has certification in Bioptic Driving Training;\n\n(b) review and integrated reinforcement of the proper and appropriate use of the bioptic telescopic lens system while driving a motor vehicle, including cleaning and focusing procedures and vertical spotting exercises; and\n\n(c) the award of a Certificate of Completion of Training to a trainee when he successfully completes the Behind-the-Wheel Bioptic Driver's Training Program. He must present this certificate to the department in order to take the on-the-road portion of the driver's license test with his bioptic telescope system in place. He also shall provide a copy of the certificate to the supervising optometrist or ophthalmologist.\n\nThe applicant must apply for a driver's license and take the department road test within twelve months of having completed the Behind-the-Wheel Bioptic Driving Program. The road test is the same standard road test taken by all other persons applying for a regular driver's license.\n\n(D) A person who is licensed to drive using bioptic telescopic aid is subject to restrictions placed on his license. Restrictions may include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) driving only during daylight hours;\n\n(2) the vehicle being operated by the bioptic driver must be equipped with both left and right side mirrors;\n\n(3) the bioptic driver shall not be permitted to operate a motorcycle, moped, or motor scooter;\n\n(4) the bioptic driver may not drive during adverse weather conditions that significantly reduce the visibility of the roadway or other traffic and traffic control devices;\n\n(5) a maximum speed of fifty miles per hour;\n\n(6) no other mental or physical handicaps; and\n\n(7) no driving on an interstate highway.\n\nAny restrictions must be confirmed and finalized by the department's certified driver licensing examining officer. Any restrictions must be eligible for review and reconsideration after one year, as determined and recommended by the examining optometrist or ophthalmologist and approved by the department.\n\n(E) An applicant who is issued a driver's license pursuant to this section must have the low vision report updated annually within sixty days of the annual anniversary date of driver's licensure by an optometrist or ophthalmologist and submit it to the department for review. The eye care professional that examines the applicant and completes the report shall indicate at the top of the report whether the applicant's vision condition has deteriorated so that the applicant no longer meets the requirements of subsection (B)(4). The department shall review the report.\n\n(F) If the report indicates a progressive loss of vision but the applicant still meets the vision requirements of subsection (B)(4), the applicant may be required to take additional driver training and additional on-road testing before his license may be renewed.\n\n(G) If the report indicates that the applicant no longer meets the requirements of subsection (B)(4), the department immediately shall revoke the license held by the applicant. To be issued a new valid license, the applicant must retake the department-administered road test and meet the requirements of subsection (B)(4).\n\n(H) Nothing in this section permits an applicant who uses bioptic telescopic lenses for vision assistance to apply for a license to operate a motorcycle or a commercial driver's license.\n\nHISTORY: 2016 Act No. 196 (S.21), Section 1, eff June 3, 2017.",

      "text": "(A) The Department of Motor Vehicles shall suspend the driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege of, or deny the issuance of a license or permit to a person under the age of twenty-one who drives a motor vehicle and has an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more. In cases in which a law enforcement officer initiates suspension proceedings for a violation of this section, the officer has elected to pursue a violation of this section and is subsequently prohibited from prosecuting the person for a violation of Section 63-19-2440, 63-19-2450, 56-5-2930, or 56-5-2933, arising from the same incident.\n\n(B) A person under the age of twenty-one who drives a motor vehicle in this State is considered to have given consent to chemical tests of the person's breath or blood for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol.\n\n(C)(1) A law enforcement officer who has arrested a person under the age of twenty-one for a violation of Chapter 5 of this title (Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways), or any other traffic offense established by a political subdivision of this State, and has reasonable suspicion that the person under the age of twenty-one has consumed alcoholic beverages and driven a motor vehicle may order the testing of the person arrested to determine the person's alcohol concentration.\n\n(2) A law enforcement officer may detain and order the testing of a person to determine the person's alcohol concentration if the officer has reasonable suspicion that a motor vehicle is being driven by a person under the age of twenty-one who has consumed alcoholic beverages.\n\n(D)(1) A test must be administered at the direction of the primary investigating law enforcement officer. At the officer's direction, the person first must be offered a breath test to determine the person's alcohol concentration. If the person physically is unable to provide an acceptable breath sample because the person has an injured mouth or is unconscious or dead, or for any other reason considered acceptable by licensed medical personnel, a blood sample may be taken. The breath test must be administered by a person trained and certified by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, pursuant to the State Law Enforcement Division's policies. The primary investigating officer may administer the test. Blood samples must be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, or other medical personnel trained to obtain these samples in a licensed medical facility. Blood samples must be obtained and handled in accordance with procedures approved by the division. The division shall administer the provisions of this subsection and shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the subsection's provisions. The costs of the tests administered at the officer's direction must be paid from the state's general fund. However, if the person is subsequently convicted of violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945, then, upon conviction, the person shall pay twenty-five dollars for the costs of the tests. The twenty-five dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the State Law Enforcement Division to offset the costs of administration of the breath testing devices, breath testing site video program, and toxicology laboratory.\n\n(2) The person tested or giving samples for testing may have a qualified person of the person's choice conduct additional tests at the person's expense and must be notified in writing of that right. A person's request or failure to request additional blood tests is not admissible against the person in any proceeding. The person's failure or inability to obtain additional tests does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the tests or samples taken at the officer's direction. The officer shall provide affirmative assistance to the person to contact a qualified person to conduct and obtain additional tests. Affirmative assistance shall, at a minimum, include providing transportation for the person to the nearest medical facility which provides blood tests to determine a person's alcohol concentration. If the medical facility obtains the blood sample but refuses or fails to test the blood to determine the person's alcohol concentration, the State Law Enforcement Division shall test the blood and provide the result to the person and to the officer. Failure to provide affirmative assistance upon request to obtain additional tests bars the admissibility of the breath test result in a judicial or administrative proceeding.\n\n(E) A qualified person and the person's employer who obtain samples or administer the tests or assist in obtaining samples or administering of tests at the primary investigating officer's direction are immune from civil and criminal liability unless the obtaining of samples or the administering of tests is performed in a negligent, reckless, or fraudulent manner. A person may not be required by the officer ordering the tests to obtain or take any sample of blood or urine.\n\n(F) If a person refuses upon the primary investigating officer's request to submit to chemical tests as provided in subsection (C), the department shall suspend the person's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege, or deny the issuance of a license or permit to the person for:\n\n(1) six months; or\n\n(2) one year, if the person, within the three years preceding the violation of this section, has been previously convicted of violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or the person has had a previous suspension imposed pursuant to Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2951, or 56-5-2990.\n\n(G) If a person submits to a chemical test and the test result indicates an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more, the department shall suspend the person's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege, or deny the issuance of a license or permit to the person for:\n\n(1) three months; or\n\n(2) six months, if the person, within the three years preceding the violation of this section, has been previously convicted of violating Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or the person has had a previous suspension imposed pursuant to Section 56-1-286, 56-5-2951, or 56-5-2990.\n\n(H)(1) In lieu of serving the remainder of a suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit, a person may enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle equal to the length of time remaining on the person's suspension or denial of the issuance of a license or permit. If the length of time remaining is less than three months, the ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for three months.\n\n(2) The person must receive credit for the number of days the person maintained an ignition interlock restriction on the temporary alcohol license.\n\n(3) Once a person has enrolled in the Ignition Interlock Device Program and obtained an ignition interlock restricted license, the person is subject to Section 56-5-2941 and cannot subsequently choose to serve the suspension.\n\n(I) A person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be restored when the person's period of suspension or ignition interlock restricted license requirement pursuant to subsection (F) or (G) has concluded, even if the person has not yet completed the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. After the person's driving privilege is restored, the person shall continue the services of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. If the person withdraws from or in any way stops making satisfactory progress toward the completion of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, the person's license must be suspended until completion of the Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. A person shall be attending or have completed an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2990 before the person's driving privilege can be restored at the conclusion of the suspension period or ignition interlock restricted license requirement.\n\n(J)(1) A test may not be administered or samples taken unless, upon activation of the video recording equipment and prior to the commencement of the testing procedure, the person has been given a written copy of and verbally informed that:\n\n(a) the person does not have to take the test or give the samples but that the person's privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least six months if the person refuses to submit to the tests, and that the person's refusal may be used against the person in court;\n\n(b) the person's privilege to drive must be suspended for at least three months if the person takes the test or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(c) the person has the right to have a qualified person of the person's own choosing conduct additional independent tests at the person's expense;\n\n(d) the person has the right to request a contested case hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and\n\n(e) the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension if the person does not request a contested case hearing or within thirty days of the issuance of notice that the suspension has been upheld at the contested case hearing.\n\n(2) The primary investigating officer promptly shall notify the department of a person's refusal to submit to a test requested pursuant to this section as well as the test result of a person who submits to a test pursuant to this section and registers an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more. The notification must be in a manner prescribed by the department.\n\n(K) If the test registers an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more or if the person refuses to be tested, the primary investigating officer shall issue a notice of suspension, and the suspension is effective beginning on the date of the alleged violation of this section. The person, within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension, shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2990 if the person does not request an administrative hearing. If the person does not request an administrative hearing and does not enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program within thirty days, the suspension remains in effect, and a temporary alcohol license must not be issued. If the person drives a motor vehicle during the period of suspension without a temporary alcohol license, the person must be penalized for driving while the person's license is suspended pursuant to Section 56-1-460.\n\n(L)(1) Within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension the person may:\n\n(a) request a contested case hearing before the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings pursuant to its rules of procedure; and, either:\n\n(b) enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941; or\n\n(c) obtain a temporary alcohol license from the Department of Motor Vehicles. A one hundred dollar fee must be assessed for obtaining a temporary alcohol license. Twenty-five dollars of the fee must be distributed to the Department of Public Safety for supplying and maintaining all necessary vehicle videotaping equipment. The remaining seventy-five dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into the State Highway Fund as established by Section 57-11-20, to be distributed as provided in Section 11-43-167. The temporary alcohol license allows the person to drive a motor vehicle pending the outcome of the contested case hearing provided for in this section or the final decision or disposition of the matter.\n\n(2) The ignition interlock restriction must be maintained on the temporary alcohol license for three months. If the contested case hearing has not reached a final disposition by the time the ignition interlock restriction has been removed, then the person can obtain a temporary alcohol license without an ignition interlock restriction.\n\n(3) At the contested case hearing, if:\n\n(a) the suspension is upheld, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program and the person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be suspended or the person must be denied the issuance of a license or permit for the remainder of the suspension periods provided for in subsections (F) and (G); and\n\n(b) the person must enroll in the Ignition Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941.\n\n(4) If the suspension is overturned, the person's driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege must be reinstated.\n\n(M) The periods of suspension provided for in subsections (F) and (G) begin on the day the notice of suspension is issued, or at the expiration of any other suspensions, and continue until the person applies for a temporary alcohol license and requests an administrative hearing.\n\n(N) If a person does not request a contested case hearing, the person has waived the person's right to the hearing and the person's suspension must not be stayed but shall continue for the periods provided for in subsections (F) and (G).\n\n(O) The notice of suspension must advise the person of the requirement to enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program and of the person's right to obtain a temporary alcohol license and to request a contested case hearing. The notice of suspension also must advise the person that, if the person does not request a contested case hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension, the person shall enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, and the person waives the person's right to the contested case hearing, and the suspension continues for the periods provided for in subsections (F) and (G).\n\n(P) A contested case hearing must be held after the request for the hearing is received by the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings.\n\n(1) The scope of the hearing is limited to whether the person:\n\n(a) was lawfully arrested or detained;\n\n(b) was given a written copy of and verbally informed of the rights enumerated in subsection (J);\n\n(c) refused to submit to a test pursuant to this section; or\n\n(d) consented to taking a test pursuant to this section, and the:\n\n(i) reported alcohol concentration at the time of testing was two one-hundredths of one percent or more;\n\n(ii) individual who administered the test or took samples was qualified pursuant to this section;\n\n(iii) test administered and samples taken were conducted pursuant to this section; and\n\n(iv) the machine was operating properly.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section prohibits the introduction of evidence at the contested case hearing on the issue of the accuracy of the breath test result.\n\n(3) The Department of Motor Vehicles and the arresting officer shall have the burden of proof in contested case hearings conducted pursuant to this section. If neither the Department of Motor Vehicles nor the arresting officer appears at the contested case hearing, the hearing officer shall rescind the suspension of the person's license, permit, or nonresident's operating privilege regardless of whether the person requesting the contested case hearing or the person's attorney appears at the contested case hearing.\n\n(4) A written order must be issued to all parties either reversing or upholding the suspension of the person's license, permit, or nonresident's operating privilege, or denying the issuance of a license or permit. If the suspension is upheld, the person must receive credit for the number of days the person's license was suspended before the person received a temporary alcohol license and requested the contested case hearing and must receive credit for the number of days the person maintained an ignition interlock restriction on the temporary alcohol license.\n\n(Q) A contested case hearing is a contested proceeding under the Administrative Procedures Act, and a person has a right to appeal the decision of the hearing officer pursuant to that act to the Administrative Law Court in accordance with its appellate rules. The filing of an appeal shall stay the suspension until a final decision is issued.\n\n(R) A person who is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of refusal is considered to be informed and not to have withdrawn the consent provided for in subsection (B) of this section.\n\n(S) When a nonresident's privilege to drive a motor vehicle in this State has been suspended under the procedures of this section, the department shall give written notice of the action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person's residence and of any state in which he has a license or permit.\n\n(T) A person required to submit to a test must be provided with a written report including the time of arrest, the time of the tests, and the results of the tests before any proceeding in which the results of the tests are used as evidence. A person who obtains additional tests shall furnish a copy of the time, method, and results of any additional tests to the officer before any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in which the person attempts to use the results of the additional tests as evidence.\n\n(U) A person whose driver's license or permit is suspended under this section is not required to file proof of financial responsibility.\n\n(V) The department shall administer the provisions of this section, not including subsection (D), and shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out its provisions.\n\n(W) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no suspension imposed pursuant to this section is counted as a demerit or result in any insurance penalty for automobile insurance purposes if at the time the person was stopped, the person whose license is suspended had an alcohol concentration that was less than eight one-hundredths of one percent.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 434, Section 2; 2000 Act No. 390, Sections 3-5; 2001 Act No. 79, Section 2.C; 2003 Act No. 61, Section 4; 2006 Act No. 381, Section 8, eff June 13, 2006; 2008 Act No. 201, Section 2, eff February 10, 2009; 2012 Act No. 212, Section 2, eff June 7, 2012; 2012 Act No. 264, Section 2, eff June 18, 2012; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 2, eff October 1, 2014; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Section 17, eff July 1, 2016; 2023 Act No. 55 (S.36), Section 1, eff May 19, 2024; 2024 Act No. 130 (H.3518), Section 1, eff May 19, 2024.",

If the person subsequently decides to have the ignition interlock device installed, the device must be installed for the length of time set forth in subsection (B).\n\n(F) This provision does not affect nor bar the reckoning of prior offenses for reckless driving and driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs, as provided in Article 23, Chapter 5 of this title.\n\n(G)(1) A person who does not own a vehicle, as shown in the Department of Motor Vehicles' records, and who certifies that the person:\n\n(a) cannot obtain a vehicle owner's permission to have an ignition interlock device installed on a vehicle;\n\n(b) will not be driving a vehicle other than a vehicle owned by the person's employer; and\n\n(c) will not own a vehicle during the ignition interlock period, may petition the department, on a form provided by the department, for issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license that permits the person to operate a vehicle specified by the employee according to the employer's needs as contained in the employer's statement during the days and hours specified in the employer's statement without having to show that an ignition interlock device has been installed.\n\n(2) The form must contain:\n\n(a) identifying information about the employer's noncommercial vehicles that the person will be operating;\n\n(b) a statement that explains the circumstances in which the person will be operating the employer's vehicles; and\n\n(c) the notarized signature of the person's employer.\n\n(3) This subsection does not apply to:\n\n(a) a person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, unless the person's driving privileges have been suspended for not less than one year or the person has had an ignition interlock device installed for not less than one year on each of the motor vehicles owned or operated, or both, by the person;\n\n(b) a person who is self-employed or to a person who is employed by a business owned in whole or in part by the person or a member of the person's household or immediate family unless during the defense of a criminal charge, the court finds that the vehicle's ownership by the business serves a legitimate business purpose and that titling and registration of the vehicle by the business was not done to circumvent the intent of this section; or\n\n(c) a person participating in the Ignition Interlock Device Program as an habitual offender as provided for in Section 56-1-1090(A).\n\n(4) Whenever the person operates the employer's vehicle pursuant to this subsection, the person shall have with the person a copy of the form specified by this subsection.\n\n(5) The determination of eligibility for the waiver is subject to periodic review at the discretion of the department. The department shall revoke a waiver issued pursuant to this exemption if the department determines that the person has been driving a vehicle other than the vehicle owned by the person's employer or has been operating the person's employer's vehicle outside the locations, days, or hours specified by the employer in the department's records. The person may seek relief from the department's determination by filing a request for a contested case hearing with the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act and the rules of procedure for the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings.\n\n(H) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person to obtain an ignition interlock device unless one or more of the offenses that resulted in the suspension were alcohol related.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-186; 1952 Code Sections 46-179, 46-349; 1942 Code Section 5996; 1932 Code Section 5996; 1930 (36) 1057; 1949 (46) 466; 1955 (49) 177; 1959 (51) 421; 1965 (54) 461; 1984 Act No. 478, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1318; 1996 Act No. 459, Section 91; 2007 Act No. 103, Section 23.B, eff January 1, 2008; 2008 Act No. 285, Section 2, eff January 1, 2009; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 3, eff October 1, 2014; 2015 Act No. 34 (S.590), Section 1, eff June 1, 2015; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Section 20, eff July 1, 2016; 2023 Act No. 55 (S.36), Section 3, eff May 19, 2024.",

No portion of a term of imprisonment or confinement under home detention may be suspended by the trial judge except when the court is suspending a term of imprisonment upon successful completion of the terms and conditions of confinement under home detention. For purposes of this item, a person sentenced to confinement pursuant to the Home Detention Act is required to pay for the cost of such confinement.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 22-3-540, 22-3-545, 22-3-550, and 14-25-65, an offense punishable under this item may be tried in magistrates or municipal court.\n\n(e)(i) A person convicted of a first or second offense of this item, as determined by the records of the department, and who is employed or enrolled in a college or university at any time while the person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to this item, may apply for a route restricted driver's license permitting the person to drive only to and from work or the person's place of education and in the course of the person's employment or education during the period of suspension. The department may issue the route restricted driver's license only upon a showing by the person that the person is employed or enrolled in a college or university and that the person lives further than one mile from the person's place of employment or place of education.\n\n(ii) When the department issues a route restricted driver's license, it shall designate reasonable restrictions on the times during which and routes on which the person may operate a motor vehicle. A person holding a route restricted driver's license pursuant to this item shall report to the department immediately any change in the person's employment hours, place of employment, status as a student, or residence.\n\n(iii) The fee for a route restricted driver's license issued pursuant to this item is one hundred dollars, but no additional fee is due when changes occur in the place and hours of employment, education, or residence. Of this fee, eighty dollars must be placed by the Comptroller General into the State Highway Fund as established by Section 57-11-20, to be distributed as provided in Section 11-43-167. The remainder of the fees collected pursuant to this item must be credited to the Department of Transportation State Non-Federal Aid Highway Fund.\n\n(iv) The operation of a motor vehicle outside the time limits and route imposed by a route-restricted license is a violation of subsection (A)(1).\n\n(2) A person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State when the person's license has been suspended or revoked pursuant to the provisions of Section 56-5-2990 or 56-5-2945 must, upon conviction, be punished as follows:\n\n(a) for a first offense, fined three hundred dollars or imprisoned for not less than ten nor more than thirty days;\n\n(b) for a second offense, fined six hundred dollars or imprisoned for not less than sixty days nor more than six months;\n\n(c) for a third or subsequent offense, fined one thousand dollars and imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than three years.\n\nNo portion of the minimum sentence imposed pursuant to this item may be suspended.\n\n(B) The Department of Motor Vehicles, upon receiving a record of a person's conviction pursuant to this section upon a charge of driving a vehicle while the person's license was suspended for a definite period of time, shall extend the suspension period for an additional like period. If the original period of suspension has expired or terminated before trial and conviction, the department shall again suspend the person's license for an additional like period of time.

If the license of a person cited for a violation of this section is suspended solely pursuant to the provisions of Section 56-25-20, the additional period of suspension pursuant to this section is thirty days, and the person does not have to offer proof of financial responsibility as required pursuant to Section 56-9-500 prior to the person's license being reinstated. If the conviction was for a charge of driving while a license was revoked, the department shall not issue a new license for an additional period of one year from the date the person could otherwise have applied for a new license. Only those violations which occurred within a period of five years including and immediately preceding the date of the last violation constitute prior violations within the meaning of this section.\n\n(C) One hundred dollars of each fine imposed pursuant to this section must be placed by the Comptroller General into a special restricted account to be used by the Department of Public Safety for the Highway Patrol.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 46-192.1; 1952 Code Section 46-351; 1949 (46) 466; 1956 (49) 1687; 1959 (51) 421; 1967 (55) 201; 1973 (58) 199; 1987 Act No. 84 Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1321; 1996 Act No; 459, Section 94; 2000 Act No. 376, Section 1; 2002 Act No. 263, Section 1; 2004 Act No. 176, Section 2; 2010 Act No. 273, Section 18.A, eff January 2, 2011; 2014 Act No. 158 (S.137), Section 4, eff October 1, 2014; 2016 Act No. 275 (S.1258), Section 21, eff July 1, 2016.",
