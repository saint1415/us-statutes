The General Assembly also finds that outdoor advertising is an integral part of the business and marketing function and is an established segment of the national economy which serves to promote and protect investments in commerce and industry and is, therefore, a business which must be allowed to exist and operate where other business and commercial activities are conducted and that a reasonable use of property for outdoor advertising to the traveling public is desirable. In order, however, to prevent unreasonable distraction of operators of motor vehicles, prevent confusion with regard to traffic lights, signs, or signals, prevent interference with the effectiveness of traffic regulations, promote the prosperity, economic well-being, and general welfare of the State, mitigate the adverse secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses and limit harm to minors, promote the safety, convenience, and enjoyment of travel on and protection of the public investment in highways within this State, and preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty or aesthetic features of the highways and adjacent areas, the General Assembly declares it to be the policy of this State that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the rights-of-way of the interstate and federal-aid primary systems within this State must be regulated in accordance with the terms of this article which provide for standards consistent with customary use in this State and finds that all outdoor advertising devices which do not conform to the requirements of this article are illegal.

(9) signs of thirty-two square feet or less advertising agricultural products of a seasonal nature, signs of a political nature, signs erected by or on the behalf of eleemosynary, civic, nonprofit, church, or charitable organizations, or signs advertising special community events which are erected temporarily for ninety days or less. (B) Signs are not permitted in any of the above categories which imitate or resemble an official traffic sign, signal, or device, are erected or maintained upon trees, are printed or drawn upon rocks or other natural features, or are in disrepair. (C) The size of a sign permitted under items (7) and (8) of subsection (A) must not be more than six hundred seventy-two square feet in area, sixty feet in length, or forty-eight feet in height. All dimensions include border and trim but exclude decorative bases and supports. Cutouts and extensions are in addition to this amount but may not increase the height of a sign to more than forty-eight feet and may not increase the size of a sign facing by more than one hundred fifty square feet. No more than two sign panels facing in the same direction may be erected on the same sign structure if the total area of both sign panels does not exceed the maximum. The maximum size limitation applies to each sign facing. (D) No sign permitted under this section may obscure or otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, signal, or device nor obstruct or interfere with the driver's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic. No sign except on premises and FOR SALE or LEASE signs may be located within three hundred feet of any of the following which are adjacent to the highway in areas outside of incorporated municipalities or within one hundred feet on sections inside municipalities: (1) public parks of ten acres or more; (2) public forests; (3) public playgrounds of one-half acre or more; (4) scenic areas designated by the commission or other state agency having and exercising that authority. (E) No sign structure permitted under items (7) and (8) of subsection (A) on the interstate system or on a federal-aid primary route, constructed to controlled access standards, may be erected within five hundred feet of another sign structure on the same side of the highway. No sign may be located on the interstate system or controlled access federal-aid primary route adjacent to or within five hundred feet of an interchange or a rest area measured along the interstate or controlled access primary highways from the nearest point of the beginning or ending of pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the main-traveled way. The distance from an interchange or a rest area set forth in this subsection does not apply to sites adjacent to highways that are within the boundaries of an incorporated municipality. No sign structure permitted under items (7) and (8) of subsection (A) on a noncontrolled access federal-aid primary route outside of an incorporated municipality may be erected within three hundred feet of another sign structure on the same side of the highway. No sign structure located adjacent to a noncontrolled access federal-aid primary route may be erected within a distance of one hundred feet of another sign structure inside an incorporated municipality on the same side of the highway. This subsection does not apply to advertising displays which are separated by a building or other obstruction so that only one display located within the minimum spacing distance is visible from any point on the highway at any one time. (F) No sign permitted under items (7) and (8) of subsection (A) may contain, include, or be illuminated by a flashing, intermittent, or moving light, except those giving public service information such as time, date, temperature, weather, or other similar information. No sign permitted under this section may be erected or maintained which is not shielded effectively so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at a portion of the main-traveled way of an interstate or federal-aid primary route and which is of an intensity or brilliance so as to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle or which otherwise may interfere with a driver's operation of a motor vehicle. No sign may be illuminated so that it interferes with the effectiveness of or obscures an official traffic sign, device, or signal. (G) The standards contained in this section pertaining to size, shape, description, lighting, and spacing of outdoor advertising signs permitted in zoned and unzoned commercial and industrial areas do not apply to signs lawfully in place on this article's effective date. Signs lawfully in place on November 3, 1971, or erected within six months after that date under a lease dated and recorded before that date are exempted from the standards requirement. (H) Whenever a bona fide county or local zoning authority has made a determination of customary use, which includes a regulation of size, lighting, and spacing of outdoor advertising signs, in zoned industrial or commercial areas, the determination prevails over the size, lighting, and spacing otherwise provided for the signs in subsections (C) and (E) if all of the following exist: (1) The standards imposed on size, lighting, and spacing are at least as restrictive as the standards set forth in subsections (C), (D), (E), and (F). (2) The zoning plan provides for effective enforcement by the zoning authority of the imposed restrictions. (3) The zoning plan and amendments are submitted to and approved by the Department of Transportation before they prevail over the standards set forth in this section. Zoning which controls contiguous tracts which comprise less than twenty percent of the land within a political subdivision or land which is zoned primarily to permit outdoor advertising signs is not considered zoning for the purposes of this section. (I)(1) No person may cut, trim, or otherwise cause to be removed vegetation from within the limits of highway rights-of-way unless permitted to do so by the department. Permits to remove vegetation may be granted only for sign locations which have been permitted at least two years and then only at the sole discretion of the department. (2) If vegetation is removed from within a highway right-of-way without a permit by the sign owner or his agent and the removal has the effect of enhancing the visibility of the outdoor advertising sign, the sign is illegal and must be removed at the responsible party's expense. Upon a violation of this subsection the responsible party is not eligible for a sign permit: (a) for one year: first violation; (b) for five years: second violation; (c) permanently: third and subsequent violations. (3) The department must be reimbursed for cleaning or replanting at the site of the illegal cutting by the responsible party. Until the expenses are reimbursed, the responsible party must not be issued a sign permit. (J) Signs permitted under items (1), (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (A) must comply with the regulations promulgated by the commission in accordance with uniform national standards.

The commission also shall promulgate regulations governing the issuance of the permits and standards for size, spacing, and lighting of the signs and their messages. (B) The Department of Transportation shall issue permits for all signs on location on November 3, 1971, except those signs erected pursuant to items (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of subsection (A) of Section 57-25-140. It also shall issue permits for the erection and maintenance of additional outdoor advertising signs coming within the exceptions contained within items (4), (7), and (8) of subsection (A) of Section 57-25-140. Sign owners must be assessed the following fees: (1) the appropriate annual fee plus an initial nonrefundable permit application fee of one hundred dollars, except that the nonrefundable permit application fee shall be waived for South Carolina farmers advertising agricultural products produced on land that they farm which are for sale to the public and if the signs do not exceed thirty-two square feet; (2) an annual fee of twenty dollars if the advertising area does not exceed three hundred fifty square feet; and (3) an annual fee of thirty dollars if the advertising area exceeds three hundred fifty square feet. The permit fees must be allocated first for administrative costs incurred by the department in maintaining the outdoor advertising program. The permit number must be displayed prominently on the sign. (C) Permits are for the calendar year, must be assigned a permanent number, and must be renewed annually upon payment of the fee for the new year without the filing of a new application. Fees must not be prorated for a portion of the year. Only one permit is required for a double-faced, back-to-back, or V-type sign. Advertising copy may be changed without the payment of an additional fee. No permit is required before January 1, 1973. Failure to pay a renewal fee within ninety days of the date of the first bill for the fee cancels the permit and makes the sign illegal. (D) The commission shall promulgate regulations governing the issuance of permits which must include mandatory maintenance to ensure that all signs are always in a good state of repair. Signs not in a good state of repair are illegal. (E) The cost of permits or their renewals required under the provisions of this article are in addition to ad valorem taxes. (F) No permit application may be approved without written permission of the owner or other person in lawful possession of the site designated as the location of the sign in the application. (G) Permits for the following signs are void: (1) a conforming sign that is removed voluntarily for more than thirty days; and (2) a nonconforming sign that is removed voluntarily by the owner. (H) Permits shall be maintained for nonconforming signs structurally damaged by vandalism, and: (1) those signs may only be restored in kind; (2) restoration may begin not earlier than ten business days after the department has received notice of the vandalism from the sign owner, but must begin no later than one hundred eighty days after the department has received the report of vandalism pursuant to subsection (H)(3); and (3) restoration shall not begin until a report of the vandalism incident has been made by the appropriate law enforcement authority and the report has been received by the department. (I)(1) National Historic Landmark Section 501(C)(3) properties located along South Carolina highways and properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the Department of the Interior which are located along South Carolina highways are allowed to erect small directional signs no more frequently than one a mile within six miles of such properties.

      "text": "(A) An outdoor advertising sign which violates the provisions of this article is illegal and the Department of Transportation shall give thirty days' notice by certified or registered mail to the owner of the advertising sign and to the owner of the property on which the sign is located for its removal. However, a sign lawfully in existence along the interstate system or the federal-aid primary system on November 3, 1971, or which was lawfully erected after that date, which is not in conformity with the provisions contained in this article, is not required to be removed until just compensation has been paid for it. Except as provided in Section 57-25-160, no sign otherwise required to be removed under this article for which just compensation is authorized to be paid by the department is required to be removed if the federal share of at least seventy-five percent of the just compensation to be paid upon its removal is not available for the payment. Nothing in this section prevents the removal of nonconforming signs for which no federal share is payable in those instances where no compensation has to be paid. (B) Employees or agents of the department may go upon the property upon which an illegal sign is located after expiration of the thirty-day period for the purpose of its removal. The period of the notice must be computed from the date of mailing. No notice, however, is required to be given to the owner of an advertising sign for which a permit has not been obtained. The moving of an illegal sign from one location to another without a permit having been obtained for the illegal sign does not require the department to provide additional notice to the sign owner before removing the sign, even if the sign is moved from the property of one owner to the property of another. (C) When the department removes an illegal sign, it must be reimbursed the removal expenses by the sign owner. The sign must be maintained in the possession of the department for no more than thirty days during which the sign may be claimed by the owner upon payment of the expenses. If the sign is not claimed during the thirty days, it is declared abandoned, becomes the property of the department, and may be disposed of through sale or in any other manner which the department considers appropriate. Even if the owner does not recover the sign, he remains liable to the department for the expenses incurred in removing and storing the sign. Until the expenses are reimbursed, the sign owner must not be issued a permit for an outdoor advertising sign from the department. (D) Review of the department's determination that a sign is illegal is through an administrative hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act. Written request for the review must be received by the department within the thirty-day period.

(2) Alteration or relocation costs, as determined by the South Carolina Department of Transportation Relocation Assistance Manual, for an outdoor advertising sign whose property interests in the sign are acquired by a local highway project pursuant to this section shall be paid by the political subdivision that is responsible for the local highway project, pursuant to the following conditions: (a) If the owner of an outdoor advertising sign whose property interests in the sign are acquired by a local highway project cannot relocate or alter the sign as permitted in this section despite the owner's best efforts to do so, then the political subdivision requiring the outdoor advertising sign's removal shall compensate the owner. (b) Compensation paid by the political subdivision requiring an outdoor advertising sign's removal shall be paid pursuant to Section 39-14-10, et seq.

(ii) If the relocated site meets federal and state laws, the relocation will be allowed under the existing permit and no new local zoning or state permit will be required; provided, that the relocated site is within the same county as the original sign site.
