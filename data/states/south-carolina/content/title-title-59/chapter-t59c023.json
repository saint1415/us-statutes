(B) The provisions of this section apply to all middle school stadiums and high school stadiums built or renovated after the effective date of this act and all middle school stadiums and high school stadiums in existence or in the process of being planned, constructed, or renovated on the effective date of this act. However, a stadium that is being renovated but is not replacing existing seating or adding new seating may not be required to add water closets or lavatories to conform to the provisions of this section or any other applicable building code, plumbing code, school building regulations, or another provision of law. For a stadium that is being renovated to replace existing or add new seating, the plumbing fixtures requirements apply only to the number of new seats being added or replaced. (C) To determine the occupant load of each sex, the total occupant load must be divided in half. To determine the required number of fixtures, the fixture ratio or ratios for each fixture type must be applied to the occupant load of each sex in accordance with subsection (A). Fractional numbers resulting from applying the fixture ratios must be rounded up to the next whole number. For calculations involving multiple occupancies, such fractional numbers for each occupancy first must be summed and then rounded up to the next whole number. However, the total occupant load must not be required to be divided in half where approved statistical data indicates a distribution of the sexes of other than fifty percent of each sex.
