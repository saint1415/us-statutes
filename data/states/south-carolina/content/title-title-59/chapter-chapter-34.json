While braille is not required, it is presumed that the need for braille reading and writing are valuable skills to be considered in the student's transition plan toward continuing in higher education and in broadening job and career opportunities.\n\nNo child who is legally blind may be denied the opportunity to receive instructions in braille reading and writing on the basis that the child has the ability to read and write print.\n\nEach student must be given an assessment which must include an evaluation of the need for braille skills to be designed by the State Department of Education, and shall include strengths and deficits. The purpose of the assessment is to determine the most appropriate reading and writing media for the individual child and does not require the use of braille if other special education services are appropriate.\n\nNothing in this section requires the inclusion of braille in a legally blind student's IEP.\n\nHISTORY: 1992 Act No. 282, Section 2.",
