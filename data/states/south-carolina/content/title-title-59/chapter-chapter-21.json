These funds must be used (i) for the renovation, capital improvement, or repair of school classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and other instructional facilities, including music rooms, or (ii) to reduce the millage required to pay principal and interest on bonds issued for such purposes if the district qualifies for the exception provided for in subsection (b) hereof.\n\n(b) If a school district has issued bonds or otherwise undertaken any capital improvement programs during any of the most recent five fiscal years, at least fifty percent of the funds provided in subsection (a) must be used to reduce the millage required to pay debt service on such outstanding bonds.\n\nProvided however, in the event that a school district sold bonds or secured a loan at an interest rate less than prevailing rates and has an identified need for funds in excess of fifty percent of funds provided in subsection (a) or anticipates a significant increase in need for additional classroom space, that district may request a waiver from this requirement by the State Board of Education. After consultation with the State Treasurer on prevailing interest rates and review of the evidence accompanying the waiver request from the school district, and upon certification by the State Treasurer that rates are beneficial to local school district, the State Board of Education may grant a waiver if the evidence is substantiated. The remaining sums may be used either to reduce millage to pay debt service or to pay for capital improvements, repairs, or renovations otherwise authorized during the then current fiscal year. Provided, Further, That if, on the occasion when the annual millage would otherwise be increased to provide for capital improvements, repairs, or renovations, there is on hand with the country treasurer sums from the appropriation herein authorized, sufficient to meet all or a portion of the payments of principal and interest on bonds to be outstanding in the ensuing fiscal year, then such portion of the millage required to pay such debt service need not be imposed.\n\n(c) A capital improvement program for purposes of this section is defined as incurring debt for school building purposes or levying and collecting school taxes for school building purposes over the district's last five fiscal years averaged at least one-half the amount the district is entitled to receive during state Fiscal Year 1985 as provided in subsection (a) hereof. If the district has fiscal autonomy to any degree, it shall provide for the manner in which the school millage must be reduced. If the district does not have fiscal autonomy, the governing body of the county wherein the district is located shall provide for the manner in which the school millage must be reduced.\n\n(d) The funds authorized herein for reduction in millage for debt service may not be expended in conjunction with the authorization of bonds that increase a school district's bonded indebtedness above the limit provided for in Article X of the South Carolina Constitution or expended to pay debt service on bond anticipation notes authorized which would put the total bonded indebtedness of the school district (general obligation and bond anticipation) above the constitutionally mandated limit.\n\nHISTORY: 1984 Act No. 512, Part II, Section 9, Division II, Subdivision G, SubPart 1, Section 1.",

Beginning in 1985-86, local financial effort for noncapital programs must be adjusted for an inflation factor estimated by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.\n\nThereafter, school district boards of trustees or other governing bodies of school districts shall maintain at least the level of financial effort per pupil for noncapital programs as in the prior year adjusted for an inflation factor estimated by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The county auditor shall establish a millage rate so that the level of financial effort per pupil for noncapital programs adjusted for an inflation factor estimated by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office is maintained as a minimum effort. No school district which has not complied with this section may receive funds from the South Carolina Education Improvement Act of 1984 Fund. School district boards of trustees may apply for a waiver to the State Board of Education from the requirements of this section if:\n\n(1) the district has experienced a loss in revenue because of reduction in assessed valuation of property or has had a significant increase in one hundred thirty-five average daily membership;\n\n(2) the district has experienced insignificant growth in revenue collections from the previous year;\n\n(3) the district has demonstrated for one year that it has achieved operating efficiencies and all education requirements are being met;\n\n(4) a midyear revenue shortfall results in a reduction of funds appropriated in accordance with Chapter 20 of Title 59 (The Education Finance Act). A decline in the measured academic achievement of the students must immediately cause the State Board of Education to void all waivers provided under this section and make the district ineligible to apply for any waivers under this section for two consecutive years. If the decline in student achievement occurs, the district shall revert to the minimum effort requirement, adjusted for the prior years inflation factor. Waiver (4) does not apply to funds needed to meet the Minimum Salary Schedule for teachers in South Carolina. A school district is eligible for an annual renewal of the waiver provided the district meets one of the above criteria and meets the minimum effort requirement of the previous year and at least the minimum required effort of the Education Finance Act.\n\nHISTORY: 1990 Act No. 612, Section 74C.",

The advisory committee must be appointed, after receiving nominations, as set forth in this item, and consists of six at-large members, three appointed by the Governor and three appointed by the State Superintendent of Education, and the following members appointed by the State Board of Education:\n\none school board member;\n\ntwo elementary teachers;\n\ntwo middle or junior high school teachers;\n\ntwo secondary school teachers;\n\none elementary school principal;\n\none middle or junior high school principal;\n\none secondary school principal;\n\none district superintendent;\n\none guidance counselor;\n\none assistant principal; and\n\none teacher's aide.\n\nThe State Board of Education shall request:\n\n(a) each statewide professional teacher organization to nominate at least two qualified continuing contract teachers for each teacher position on the committee;\n\n(b) a statewide organization representing administrators (principals and superintendents) to nominate at least two qualified candidates for the administrator positions on the committee;\n\n(c) a statewide organization to nominate at least two qualified candidates for the guidance counselor position on the committee;\n\n(d) a statewide organization representing school boards to nominate at least two qualified candidates for the school board position on the committee.\n\nEach nominating organization shall seek qualified candidates from the entire pool of persons eligible to serve and shall make nominations to the state board based on merit and without regard to membership in the nominating organization.\n\nIt is the intent of the General Assembly that funds for the campus incentive program must be distributed to districts on a per pupil basis but with a minimum amount per faculty member in schools qualifying for the program reward; however, the advisory committee may recommend an alternative distribution method. The per pupil allocation must be based on the one hundred thirty-five day count of average daily membership for the preceding fiscal year.\n\nThe State Board of Education, in consultation with the Education Oversight Committee, shall develop regulations to ensure that the campus incentive funds are used in an appropriate manner and to establish a procedure for redistributing funds from districts that do not require all of their allocations. The General Assembly shall determine each year in the general appropriations act the amount of campus incentive funds which must be included in the calculation of the South Carolina average teacher salary.\n\nTo enable school faculties to undertake needed work in the area of school improvement and planning, and such activities as research, curriculum development, coordination of courses, and special projects, or other activities the faculty may wish to undertake for improving student performance, development, and learning and coordination of services with other social and health agencies, the General Assembly shall set aside in the annual general appropriations act other campus incentive funds which must be used by the school districts and any interested schools to compensate faculty for their time and effort. The State Board of Education shall promulgate guidelines that ensure that the districts of the State utilize these funds in an appropriate manner and to establish a procedure for redistributing funds from districts that do not require all of their allocation.\n\nHISTORY: 1991 Act No. 171, Part II, Section 59A; 1998 Act No. 400, Section 15.",
