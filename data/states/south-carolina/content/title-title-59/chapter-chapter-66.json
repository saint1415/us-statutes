      "text": "(A) The General Assembly annually shall provide funds in the general appropriations act to be awarded to school districts which choose to employ safety coordinators in accordance with this section. State funds may be awarded for not more than one safety coordinator for each county. The amount of the award for a county for fiscal year 1995-96 may not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, except for counties which are designated as economically distressed pursuant to Section 41-43-180. Economically distressed counties participating in the program shall receive additional state funds for fiscal year 1995-96 in the amount of five thousand five hundred dollars. The amount which may be awarded for a county, including the additional state funds for economically distressed counties, must be increased each fiscal year after 1995-96 by the same percentage as the average teacher salary.\n\n(B) An award of state funds to school districts under this program is contingent upon a district or group of districts jointly matching the state grant with an equal amount of funds and in-kind contributions; however, school districts located primarily within an economically distressed county are not required to match any portion of the state grant. Additionally, funds only may be awarded where the duties of the safety coordinator relate exclusively to school and district safety functions. It is the intent of the General Assembly that the safety coordinator have a strong background in law enforcement, safety matters, or coordination of relevant services.\n\n(C) If a county consists of more than one school district, any or all school districts within the county may apply jointly for funds for a safety coordinator. Each participating school district must provide a portion of the local matching funds based upon the relationship the district's student membership bears to the total student membership of all participating districts within the county. Nonparticipating school districts in multi-district counties may begin participation in the program by contributing to the local match in the same manner as those school districts originally participating in the program.\n\n(D) When more than one school district in a multi-district county is provided funds under this section, the safety coordinator must be an employee of the school district with the largest student membership during the immediately preceding school year, unless the participating school districts have a memorandum of agreement providing otherwise; however, the safety coordinator must provide services to all participating school districts.\n\n(E) For purposes of this section, \"student membership\" means the cumulative one hundred thirty-five day average daily membership during the immediately preceding school year.\n\n(F) The State Board of Education, through the State Department of Education, shall develop and implement regulations establishing the safety coordinator grant program.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 7, Part IV, Section 67.",
