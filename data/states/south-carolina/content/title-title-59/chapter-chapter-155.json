These interventions must be based in the science of reading, be at least thirty minutes daily, and be in addition to the minimum of ninety minutes of daily reading and writing instruction provided to all students in kindergarten through second grade. The delivery of additional supports and interventions shall not result in a student losing access to regular instruction in subject areas identified in the defined program for grades K-5 as established by the board. The district must continue to provide intensive interventions until the student is meeting grade-level reading proficiency.\n\n(2) To ensure early interventions, districts are encouraged to retain students in kindergarten through second grade who are not demonstrating grade-level reading proficiency. In making retention decisions, districts shall seek recommendations from the student's teacher(s) and principal.\n\n(F) For students in grades four and above who are not demonstrating reading proficiency shall be provided additional reading interventions which may include services from a reading interventionist in the classroom or supplementally by teachers with a literacy teacher endorsement or reading/literacy coaches. This supplemental support will be provided during the school day and, as appropriate, before or after school, as documented in the district reading plan, and may include high dose low ratio tutoring or mentoring as prescribed by the department, or in summer reading camps.\n\n(G) Students eligible for retention pursuant to this section shall enroll in a summer reading camp provided by their district or a summer reading camp consortium to which their districts belong prior to being retained the following school year. Summer reading camps must be at least the equivalent of ninety-six hours of instruction. The camps must be taught by compensated teachers who have at least a literacy endorsement or who have documented and demonstrated substantial success in helping students achieve proficiency of grade-level reading standards. The department shall assist districts that cannot find qualified teachers to work in the summer camps. Districts may choose to contract for the services of qualified instructors or collaborate with one or more districts to provide a summer reading camp. Schools and districts are encouraged to partner with county or school libraries, institutions of higher learning, community organizations, faith-based institutions, businesses, pediatric and family practice medical personnel, and other groups to provide volunteers, mentors, tutors, space, or other support to assist with the provision of the summer reading camps. A parent or guardian of a student who does not demonstrate reading proficiency for his grade level shall make the final decision regarding the student's participation in the summer reading camp.\n\n(H) A district shall include in the summer reading camps first and second grade students who are not exhibiting grade-level reading proficiency. This shall be implemented beginning with the 2025-2026 School Year by including first grade students not exhibiting grade-level reading proficiency and beginning with the 2026-2027 School Year by including second grade students not demonstrating grade-level reading proficiency. Students at any other grade who are not exhibiting reading proficiency may be included in summer reading camps at the discretion of the district. Districts may charge fees for these students to attend the summer reading camps based on a sliding scale pursuant to Section 59-19-90, except where a child is found to be reading below grade level in the first through third grade and does not meet the good cause exemption.\n\nHISTORY: 2014 Act No. 284 (S.516), Section 1, eff June 11, 2014; 2024 Act No. 114 (S.418), Section 7, eff March 11, 2024.",

All teacher preparation programs must be approved for licensure by the State Department of Education to ensure that all teacher education candidates possess the knowledge and skills to assist effectively all children in becoming proficient readers. The General Assembly is not mandating an increase in the number of credit hours required for teacher candidates, but is requiring that pre-service teacher education programs prioritize their missions and resources so all early and elementary education teachers have the knowledge and skills to provide effective instruction in reading and numeracy to all students.\n\n(2) Beginning with students entering a teacher education program in the fall semester of the 2016-2017 School Year, all pre-service teacher education programs, including MAT degree programs, must require all candidates seeking certification at the middle or secondary level to complete a six credit hour sequence in literacy that includes a course in the foundations of literacy and a course in content-area reading. All middle and secondary teacher preparation programs must be approved by the department to ensure that all teacher candidates possess the necessary knowledge and skills to assist effectively all adolescents in becoming proficient readers. The General Assembly is not mandating an increase in the number of semester hours required for teacher candidates but rather is requiring that pre-service teacher education programs prioritize their mission and resources so all middle and secondary education teachers have the knowledge and skills to provide effective instruction in reading and numeracy to all students.\n\n(C)(1) To ensure that practicing professionals possess the knowledge and skills necessary to assist all children in becoming proficient readers, multiple pathways are needed for developing this capacity.\n\n(2) A reading/literacy coach shall be employed in each elementary school. Reading coaches shall serve as job-embedded, stable resources for professional development throughout schools in order to generate improvement in reading and literacy instruction and student achievement. Reading coaches shall support and provide initial and ongoing professional development to teachers based on an analysis of student assessment and the provision of differentiated instruction and intensive intervention. The reading coach shall:\n\n(a) model effective instructional strategies for teachers by working weekly with students in whole, and small groups, or individually;\n\n(b) facilitate study groups;\n\n(c) train teachers in data analysis and using data to differentiate instruction;\n\n(d) coaching and mentoring colleagues;\n\n(e) work with teachers to ensure that scientifically based reading programs are implemented with fidelity;\n\n(f) work with all teachers (including content area and elective areas) at the school they serve, and help prioritize time for those teachers, activities, and roles that will have the greatest impact on student achievement, namely coaching and mentoring in the classrooms; and\n\n(g) help lead and support reading leadership teams.\n\n(3) The reading coach must not be assigned a regular classroom teaching assignment, must not perform administrative functions that deter from the flow of improving reading instruction and reading performance of students and must not devote a significant portion of his or her time to administering or coordinating assessments. The department must publish guidelines that define the minimum qualifications for a reading coach. Districts must provide to the department information on the name and qualifications of reading coaches funded by the state appropriations.\n\n(4) The board is authorized to approve guidelines on an annual basis for professional development, coursework, certification, and endorsement requirements for teachers of early childhood and elementary education, including special education teachers, interventionists, reading specialists, and administrators, whose responsibilities, either directly or indirectly, substantially relate to reading and literacy instruction, support, or interventions as provided in this section. The guidelines approved by the board shall also include the issuance of appropriate credit to individuals who have completed a department-approved intensive and prolonged professional development program. Local school districts, working with the department, shall offer the required professional development, coursework, certification, and endorsements at no charge to teachers. In-service hours earned through professional development must be used for renewal of teaching certificates in all subject areas.\n\n(5) Beginning September 1, 2026, early childhood, elementary, and special education teacher candidates seeking their initial certification in South Carolina must earn a passing score on a rigorous test of scientifically based reading instruction and intervention and data-based decision making principles as approved by the board. The objective of this item is to ensure that teacher candidates understand the foundations of reading and are prepared to teach reading to all students.\n\n(6) The board shall approve guidelines and procedures to allow in-service teachers the option of utilizing the test in item (5) to exempt requirements established by the board pursuant to item (4). As part of this process, the board shall set a minimum cut score for an in-service teacher to achieve to take advantage of this provision. A teacher's score on this assessment may not be used for evaluation purposes. Contingent upon funding by the General Assembly, this test shall be provided at no cost to the teacher.\n\n(7) Teachers, administrators, and other certified faculty and staff are exempt from having to earn the literacy endorsement to maintain certification only if they are not educating or serving students in a school or other educational setting. The literacy endorsement must be earned before an individual who was previously exempt pursuant to this item returns to a position where they educate or otherwise serve students.\n\n(8) Annually by August first, the department shall publish guidelines and procedures used in evaluating all courses offered to teachers, including virtual courses and professional development, leading to the literacy endorsement. The department shall publish the approved courses and professional development leading to the literacy endorsement no later than January first, annually.\n\n(9) Prior to August 1, 2026, and continuing every five years thereafter, the department will conduct an evaluation of approved courses used for compliance of this section. The evaluation should include survey data from prior course participants. The department shall remove any courses receiving an unsatisfactory evaluation from the list of approved courses and professional development under this section.\n\nHISTORY: 2014 Act No. 284 (S.516), Section 1, eff June 11, 2014; 2024 Act No. 114 (S.418), Section 9, eff March 11, 2024.",
