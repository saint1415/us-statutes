In addition, the State Treasurer may direct the county treasurer to apply to the payment due on the bonds any monies being held by the county treasurer in any fund, other than the sinking fund, derived from state revenue for the operating school unit.\n\n(C) The amounts forwarded to any county treasurer by the State Treasurer under subsection (B) must be applied by the county treasurer or paying agent solely to the payment of the principal of or interest on the bonds. The State Treasurer shall notify the State Department of Education, the county auditor, and the superintendent of the operating school unit of payments made and sums withheld pursuant to this section.\n\n(D) Whenever the State Treasurer makes a payment to a county treasurer pursuant to subsection (B) and withholds sums from revenue to the operating school unit pursuant to this section, or directs a county treasurer to apply monies for this purpose, the county treasurer shall pay to the operating school unit all collections of property taxes levied for the payment of the operating school unit's general obligation bonds until the sums so withheld or applied have been paid by the county treasurer to the operating school unit from such tax levies.\n\n(E) A county auditor in any county in which the provisions of subsection (B) have been implemented for the payment of principal and interest on the general obligation bonds of an operating school unit shall adjust the millage levied for the payment of those bonds in the next fiscal year to the level necessary to provide for the punctual payment of all sums due during that year and shall file a report with the State Treasurer demonstrating compliance with this subsection not later than five business days after setting the millage for this fiscal year.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 155, Part II, Section 65.",
