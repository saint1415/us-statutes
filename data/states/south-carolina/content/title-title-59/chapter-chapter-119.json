In the discretion of the trustees, in lieu of cash, the debt service reserve fund may be funded with a surety bond, insurance policy, letter of credit, line of credit, or similar guarantee. At the discretion of the trustees, Clemson may purchase an insurance policy insuring payment of both principal and interest on any issuance of bonds under the provisions of this article;\n\n(20) appoint a corporate trustee, who may be the State Treasurer, or paying agent to whom must be paid all or any portion of the revenues or net revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds or derived from the operation of the facilities, and to prescribe the manner in which these revenues or net revenues must be utilized and disposed of. The corporate trustee shall serve in a fiduciary capacity as trustee for the bondholders under the resolutions of the trustees authorizing the issuance of bonds.\n\nHISTORY: 1990 Act No. 502, Section 1.",

Clemson University has demonstrated need for additional funds to provide for acquisition, construction, renovation, and equipping of such facilities. These facilities are needed to replace or renovate aging facilities and to provide additional facilities all to the end that the educational environment at Clemson University will be enhanced for the benefit of present and future students at Clemson University.\n\n(B) Consideration has been given to this need and to the methods of funding it. It has been determined to be in the best interests of the people of this State to authorize Clemson University to acquire, construct, renovate, and equip additional such facilities and to incur indebtedness for these purposes which is payable from the revenues derived from the operation of these facilities and from related fees to the extent and under the conditions provided for in this article.\n\n(C) Heretofore, pursuant to Acts 466 of 1957, 905 of 1960, 1277 of 1970, 1653 of 1972, 1303 of 1974, 760 of 1976, and 193 and 194 of 1983, the General Assembly has previously made provision for the issuance of revenue bonds of Clemson University for the purpose of financing and refinancing improvements to the football stadium on the campus of Clemson University known as Memorial Stadium. By this article, the General Assembly intends to amend and restate these acts for the purpose of broadening the scope of athletic facilities on the campus of Clemson University which may be financed or refinanced from the proceeds of bonds which are payable from revenues of the athletic department of Clemson University and related fees.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 144, Section 1.",
