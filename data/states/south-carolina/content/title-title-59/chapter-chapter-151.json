Occasional and incidental use of the network by persons appropriately granted access to the network for purposes that are not directly related to the missions of the participating academic institutions is not considered a violation of this subsection.\n\n(C) Private organizations and entities may be provided access to the network only through formal documented partnerships with one or more of the South Carolina academic institutions that are members of the South Carolina LightRail Consortium that are directly related to the missions of the partnering institutions. This access must be consistent with guidelines and procedures approved by the consortium board.
