However, where the parent, guardian, or other responsible party shall oppose the recommendation of the agency administering the residential program to return the individual to his home, the agency, based upon professional judgment, may place the individual in other nonresidential programs such as foster homes, community residences, halfway residences, or other similar services designed to promote the growth and development of the handicapped individual.

The licensed professional's certification must include the date of the examination, the basis for the determination, and whether the student's incapability of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences with respect to his educational program is likely to last until after age twenty-one. The licensed professional's certification must remain in effect during the period the student receives educational services as an adult, regardless of whether the student transfers to another school or local education agency, if the student's subsequent local education agency is promptly provided with the documentation that the prior local education agency relied on in allowing an educational representative to participate on the student's behalf. The licensed professional referenced in this item may not be an employee of the local education agency or state education agency serving the student. (b) For the purposes of this section, a person is considered incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences if he is unable to: (i) express, either verbally, through an interpreter, or through augmented communication devices, his wishes, interests, or preferences for his education program; or (ii) understand, even with the support from family, administrators, and experts in the field, what choices are available in a proposed education decision or program. \"Support\" in this context includes a wide range of disability supports, including explaining options in plain language, using interpreters, providing visual aids, providing the information more slowly, or in similar chunks, or any other method that is effective in communicating with the student with a disability. (2) Upon receiving the certification, the superintendent of the local education agency or his designee shall, within ten days, provide a copy of the designation to the student and notify him in writing that a professional has certified that he is incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences with respect to his educational program and that an educational representative will be designated to make such decisions for him. The superintendent also shall notify the student in writing that he has a right to challenge the designation of the educational representative. (3) A challenge to the designation of an educational representative must be made in writing and may be made by the student or by another person with a bona fide interest and knowledge of the student, except that challenges may not be made by an employee of a local education agency or state education agency. A challenge by an adult student must assert that he is capable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences concerning his educational program as provided in this section. (a) A challenge may be made at any time during which an educational representative is designated to act on the adult student's behalf. A challenge must be provided in writing to the superintendent of the local school district or his designee, who shall within ten business days notify the student and current appointed representative in writing. (b) Upon receipt of a written challenge in accordance with this section, the local education agency may not rely on an educational representative for any purpose. (4) If the adult student does not object to the designation, his custodial parent or adult spouse may act as the educational representative. If the custodial parent or the adult spouse are unavailable to act on behalf of the student, the educational representative may be an adult sibling, grandparent, or other adult relative, in that order of priority. If these relatives are not willing and able to serve as the educational representative of the adult student, then the local education agency providing services to the student shall designate a surrogate parent, as defined in 34 C.F.R. Section 300.519 to serve in this capacity. (5) The authority of an educational representative is limited to the authority to consent to educational services, and specifically does not include the authority to remove an adult student from educational services. The authority of an educational representative continues until he challenges the designation, he is no longer eligible for special education, or an order is issued pursuant to Article 5, Title 62, which terminates the authority of the educational representative.

      "text": "As used in this section: (1) \"Evidence-based reading instruction\" means reading, writing, and spelling instruction that employs direct instruction of systematic and cumulative content, with the sequence beginning with the easiest and most basic elements, and progressing methodically to more difficult material. Each step also must be based on steps already learned. Components of evidence-based reading instruction include instruction targeting phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. (2) \"Dyslexia-specific intervention\" means evidence-based, specialized reading, writing, and spelling instruction that is multisensory in nature, equipping students to simultaneously use multiple senses, such as vision, hearing, touch, and movement. Dyslexia-specific intervention requires greater intensity, such as smaller groups, increased frequency of instruction, and individualized progression through steps, than typical evidence-based reading instruction. (3) \"Multi-tiered system of supports\" or \"MTSS\" means an evidence-based model of schooling that uses data-based problem solving to integrate academic and behavioral instruction and intervention. The integrated academic and behavioral supports are delivered to students at varying intensities by means of multiple tiers based on student need. Need-driven decision making seeks to ensure that district resources reach the appropriate students at their schools at the appropriate levels to accelerate the performance of all students to fulfill the profile of the South Carolina Graduate. (4) \"Response to Intervention\" or \"RTI\" means the process of providing high-quality instruction and intervention matched to student needs using learning rate over time and level of performance to make important instructional decisions. To ensure efficient use of resources, schools begin with the identification of trends and patterns using schoolwide data and grade level data. Students who need instructional intervention beyond what is provided universally for positive behavior or academic content areas are provided with targeted, supplemental interventions delivered individually or in small groups at increasing levels of intensity. RTI is a process that is driven by the use of a problem-solving model and is used for the purpose of revealing what works best for groups of students and individual students, regardless of placement. (5) \"Tiered instruction\" means instruction and intervention provided with increasing intensity in response to student needs. This instruction is typically provided in an RTI process depicted as a three-tier model. Data is collected at each tier and is used to measure the efficacy of the instruction and intervention so that meaningful decisions may be made about how instruction and intervention should be maintained and layered. Tier 1 is the foundation and consists of scientific, research-based core instructional and behavioral methodologies, practices, and supports designed for all students in the general curriculum. Tier 2 consists of supplemental, targeted instruction and interventions that are provided in addition to and in alignment with effective core instruction and behavioral supports to groups of targeted students who need additional instructional support, behavioral support, or both. Tier 3 consists of intensive instructional or behavioral interventions provided in addition to and in alignment with effective core instruction with the goal of increasing an individual student's rate of progress. Tier 3 interventions are developed for individual students using a problem-solving process. Students receiving Tier 3 level supports may or may not be eligible for specially designed instruction and related services in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act. (6) \"Problem-solving model\" means a problem-solving method used to match instructional resources to educational need. The problem-solving model uses data to define the problem, establish performance goals, develop intervention plans, monitor progress, and evaluate outcomes. (7) \"Universal screening process (USP)\" means the process a district employs to screen all students who may be experiencing academic and/or social-emotional difficulties. The screening tools and the process must be based on approval and guidelines provided by the department, which must include screening tools that must be administered at no cost to the district.

As part of the assessment, a universal screening process must be used to identify students who may be at risk of experiencing academic difficulties in reading, math, or writing, and who also may be at risk of experiencing difficulties in social-emotional development. (2) Beginning with the 2019-2020 School Year, to the extent funding is provided or that approved screening tools are available at no cost, a local school district shall use the universal screening process to screen each student in the district who is in kindergarten through first grade three times each school year and as needed in second grade as outlined in the district's universal screening procedures, and any other student as required by the department, for reading difficulties, including dyslexia, and the need for intervention. (3) In addition to screening required by this subsection, screening also may be requested for a student by his parent or guardian, teacher, counselor, or school psychologist. (B) The district, following the universal screening procedures it conducted, shall convene a school-based team to analyze screening data and progress monitoring data to assist teachers in planning and implementing appropriate instruction and evidence-based interventions for all students who, based on the screening, are at risk of experiencing academic difficulties, including those students who exhibit the characteristics of dyslexia, as provided by the department. Guidance may include suggestions of tiered interventions, dyslexia-specific interventions, academic and social-emotional supports, and supplemental technology as appropriate for the student's access to assistive technology. (C) If the RTI process conducted by the district indicates that a student is at risk for experiencing academic difficulties, including dyslexia, the district shall: (1) notify the parent or legal guardian of the student; (2) provide the parent or legal guardian of the student with information and resource material so that they may assist and support learning for their child; (3) provide the student with tiered, evidence-based intervention as defined in Section 59-33-510; and (4) monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and the student's progress.
