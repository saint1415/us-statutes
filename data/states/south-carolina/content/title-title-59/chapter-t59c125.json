In electing members of the board, the General Assembly shall elect members based on merit regardless of race, color, creed, or gender and shall strive to assure that the membership of the board is representative of all citizens of the State of South Carolina. The elective members of the board of trustees shall continue to serve until the thirtieth day of June of the year in which their terms are scheduled to expire. Those persons elected by the General Assembly shall have their seats designated as the seat number corresponding to the congressional district from which they are elected with the at-large members designated as Seat Eight, Seat Nine, and Seat Ten with the present at-large member of the board deemed to be serving in Seat Eight. The General Assembly shall hold elections to fill vacancies as they occur on the board by the expiration of terms of office, as follows: Seat One in 2006, Seat Two in 2008, Seat Three in 2004, Seat Four in 2004, Seat Five in 2006, Seat Six in 2008, Seat Seven in 2018, Seat Eight in 2005, Seat Nine in 2008, and Seat Ten in 2009.

It is lawful for the trustees to use a portion of the principal proceeds derived from any sale of bonds, except bonds issued to effect refunding of outstanding bonds, to meet the payment of interest on the bonds for a period equal to the period of construction of the facilities to be financed with the proceeds of such bonds plus a period not exceeding six months. It is recognized by the General Assembly that until the facilities to be constructed with the proceeds of the loan are completed, an undue burden may be imposed upon the existing revenues at that time; (2) pledge the revenues or the net revenues of the facilities as designated by the trustees in connection with the issuance of the bonds whether then or after that time to be existing and to pledge any otherwise available gifts, grants, or donations to Winthrop for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds as they respectively mature. However, any surplus of the revenues or net revenues available after the payment of costs of operation and maintenance of the facilities and of debt service on the bonds, and the establishment of any debt service reserve obligation under the proceedings providing for the issuance of the bonds, is placed in a contingency and improvement fund for the facilities in order to restore depreciated or obsolete items of the facilities, to make improvements to the facilities, to defray the cost of unforeseen contingencies with regard to the facilities, to prevent defaults under such bonds, or to redeem any of the bonds; (3) further secure the bonds with a pledge of any additional revenues or fees of Winthrop as may be authorized under other laws of this State; (4) covenant that no facilities owned by Winthrop may be used free of charge, or to specify and limit the facilities which may be used free of charge; (5) covenant to establish and maintain a system of rules as will ensure the continuous use and occupancy of the facilities whose revenues are pledged to secure any bonds; (6) covenant that an adequate schedule of charges be established and maintained for the facilities designated by the trustees, whose revenues or net revenues are pledged to secure the bonds, to the extent necessary to produce sufficient revenues to: (a) pay the cost of operating and maintaining the facilities, whose revenues or net revenues are pledged for the payment of the bonds, including the cost of fire, extended coverage and use, and occupancy insurance; (b) pay the principal and interest of the bonds as they respectively become due; (c) create and at all times maintain an adequate debt service reserve fund to meet the payment of the principal and interest; and (d) create and at all times maintain an adequate reserve for contingencies and for major repairs and replacement. (7) covenant against the mortgaging or disposing of the facilities designated by the trustees, whose revenues or net revenues are pledged for the payment of the bonds, and against permitting or suffering any lien to be created on them equal or superior to the lien created for the benefit of such bonds. The trustees are empowered to discontinue the use of or demolish obsolete facilities and to reserve the right, under the terms they prescribe, to issue additional bonds on a parity with the bonds authorized by this article, if at some later date they obtain legislative authorization for the issuance of additional bonds; (8) covenant as to the use of the proceeds derived from the sale of any bonds issued pursuant to this article; (9) provide for the terms, form, registration, exchange, execution, and authentication of bonds, and for the replacement of lost, destroyed, or mutilated bonds; (10) make covenants with respect to the use of the facilities to be constructed with the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this article and of the other facilities whose revenues must be pledged for the payment of the bonds; (11) covenant that all revenues or net revenues of the particular facilities pledged for the payment of the bonds must be segregated into special funds and that the funds must be used solely for the purposes for which they are intended and for no other purpose; (12) covenant for the mandatory redemption of bonds on the terms and conditions as the resolutions authorizing the bonds prescribe; (13) provide for early defeasance of bonds through the establishment of special escrow accounts maintained by a corporate trustee, which may be the State Treasurer, of cash or United States government obligations, or obligations of agencies of them, which escrows may be funded with proceeds of bonds issued under the provisions of this article or revenues or other funds available to Winthrop; (14) prescribe the procedure, if any, by which the terms of the contract with the bondholders may be amended, the number of bonds whose holders must consent to it, and the manner in which consent is given; (15) covenant as to the maintenance of the facilities, whose revenues must be pledged for the payment of the bonds, the insurance to be carried on them, and the use and disposition of proceeds from any insurance policy; (16) prescribe the events of default and the terms and conditions upon which all or any bonds become or may be declared due before maturity and the terms and conditions upon which the declaration and its consequences may be waived; (17) impose a statutory lien upon the facilities designated by the trustees, the revenues or net revenues of which must be pledged to secure the bonds. The lien must extend to the facilities, to their appurtenances and extension, to their additions, improvements, and enlargements to the extent specified in the resolutions and must inure to the benefit of the holders of the bonds secured by the lien. The facilities remain subject to the statutory lien until the payment in full of the principal and interest of the bonds. A holder of a bond, or any of the coupons representing interest on them, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, may protect and enforce the statutory lien, and by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings may enforce and compel performance of all duties of the trustees, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the proper segregation of the revenues, and the proper application of them. However, the statutory lien may not be construed to give the bond or coupon holder authority to compel the sale of any of the facilities or any part of them; (18) covenant that if there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest upon any of the bonds, a court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the facilities designated by the trustees, whose revenues or net revenues are pledged for the payment of the bonds, with power to fix rates and charges for the facilities, sufficient to provide for the payment of the expense of operating and maintaining the facilities, and to apply the income and revenues of the facilities to the payment of the bonds and the interest on them; (19) establish on or before the delivery of any bonds issued pursuant to this article a debt service reserve fund and to cause it to be deposited with a corporate trustee, who may be the State Treasurer, and to that end, the trustees are empowered to utilize any monies available for that purpose, including revenues previously accumulated from the facilities before the issuance of bonds. In the discretion of the trustees, in lieu of cash, the debt service reserve fund may be funded with a surety bond, insurance policy, letter of credit, line of credit, or similar guarantee. At the discretion of the trustees, Winthrop may purchase an insurance policy insuring payment of both principal and interest on any issuance of bonds under the provisions of this article; (20) appoint a corporate trustee, who may be the State Treasurer, or paying agent to whom must be paid all or any portion of the revenues or net revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds or derived from the operation of the facilities, and to prescribe the manner in which these revenues or net revenues must be utilized and disposed of. The corporate trustee shall serve in a fiduciary capacity as trustee for the bondholders under the resolutions of the trustees authorizing the issuance of bonds.

Winthrop University has demonstrated need for additional funds to provide for acquisition, construction, renovation, and equipping of such facilities. These facilities are needed to replace or renovate aging facilities and to provide additional facilities all to the end that the educational environment at Winthrop University will be enhanced for the benefit of present and future students at Winthrop University. (B) Consideration has been given to this need and to the methods of funding it. It has been determined to be in the best interests of the people of this State to authorize Winthrop University to acquire, construct, renovate, and equip additional such facilities and to incur indebtedness for these purposes which is payable from the revenues derived from the operation of these facilities and from related fees to the extent and under the conditions provided for in this article.

      "text": "To the end that the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized hereby are adequately secured, the trustees are empowered in their discretion: (1) to issue bonds in such amount, within the limitations herein provided for, as the trustees consider necessary, it is lawful for the trustees to use a portion of the principal proceeds derived from any sale of bonds, except bonds issued to effect refunding of outstanding bonds, to meet the payment of interest on such bonds for a period equal to the period of construction or renovation of the athletic facilities to be financed with the proceeds of such bonds, plus a period not exceeding six months, it being recognized by the General Assembly, that until the athletic facilities to be constructed or renovated with the proceeds of the bonds are completed, an undue burden may be imposed upon then existing revenues or other sources of payment of the bonds; (2) to impose admissions fees and a special student fee upon such basis and in such amounts as the trustees shall determine; (3) to pledge the revenues or the net revenues as designated by the trustees, and the proceeds of any admissions fees and special student fee, as security for the payment of such bonds, whether then or thereafter to be existing. However, any surplus of such revenues or net revenues available after the payment of costs of operation and maintenance of the athletic department and of athletic facilities and of debt service on such bonds, and the establishment of any debt service reserve obligation in a bond reserve fund under the proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds, may be placed in a contingency and improvement fund for athletic facilities in order to restore depreciated or obsolete athletic facilities, to make improvements to such athletic facilities, to defray the cost of unforeseen contingencies with regard to such athletic facilities, to prevent defaults under such bonds or to redeem any of such bonds, or may be reflected in the opening balance of the operating fund of the department for the next succeeding fiscal year and used for any purpose approved by the trustees; (4) to further secure the bonds with a pledge of any additional revenues or fees of Winthrop as may be authorized under other laws of the State; (5) to specify and limit the athletic facilities which may be made use of free of charge; (6) to covenant to establish and maintain such system of rules as will ensure the continuous and effective use of the athletic facilities; (7) to covenant that an adequate schedule of rates and charges for attendance at events held at any athletic facilities will be maintained, and that net athletic revenues plus any proceeds of the admissions fees and the special student fee will be sufficient to: (a) pay the cost of operating and maintaining the athletic department and the athletic facilities, including the cost of fire, extended coverage and use, and occupancy insurance; (b) pay the principal and interest of the bonds as they respectively become due; (c) provide any necessary debt service coverage ratios; (d) create and maintain any bond reserve fund established to meet the payment of principal and interest of any of the bonds; and (e) create and at all times maintain an adequate reserve for contingencies and for major repairs and replacement of athletic facilities; (8) to covenant against the mortgaging or disposing of the athletic facilities and against permitting or suffering any lien to be created thereon, equal or superior to any lien created thereon for the benefit of the holders of such bonds. However, the trustees reserve the right, under such terms as they shall prescribe, to issue additional bonds on a parity with, or subordinate to, the bonds authorized by this article; (9) to covenant as to the use of the proceeds derived from the sale of any bonds issued pursuant to this article; (10) to provide for the terms, form, registration, exchange, execution, and authentication of bonds, and for the replacement of lost, destroyed, or mutilated bonds; (11) to make covenants with respect to the operation of the athletic department and the athletic facilities; (12) to covenant that all revenues or net revenues pledged for the payment of the bonds must be duly segregated into special funds and that such funds will be used solely for the purposes for which they are intended and for no other purpose; (13) to covenant for the mandatory redemption of bonds on such terms and conditions as the resolutions authorizing such bonds shall prescribe; (14) to provide for early defeasance of bonds through the establishment of special escrow accounts maintained by a corporate trustee, which may be the State Treasurer, of cash, or United States government obligations, or obligations of agencies thereof, which escrows may be funded with proceeds of bonds issued hereunder or revenues or net revenues or other funds available to Winthrop; (15) to prescribe the procedure, if any, by which the terms of the contract with the bondholders may be amended, the number of bonds whose holders must consent thereto, and the manner in which consent shall be given; (16) to covenant as to the maintenance of the athletic facilities, the insurance to be carried thereon, and the use and disposition of proceeds from any insurance policy; (17) to prescribe the events of default and the terms and conditions upon which all or any bonds become or may be declared due before maturity, and the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived; (18) to impose a statutory lien upon any athletic facilities as security for the payment of the bonds. The lien shall extend to such athletic facilities, to their appurtenances and extensions, to their additions, improvements, and enlargements to the extent specified in the resolutions and shall inure to the benefit of the holders of the bonds secured thereby. These athletic facilities shall remain subject to such statutory lien until the payment in full of the principal and interest of the bonds. Any holder of any of the bonds, or any of the coupons representing interest thereon, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce the statutory lien, and may, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings enforce and compel performance of all duties of the trustees, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the proper segregation of the revenues, and the proper application thereof. However, the statutory lien must not be construed to give any such bond or coupon holder authority to compel the sale of any of the athletic facilities or any part thereof; (19) to covenant that, if there be any default in the payment of the principal of or interest upon any of the bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the athletic department, with power to fix rates and charges for athletic facilities and other activities of the athletic department, and to apply the income and revenues of the athletic department to the payment of such bonds and the interest thereon; (20) to establish on or before the occasion of the delivery of any bonds issued pursuant to this article a bond reserve fund and to cause the same to be maintained by the State Treasurer or its corporate trustee designee, and to that end, the trustees are empowered to utilize any monies available for the funding of any such bond reserve fund, including revenues or net revenues previously accumulated prior to the issuance of bonds or available proceeds of the admissions fee or the special student fee. In the discretion of the trustees, in lieu of cash, such a bond reserve fund may be funded with a surety bond, insurance policy, letter of credit, line of credit, or similar guarantee. At the discretion of the trustees, Winthrop may purchase an insurance policy ensuring payment of both principal and interest on any issuance of bonds hereunder; (21) with the consent of the State Treasurer, to appoint a corporate trustee and a paying agent for the bondholders, either of whom may be the State Treasurer, and to prescribe the manner in which revenues or net revenues, as well as proceeds of admissions fees and special student fees shall be utilized and disposed of. Any such corporate trustee shall serve in a fiduciary capacity as trustee for the bondholders under the resolutions of the trustees authorizing the issuance of bonds.
