      "text": "(A) The State Department of Education shall formulate an implementation plan to accomplish the following national education goals as applicable to South Carolina, which are:\n\n(1) By the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn.\n\n(2) By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will increase to at least ninety percent.\n\n(3) By the year 2000, American students will leave grades four, eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter including English, mathematics, science, history, and geography, and every school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our modern economy. The South Carolina goals also include the areas of foreign languages, health and physical education, arts and humanities, and occupational education as part of this goal.\n\n(4) By the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement.\n\n(5) By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\n\n(6) By the year 2000, every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and will offer a disciplined environment conducive of learning.\n\nThe Department of Education, building upon the South Carolina Total Quality Education Framework for Change and the South Carolina Goals Panel Report shall formulate this plan, which must focus on equity, productivity, and interagency collaboration to meet the National Goals by the year 2000.\n\nThe plan at a minimum shall address:\n\n(a) a review of the Education Finance Act and a Defined Maximum Program;\n\n(b) a review of the Education Improvement Act and Target 2000;\n\n(c) an alignment of the plan with the national goals;\n\n(d) an identification of sources and reallocation of funds and revenue;\n\n(e) accountability measures for state agencies, local school districts, and local communities;\n\n(f) a system which connects funding costs with school performance effectiveness;\n\n(g) a system for coordinating interagency funds to support health, social, and education services to children and families; and\n\n(h) a system for coordinating funds with technical colleges and higher education to support lifelong learning.\n\nThe Education Improvement Act is to be included in this review, but all EIA funds must be used only for new reforms and innovations and not for regular ongoing operations at schools, although after this review the reforms and innovations for which these funds were dedicated may be different than originally provided.\n\n(B) In formulating this plan the Department of Education shall coordinate its efforts with the South Carolina Business-Education Partnership for Excellence in Education, to include its planning committee and outreach committee and also the accountability committee of the Business Education Subcommittee.\n\nInput must be solicited from the State Board of Education, South Carolina Education Goals Panel, EIA Education Oversight Committee, Human Services Coordinating Council, South Carolina Business Center for Education, Chamber of Commerce, South Carolina School Boards Association, South Carolina Association of School Administrators, South Carolina Parent Teacher Association, South Carolina School Improvement Councils, Palmetto Teachers Association, South Carolina Education Association, South Carolina Teacher Forum, American Association of Retired Persons, Business and Community Representatives, Regional Goals Coordinating Councils and America 2000 communities.\n\nThis plan shall reflect a systemic approach that applies the principles of Total Quality Management and strategies of effectiveness which reflect state accountability, local school district accountability, and community accountability. The plan must relate to learning and school effectiveness standards developed by the State Board of Education through the State Department of Education, to restructuring efforts that relate to local school districts, and to partnerships that relate to local communities. Examples of these standards and efforts include:\n\n(1) curriculum frameworks in each subject area;\n\n(2) accreditation and accountability of schools;\n\n(3) assessment of student learning;\n\n(4) empowerment of the existing and future teaching force;\n\n(5) instructional materials and technology;\n\n(6) extensive use of the Leadership Academy;\n\n(7) seed money for restructuring initiatives;\n\n(8) staff development through the use of \"lighthouse schools\";\n\n(9) understanding of educational renewal and restructuring;\n\n(10) school to work transitions;\n\n(11) motivational programs for students and parents;\n\n(12) increased collaboration between K-12 and higher education;\n\n(13) collaborative-decentralized governance;\n\n(14) case management and collocation services to emotionally and physically handicapped children and their families;\n\n(15) targeted education and health services to special needs groups;\n\n(16) educational and health counseling services with local and community input on the negative impact of teen pregnancy and the positive impact of delaying parenthood;\n\n(17) contracting between public schools and health related entities;\n\n(18) maximizing federal and other funds to ensure that children are provided health screenings; and\n\n(19) providing extended care services to working parents.\n\n(C)(1) By August 1, 1993, a draft of the format to be used in developing the plan must be presented for review and approval to the State Board of Education, the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Education and Public Works Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and Senate Education Committee.\n\n(2) By September 1, 1994, the Department of Education shall submit for review and approval to the EIA Education Oversight Committee and the Business Education Subcommittee the proposed time lines, funding requirements, and necessary steps to implement the plan for each of the next five years from 1995 to 2000.\n\n(3) During the months of November and December, 1994, the State Department of Education and the South Carolina Business-Education Partnership Committee shall meet with and request comment from, but not limited to, the major education associations, the Congress of Parents and Teachers, the state and local Chambers of Commerce, the State Board of Education, Regional Goals Coordinating Councils, Human Service Coordinating Council, Regional EIA Councils, the Principal's Council, Council of College Presidents, South Carolina Council of Educational Collaboration, the Commission on Higher Education, South Carolina Teachers' Forum, EIA Education Oversight Committee, House Education and Public Works Committee, Senate Education Committee, House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Long Term Policy and Planning, and Senate Finance Subcommittee on Education on the proposed time lines, funding requirements and necessary specific steps to implement the plan for each of the next five years.\n\n(4) By January 1, 1995, the State Department of Education shall submit to the State Board of Education, the Governor, and the General Assembly the revised plan which establishes accountability measures at the state level, accountability measures at local district level and supporting interagency partnerships at the community level, funding requirements, and appropriate time lines.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 164, Part II, Section 33; 1998 Act No. 400, Section 15.",
