It shall elect teachers of professorial rank in the various colleges which make up the Medical University of South Carolina and other officers and employees as may be necessary for the proper conduct of the university and fix their compensation, the fees and charges of students, and the rules for the government of the university. The board of trustees also has the following powers: (1) to make bylaws and regulations considered expedient for the management of its affairs and its own operations not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of this State or of the United States; (2) to confer the appropriate degrees in medicine, dental medicine, pharmacy, nursing, health-related professions, and graduate studies in related health fields upon students and other persons as in the opinion of the board of trustees may be qualified to receive them; and (3) to make contracts and to have, to hold, to purchase, and to lease real estate and personal property for corporate purposes; and to sell and dispose of personal property and any buildings that are considered by it as surplus property or no longer needed and any buildings that it may need to do away with for the purpose of making room for other construction. These powers must be exercised in a manner consistent with the provisions of Chapter 35 of Title 11. (B) All revenues of the Medical University of South Carolina, the Medical University Hospital, and any funds transferred to the Medical University from a practice plan must be expended for a public purpose as that purpose is defined in the applicable state law and regulations. For purposes of this subsection, and in addition to all other applicable laws and regulations, public purposes also do not include expenditures for purchasing gifts, making political or other contributions, and reimbursing officers' and employees' travel and subsistence expenses in excess of those authorized by law for state employees away from their job site on official business. (C) The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act apply to the Medical University Hospital Authority, except that access is not allowed under this section to patient records or insurance information with respect to patients. (D) Members of the Medical University Board, while serving as members of the hospital authority and the officers and employees of the hospital authority, shall be subject to applicable state ethics and accountability provisions of law. (E) As shall be provided in an implementing resolution by the Board of Trustees of the Medical University of South Carolina, the Board of Trustees of the Medical University of South Carolina becomes the governing body of the Medical University hospitals, clinics, and other health care and related facilities (hereinafter 'hospital') as shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the board. Whenever the board functions in its capacity as the governing body of the hospital, the board of trustees is constituted and designated as the Medical University Hospital Authority, an agency of the State of South Carolina (hereinafter called authority).

Any guarantee or indebtedness of the authority shall not create an obligation of the State, nor shall such guarantee or indebtedness be considered a debt against the general revenue of the State; (d) for the purpose of effectuating the provisions of subitem (c) above, utilize all provisions of the Hospital Revenue Bond Act. The issuance by the authority of any bonds, notes, or other obligations or indebtedness, except as provided in this subitem, shall be subject to the approval thereof by resolution of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority. Except for such approving resolution, the requirements of Section 44-7-1590 of the Hospital Revenue Bond Act shall be applicable to obligations issued by the authority. The authority may issue revenue anticipation notes and such notes shall have a maturity of not exceeding six months from date of issuance and shall not exceed, in the aggregate, ten percent of the net patient service revenue for the fiscal year of the authority preceding the fiscal year in which such obligations are issued; (4) receive contributions, donations, and payments and invest and disburse its funds; provided, however, that these funds are funds which must be used for public purposes, and further, that the authority may not use or authorize the use of funds, property, or time to influence the outcome of an election; (5) construct, operate, and maintain the hospital and related premises, buildings and facilities, and infrastructure; (6) appoint such officers, employees, personnel, and agents of the authority and define such duties and fix their compensation in such manner as is necessary to carry out the authority's activities and affairs; the policies of the authority's personnel and employees are exempt from Department of Administration personnel policies and applicable laws; all personnel employed by the authority are exempt from the provisions of Article 5, Chapter 17 of Title 8, the State Employee Grievance Procedure, but the board shall adopt a grievance procedure substantially similar to the provisions of that article to govern personnel and employees of the authority, and this procedure must be filed with and approved by the State Department of Administration. All employees of the authority must be furnished a copy of this grievance procedure; all personnel employed by the authority are employees-at-will and are state employees for purposes of eligibility for participation in the South Carolina Retirement System, the State Health Insurance Group plans, and pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act; (7) make pension payments to the South Carolina Retirement Systems on behalf of personnel or employees employed by the authority who qualify in the same manner as other state employees in the executive branch of government; (8) pay contributions to the Office of Insurance Services for health and dental plans on behalf of personnel employed by the authority who qualify in the same manner as other state employees in the executive branch of government; (9) receive, expend, and control under its own name and account any appropriated funds, federal funds, donations, and grants made available to the authority; provided, however, that these funds are funds which must be used for a public purpose, and further, that the authority may not use or authorize the use of funds, property, or time to influence the outcome of an election; (10) conduct an annual fiscal audit by certified public accountants selected by the authority who shall review the accounts of the authority and report such findings of the audit to the Governor and the General Assembly in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; (11) prepare and submit an annual budget to the General Assembly and the Governor for review; (12) establish management controls and staffing of personnel as the authority deems most appropriate for the prudent conduct of the activities and affairs of the hospital; provided, that they establish an internal audit function that would report directly to the authority; (13) establish such not-for-profit corporations as the board considers necessary to assist the authority in carrying out its functions; provided, that any entity created pursuant to this subsection is considered to be an entity of the authority and subject to all laws and regulations applicable to the authority under this section.

(F) Upon review of the audit report required in Section 59-123-60(E)(10), the legislature, by joint resolution, or the Governor, by Executive Order, may request audits to be completed by the State Auditors Office or the Legislative Audit Council. Based on the findings reported in the audit required in Section 59-123-60(E)(10) by the State Auditors Office or by the Legislative Audit Council, the legislature, by joint resolution, may require intervention by the State Fiscal Accountability Authority for the purposes of rectifying any material findings reflected in the audits. (G) A member of the Medical University Board, an officer in the administration of the university, including deans of the various colleges, the President of the Medical University, or any other officer of the authority or any of its affiliates who have been found guilty of malfeasance, misfeasance, incompetence, absenteeism, conflict of interest, misconduct, persistent neglect of duty in office, or incapacity shall be subject to removal by the Governor upon any of the foregoing causes being made to appear to the satisfaction of the Governor. But before removing any such person, the Governor shall inform him in writing of the specific charges against him and give him an opportunity on reasonable notice to be heard. The Governor shall appoint a successor to fill the vacancy created by his removal. The successor appointed by the Governor is to serve in that position until a successor is elected and qualified in accordance with Section 59-123-50. (H) The authority shall offer and provide to the Medical University of South Carolina the services necessary for the training and education of health professionals. (I) Beginning in fiscal year 2000-2001 state appropriations to the Medical University of South Carolina for support of the Medical University hospitals and clinics shall be redirected to the Department of Health and Human Services. These funds shall be used as match funds for the disproportionate share for the hospital's federal program. Any excess funding may be used for hospital base rate increases. Beginning in fiscal year 2000-2001 and in subsequent years, the Department of Health and Human Services shall pay to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital Authority an amount equal to the amount appropriated for its disproportionate share to the Department of Health and Human Services. This payment shall be in addition to any other funds that are available to the authority from the Medicaid program inclusive of the disproportionate share for the hospital's federal program. The authority shall continue to operate the hospital as a health provider for the citizens of South Carolina and the clinical site for the education and training programs of the Medical University of South Carolina. (J) The board, as the governing body of the authority, shall adopt a written policy for the hospital for the expenditure of public funds. Public funds may be expended for events which recognize academic and research excellence and noteworthy accomplishments of members of the faculty and staff, students, and distinguished guests of the authority. Sources of the funds for these expenditures include only nonappropriated state funds. The expenditure of funds from these sources pursuant to the written policy of the board for the purpose stated in this section are considered to meet the public purpose test for expenditure of public funds. (K) The authority and its permanent improvements and the financing thereof shall be exempt from the provisions of Chapter 47 of Title 2, and the leasing of property and the granting of easements and rights of way by the authority shall be exempt from the provisions of Sections 1-11-55, 1-11-56, 1-11-57(1), and 10-1-130. (L) The authority and the board of trustees as the governing body of the authority shall succeed to all of the rights, duties, and obligations of the Medical University of South Carolina and the board of trustees, respectively, as owner and operator of the hospital. All property, real, personal, tangible, or intangible (including, without limitation, deposits, investments, and accounts receivable) of the Medical University relating to the hospital shall be and become the property of the authority. The Medical University and its officers are authorized to execute and deliver such instruments of conveyance or agreements as may be determined by the board to be necessary or useful to effect or evidence such transfer.\" HISTORY: 1962 Code Section 22-355; 1952 Code Section 22-355; 1942 Code Section 5796; 1932 Code Section 5796; Civ.

(2) To pledge the entire revenues specified in Section 59-123-230 for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds as they respectively mature. (3) To covenant that no housing facilities owned by the Medical University will be used free of charge, or to specify and limit the facilities which may be made use of free of charge. (4) To covenant to establish and maintain such system of rules as will insure the continuous use and occupancy of the facilities, whose revenues are pledged to secure any bonds. (5) To covenant that an adequate schedule of charges will be established and maintained for all the facilities, whose revenues shall be pledged to secure any bonds, to the extent necessary to produce sufficient revenues to: (a) Pay the cost of operating and maintaining the facilities including the cost of fire, extended coverage and occupancy insurance; (b) Pay the principal and interest of the bonds as they respectively become due; (c) Create and at all times maintain an adequate Debt Service Reserve Fund to meet the payment of such principal and interest; and (d) Create and at all times maintain an adequate reserve for contingencies, and for major repairs and replacement.

(7) To covenant as to the use of the proceeds derived from the sale of any bonds issued pursuant to Sections 59-123-210 through 59-123-320.

(12) To prescribe the procedure, if any, by which the terms of the contract with the bondholders may be amended, the number of bonds whose holders must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent shall be given. (13) To covenant as to the maintenance of the facilities, whose revenues shall be pledged for the payment of the bonds, the insurance to be carried thereon, and the use and disposition of proceeds from any insurance policy. (14) To prescribe the events of default and the terms and conditions upon which all or any bonds shall become or may be declared due before maturity, and the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived. (15) To impose a statutory lien upon the facilities, whose revenues shall be pledged to secure the bonds. Such lien shall extend to such facilities, to their appurtenances and extensions, to their additions, improvements, and enlargements to the extent specified in the resolutions and shall insure to the benefit of the holders of the bonds secured thereby.

Provided, however, that the statutory lien shall not be construed to give any such bond or coupon holder authority to compel the sale of any of the facilities, or any part thereof. (16) To covenant that if there be any default in the payment of the principal of or interest upon any of the bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the facilities, whose revenues shall be pledged for the payment of such bonds, with power to fix rates and charges for the facilities, sufficient to provide for the payment of the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities, and to apply the income and revenues of such facilities to the payment of such bonds, and the interest thereon.
