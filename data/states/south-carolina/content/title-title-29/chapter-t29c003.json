It is not necessary that the mortgage state as part of the maximum principal the amount of any deferred, accrued, or capitalized interest or discount of any nature or kind, whether the rate of interest or discount is fixed or variable pursuant to an alternative mortgage loan transaction as defined in Section 37-1-301(5), and the lien of the mortgage as to all that interest or discount shall have the same priority as the principal; provided, however, that the recorded mortgage discloses that interest or discount will be deferred, accrued, or capitalized. However, the lien of a person who has furnished labor, services, or material in connection with the construction of improvements to real property is superior to the lien of a recorded mortgage as to disbursements made after filing of the notice of the mechanic's lien required by Section 29-5-90 and service of the notice on all prior recorded mortgage holders. Service of the notice on prior recorded mortgage holders must be made pursuant to Rule 4 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.

(B) Any mortgage or other instrument which by its terms creates an interest in or a lien upon any real property interest held by a gas or electrical utility or electric cooperative, securing existing indebtedness or indebtedness to be incurred in the future, is valid from the day and hour when recorded. It affects and is prior to the rights of all creditors and purchasers for valuable consideration without notice and all liens except liens of record prior to recordation of the mortgage, regardless of whether there is an actual debt outstanding at the time of recordation of the mortgage, to the same extent as if the future indebtedness were incurred as of the date of the execution of the mortgage or other instrument for the total amount of indebtedness thereafter incurred, together with all other indebtedness and sums secured thereby. However, the total amount of existing indebtedness and future indebtedness at any one time may not exceed the maximum principal amount stated therein plus interest thereon, attorney's fees and court costs, and the mortgage or other instrument must contemplate that future indebtedness may be incurred. The mortgage or other instrument shall remain a valid lien and effective as record notice thereof until satisfied or released of record even though there are periods during which no indebtedness is outstanding thereunder. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the lien of a person who has furnished labor, services, or materials in connection with the construction of improvements to real property is superior to the lien of a recorded mortgage as to indebtedness actually incurred after filing of the notice of the mechanic's lien required by Section 29-3-90 and service of the notice on all prior recorded mortgage holders. Service of the notice on prior recorded mortgage holders must be made pursuant to Rule 4 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. The priority of the mechanic's lien extends only to the mortgage indebtedness actually incurred after the filing of the lien and service of the notice on all prior recorded mortgage holders.

(B) If a satisfaction or affidavit of satisfaction of a mortgage or other lien affecting real property is recorded in error or a mortgage or other lien affecting real property is satisfied of record erroneously by another means, a document of rescission that has been duly witnessed and notarized in compliance with Section 30-5-30 may be executed and recorded. Upon recording, the document of rescission rescinds the erroneously recorded satisfaction or affidavit and the erroneous satisfaction of record of the mortgage or other lien affecting real property and reinstates the mortgage or other lien affecting real property as of the mortgage's original filing date. The clerk of court, register of deeds, or registrar of mesne conveyance shall index the document of rescission as of the date of filing. (C)(1) A recorded document of rescission has no effect and does not constitute a lien as to the rights of any grantee or lien creditor, their heirs, successors, or assigns who records an interest in the real property described in a mortgage or other lien affecting real property after the recording of the satisfaction or affidavit of satisfaction of the mortgage, or other lien affecting real property and before the recording of the document of rescission, with a grantee under deed of title taking the property free and clear of the mortgage or other lien that was erroneously satisfied if the deed of title was received during the time period between the recording of the erroneous satisfaction and the end of the next business day observed at the clerk of court, register of deeds, or registrar of mesne conveyance's office following the recording of the document of rescission; and (2) any person or entity otherwise having priority over or taking free of the lien created by the mortgage or other lien affecting real property as reinstated. (D) A creditor who erroneously or wrongfully records a document of rescission is liable to a person injured by the recording for a sum of money not exceeding one-half of the original face amount of the debt secured by the mortgage or twenty-five thousand dollars, whichever is less, plus actual damages, costs, and attorney's fees. (E) The clerk of court, register of deeds, or registrar of mesne conveyance shall collect a filing fee of six dollars, and an additional one dollar per page for a document containing more than one page.

(B) For the purposes of this section, real property must not be considered \"abandoned\" if, on the property, there is: (1) an unoccupied building which is undergoing construction, renovation, or rehabilitation that is proceeding diligently to completion, and the building is in compliance with all applicable ordinances, codes, regulations, and statutes; (2) a building occupied on a seasonal basis, but otherwise secure; (3) a building that is secure, but is the subject of a probate action, action to quiet title, or other ownership dispute; or (4) a building owned by a property owner who is deceased and the heirs can be identified. The mortgage holder must submit proof that efforts were made to identify and contact heirs. (C) A mortgagee or successor in interest to a mortgagee may move the court for an expedited judgment of foreclosure and sale of real property that is considered \"abandoned\" pursuant to this section. The motion must be a motion to expedite foreclosure and sale, which: (1) must be supported by affidavit and must set forth the facts pursuant to subsection (A) demonstrating that the mortgaged property is abandoned; and (2) may be filed by the mortgagee at the time the Order of Reference is filed or any time thereafter. (D) In addition to any notices required to be served by law or the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a mortgagee shall, in a motion to proceed pursuant to this section or with any rule to show cause served as original service of process, serve a notice on each defendant that the mortgagee is seeking an entry of a judgment and decree of foreclosure on the date fixed by the court or on the return date of the rule to show cause. (E) A motion to expedite foreclosure and sale may be heard by the master-in-equity or special referee, or in those counties without a master-in-equity, by a circuit judge. (F) A motion to expedite a foreclosure action is designated as a priority matter pursuant to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and should be heard by the court as quickly as possible. (G) The court, after a hearing, shall grant the motion to expedite foreclosure and sale and enter a judgment of foreclosure and sale upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the mortgaged property is abandoned as defined under subsection (A); and (2) the pleadings, documents filed with the court, and testimony supports the entry of a final judgment of foreclosure and sale. (H) The court shall not grant the motion to expedite foreclosure and sale or enter a judgment of foreclosure and sale if the court finds that: (1) the mortgaged property is not abandoned; or (2) the mortgagor or any other defendant has filed an answer, appearance, or other written objection that is not withdrawn and the defenses or objections asserted provide cause to preclude the entry of a judgment of foreclosure and sale. (I) If a motion to expedite foreclosure and sale is denied, the court may direct that the foreclosure action continue pursuant to standard procedure under South Carolina law for mortgage foreclosure actions for properties that are not abandoned. (J) Nothing in this section may be construed to supersede or limit procedures adopted by the South Carolina Supreme Court to resolve residential mortgage foreclosure actions.
