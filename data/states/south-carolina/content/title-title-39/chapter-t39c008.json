(2) \"Misappropriation\" means: (a) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person by improper means; (b) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (c) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was: (A) derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it; (B) acquired by mistake or under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or (C) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or (iii) before a material change of his position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake. (3) \"Owner\" means the person or entity in whom or in which rightful legal or equitable title to the trade secret is reposed. (4) \"Person\" means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity. (5) \"Trade secret\" means: (a) information including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, product, system, or process, design, prototype, procedure, or code that: (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by the public or any other person who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. (b) A trade secret may consist of a simple fact, item, or procedure, or a series or sequence of items or procedures which, although individually could be perceived as relatively minor or simple, collectively can make a substantial difference in the efficiency of a process or the production of a product, or may be the basis of a marketing or commercial strategy. The collective effect of the items and procedures must be considered in any analysis of whether a trade secret exists and not the general knowledge of each individual item or procedure.

(B) Every employee who is informed of or should reasonably have known from the circumstances of the existence of any employer's trade secret has a duty to refrain from using or disclosing the trade secret without the employer's permission independently of and in addition to any written contract of employment, secrecy agreement, noncompete agreement, nondisclosure agreement, or other agreement between the employer and the employee. (C) A person aggrieved by a misappropriation, wrongful disclosure, or wrongful use of his trade secrets may bring a civil action to recover damages incurred as a result of the wrongful acts and to enjoin its appropriation, disclosure, use, or wrongful acts pertaining to the trade secrets. (D) A contractual duty not to disclose or divulge a trade secret, to maintain the secrecy of a trade secret, or to limit the use of a trade secret must not be considered void or unenforceable or against public policy for lack of a durational or geographical limitation. (E) This chapter applies to any and all civil remedies which are based upon misappropriation of a trade secret or upon protection of a trade secret except as provided in Section 39-8-110(B) and (C).

(B) Damages may include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation or the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret. (C) Upon a finding of wilful, wanton, or reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights, the court may award separate exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection (A).

(B) In any civil action where discovery is sought of information designated by its holder as a trade secret, before ordering discovery a court shall first determine whether there is a substantial need by the party seeking discovery for the information. \"Substantial need\" as used in this section means: (1) the allegations in the initial pleading setting forth the factual predicate for or against liability have been plead with particularity; (2) the information sought is directly relevant to the allegations plead with particularity in the initial pleading; (3) the information is such that the proponent of the discovery will be substantially prejudiced if not permitted access to the information; and (4) a good faith basis exists for the belief that testimony based on or evidence deriving from the trade secret information will be admissible at trial. (C) Direct access to computer databases containing trade secret information, so-called \"real time\" discovery, shall not be ordered by the court unless the court finds that the proponent of the discovery cannot obtain this information by any other means and provided that the information sought is not subject to any privilege. (D) Upon motion of the holder of the trade secret information, a court may condition the production of trade secret information on the posting of an appropriate bond. (E) Information produced pursuant to this section must be governed by an appropriate written protective order of the court. (F) Information produced pursuant to this section may only be disclosed to persons identified in the written protective order of the court and may be used or disclosed only in the action in which it is produced. Litigation-sharing orders pertaining to trade secret information must not be entered by the court. (G) A person receiving trade secret information pursuant to this section is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State. (H) When information produced pursuant to this section is discussed or otherwise disclosed at a trial or hearing, the owner of the produced trade secret information is allowed to obtain individually signed confidentiality agreements from all parties that are present in the courtroom or are party to any procedures where trade secret information is discussed, presented, or otherwise made known to any party not already under a confidentiality agreement with the trade secret owner. (I) All trade secret information and any copies, duplicates, or other writings which reflect or contain the trade secret information, or excerpts therefrom, must be returned to the holder of the trade secrets at the conclusion of the litigation. (J) This section applies to any civil action brought within or without this State where discovery is sought of trade secret information present in this State.

The protective order may, in the court's discretion, include the following provisions: (1) that the information produced pursuant to this section may be disclosed only to persons identified in the written protective order of the court and may be used or disclosed only in the action in which it is produced; (2) that the defendant may view the secret only in the presence of his counsel or at counsel's office; (3) that a party seeking to show the trade secret, or articles containing the trade secret, to a person not designated by the protective order must first obtain court approval to do so. (a) The court must require that the person receiving the trade secret do so only in the presence of counsel for the party requesting protection. (b) The court must require the person receiving the trade secret to sign a copy of the protective order and a confidentiality agreement with the trade secret owner and to agree to be bound by its terms. The order may include a provision recognizing the owner of the trade secret to be a third-party beneficiary of that agreement. (c) The court shall require a party seeking disclosure to an expert to provide that expert's name, employment history, and any other relevant information to the court for examination. The court must evaluate the expert and determine whether the expert poses a significant risk of compromise. (4) that no articles disclosing the trade secret may be filed or otherwise made a part of the court record available to the public without approval of the court and prior notice to the owner of the secret. The owner of the secret may give permission to accept the notice on the owner's behalf; (5) other orders as the court considers necessary to protect the integrity of the trade secret. (B) During proceedings where trade secrets may be disclosed, the court may, in its discretion, take other appropriate measures to protect against disclosure of trade secrets.
