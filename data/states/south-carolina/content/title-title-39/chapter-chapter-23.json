      "text": "(a) Any drug or device that is adulterated or misbranded when introduced into or while in intrastate commerce or while held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in intrastate commerce, or which may not, under the provisions of Section 39-23-50, be introduced into intrastate commerce, shall be liable to be proceeded against while in intrastate commerce or at any time thereafter, on libel of information and condemned in any circuit court of the State within the jurisdiction of which the article is found; provided, however, that no libel for condemnation shall be instituted under this chapter, for any alleged misbranding if there is pending in any court a libel for condemnation proceeding under this chapter based upon the same alleged misbranding, and not more than one such proceeding shall be instituted if no such proceeding is so pending, except that such limitations shall not apply (1) when such misbranding has been the basis of a prior judgment in favor of the State, in a criminal injunction, or libel for condemnation proceeding under this chapter, or (2) when the Director of Health and Environmental Control has probable cause to believe from facts found, without hearings, by him or any officer or employee of the Department of Health and Environmental Control that the misbranding is dangerous to health, or that the labeling of the misbranded article is fraudulent, or would be in a material respect misleading to injury or damage of the purchaser or consumer. In any case where the number of libel for condemnation proceedings is limited as above provided the proceeding pending or instituted shall, on application of the claimant, reasonably made, be removed for trial to any circuit agreed upon by stipulation between the parties, or, in case of failure to so stipulate within a reasonable time, the claimant may apply to the court of the circuit in which the seizure has been made, and such court (after giving the Attorney General or other attorney for the Department of Health and Environmental Control reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard), shall by order, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, specify a circuit of reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of business to which the case shall be removed for trial.\n\n(b) The article shall be liable to seizure by process pursuant to the libel, and the procedure in cases under this section shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure in admiralty; except that on demand of either party any issue of fact joined in any such case shall be tried by jury. When libel for condemnation proceedings under this section, involving the same claimant and the same issues of adulteration or misbranding, are pending in two or more jurisdictions, such pending proceedings, upon application of the claimant reasonably made to the court of one such jurisdiction, shall be consolidated for trial by order of such court, and tried in (1) any circuit selected by the claimant where one of such proceedings is pending; or (2) a circuit agreed upon by stipulation between the parties. If no order for consolidation is so made within a reasonable time, the claimant may apply to the court of one such jurisdiction, and such court (after giving the Attorney General or other attorney for the Department of Health and Environmental Control reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, specify a circuit of reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of business, in which all pending proceedings shall be consolidated for trial and tried. Such order of consolidation shall not apply so as to require the removal of any case the date for trial of which has been fixed. The court granting such order shall give prompt notification thereof to the other courts having jurisdiction of the cases covered thereby.\n\n(c) The court at any time after seizure up to a reasonable time before trial shall by order allow any party to a condemnation proceeding, his attorney or agent, to obtain a representative sample of the article seized.\n\n(d) Any drug or device condemned under this section shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, direct and the proceeds thereof, if sold, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the State of South Carolina; but such article shall not be sold under such decree contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of the jurisdiction in which sold; provided, that after entry of the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of any state or territory in which sold, the court may by order direct that such article be delivered to the owner thereof to be destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter under the supervision of an officer or employee duly designated by the Director of Health and Environmental Control, and the expenses of such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining release of the article under bond. Any article condemned by reason of its being an article which may not, under Section 39-23-70, be introduced into intrastate commerce, shall be disposed of by destruction.\n\n(e) When a decree of condemnation is entered against the article, court costs of fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article.\n\n(f) In the case of removal for trial of any case as provided by subsection (a) or (b):\n\n(1) The clerk of the court from which removal is made shall promptly transmit to the court in which the case is to be tried all records in the case necessary in order that such court may exercise jurisdiction.\n\n(2) The court to which such case was removed shall have the powers and be subject to the duties, for purposes of such case, which the court from which removal was made would have had, or to which such court would have been subject, if such case had not been removed.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 32-1510.110; 1972 (57) 3046.",
