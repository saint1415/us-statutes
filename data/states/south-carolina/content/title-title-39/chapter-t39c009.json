(2) Warehouse trucks must be of the same weight, and weight needed to bring about this result must be attached permanently by a bolt. The weight must be painted, stenciled, or otherwise conspicuously marked on each truck and also must be posted on the scale or scale house. (3) If the \"even pound\" system is used in the buying and selling of tobacco on the warehouse floor, the nearest \"even pound\" on indicator, dial, or beam must be used. (4) A tolerance not exceeding two pounds on each basket, sheet, or container of tobacco weighing not more than one hundred fifty pounds and a tolerance of four pounds on each basket, sheet, or container of tobacco weighing more than one hundred fifty pounds must be considered a reasonable variation in weight. The variation is allowable only when supported by the facts in each case and applicable to each individual basket, sheet, or container of tobacco. Allowance must not be made for variations in weight on baskets, sheets, or containers erroneously weighed or illegally packed. (5) A buyer of leaf tobacco at auction who makes a claim for an adjusted settlement with a warehouse, based on reweighing done by a licensed weighmaster, shall present his claim in writing to the warehouseman within twenty-four hours after the purchase of the tobacco. A warehouseman may require of the buyer that a claim for an adjusted settlement must be based upon reweights established by the weighmaster who originally weighed the tobacco on scales of tested accuracy.
