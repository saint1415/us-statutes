      "text": "A manufacturer who sells an assistive technology device to a consumer, either directly or through an assistive technology device dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express written warranty for the assistive technology device. At a minimum, the warranty shall guarantee that there are no defects in parts or performance. The duration of the express written warranty must be not less than one year after the first delivery of the assistive technology device to the consumer. In the absence of an express written warranty from the manufacturer, the assistive technology device shall be considered to have been expressly warranted by the manufacturer as if the manufacturer had explicitly furnished the warranty to the consumer as required by this section. All other requirements in this section will govern the product that is statutorily considered expressly warranted. Assistive technology dealers and lessors shall have the right to reimbursement or compensation from the manufacturer or other prior parties in the sales or distribution chain. It is expressly understood that assistive technology devices that are sold in an \"as is\" condition, and is so stated on the bill of sale, carry no warranty unless one is specifically stated on the bill of sale.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 403, Section 1, eff June 8, 1998.",

      "text": "(A) If an assistive technology device does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer (1) reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, the assistive technology device lessor, or any of the manufacturer's authorized assistive technology device dealers and (2) makes the assistive technology device available for repair before one year after first delivery of the assistive technology device to the consumer, the nonconformity must be repaired at the manufacturer's expense to correct the nonconformity regardless of whether the repairs are made after expiration of the warranty rights period. If in any subsequent proceeding it is determined that the repair did not qualify under this chapter and the manufacturer was not otherwise obligated to repair the assistive technology device, the consumer is liable to the manufacturer for costs of repair actually made by the manufacturer.\n\n(B) If after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall accept return of the assistive technology device and:\n\n(1) at the direction of a consumer, as defined in Section 39-54-20(5)(a), (b), or (c), the manufacturer shall do one of the following:\n\n(a) replace the assistive technology device with a comparable assistive technology device and refund collateral costs; or\n\n(b) refund to the consumer and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the consumer's assistive technology device, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price paid plus any finance charges, the amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale, and collateral costs; or\n\n(2) at the direction of a consumer, as defined in Section 39-54-20(5)(d), the manufacturer shall do the following:\n\n(a) refund to the assistive technology device lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive technology device, as their interest may appear, the current value of the written lease. For purposes of this subitem, the current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which that lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination plus the assistive technology device dealer's early termination costs and the value of the assistive technology device at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the assistive technology device lessor's early termination savings; and\n\n(b) return to the consumer the amount the consumer paid under the written lease plus collateral costs.\n\n(C) To receive a comparable new assistive technology device or a refund due under subsection (B)(1), a consumer, as defined in Section 39-54-20(5)(a), (b), or (c), shall offer to transfer possession of the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer of that assistive technology device. No later than thirty days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with a comparable new assistive technology device or a refund. When the manufacturer provides the new assistive technology device or refund, the consumer shall return the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer, along with any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer. A consumer transferring possession of an assistive technology device under this subsection shall transfer possession in the same manner and method that the consumer obtained the device, and if the nonconformity occurs within the warranty period, the manufacturer shall bear the cost of transferring possession of the device.\n\n(D) To receive a refund due under subsection (B)(2):\n\n(1) a consumer, as defined in Section 39-54-20(5)(d), shall offer to return the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer of that assistive technology device. No later than thirty days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the consumer. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the consumer shall return the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer; or\n\n(2) an assistive technology device lessor, as defined in Section 39-54-20(3) shall offer to transfer possession of the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer of that assistive technology device. No later than thirty days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the assistive technology device lessor. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the assistive technology device lessor shall provide any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer and all costs due to the consumer as defined in Section 39-54-20(5)(d).\n\nNo person may enforce the lease against the consumer after the consumer receives the refund due under subsection (B)(2).\n\n(E) No assistive technology device returned by a consumer or assistive technology device lessor in this State under subsection (B) or by a consumer or assistive technology device lessor in another state under a similar law of that state may be sold or leased again in this State unless full disclosure of the reasons for return is made to a prospective buyer or lessee.\n\nHISTORY: 1998 Act No. 403, Section 1, eff June 8, 1998.",
