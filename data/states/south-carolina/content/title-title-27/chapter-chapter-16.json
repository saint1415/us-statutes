If these claims are not resolved, further litigation involving tens of thousands of landowners would be likely.\n\n(3) The Indian claimants and the State, acting through the Governor, have reached an agreement in principle to settle their differences which constitutes a good faith effort on the part of all parties to achieve a fair and just resolution of claims which, in the absence of this settlement, could be pursued through the courts for many years to the detriment of the State and all its citizens, including the Indians.\n\n(4) The implementation of the settlement requires legislation by the Congress of the United States and by the General Assembly of South Carolina.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 142, Section 1.",

      "text": "(A) The Tribe may provide in its constitution for a Tribal Court having civil jurisdiction which may extend up to, but not exceed, the extent provided in this chapter and the federal implementing legislation. The Tribe may have a court of original jurisdiction, as well as an appellate court.\n\n(1) With respect to actions on contracts, the Tribal Court may be vested with jurisdiction over an action on a contract:\n\n(a) to which the Tribe or a member of the Tribe is a party, which expressly provides in writing that the Tribal Court has concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n(b) between the Tribe or a member of the Tribe and other parties or their agents who are physically present on the Reservation when the contract is made, and which is to be performed in part on the Reservation so long as the contract does not expressly exclude jurisdiction of the Tribal Court. For purposes of this section, the delivery of goods or the solicitation of business on the Reservation does not constitute part performance sufficient to confer jurisdiction.\n\n(c) to which the Tribe or a member of the Tribe is a party where more than fifty percent of the services to be rendered are performed on the Reservation, so long as the contract does not expressly exclude jurisdiction of the Tribal Court.\n\n(2) With respect to actions in tort, the Tribal Court may be vested with jurisdiction over an action arising out of:\n\n(a) an intentional tort, as defined by South Carolina law, committed on the Reservation, in which recovery is sought for bodily injuries or damages to tangible property located on the Reservation.\n\n(b) negligent tortious conduct occurring on the Reservation or conduct occurring on the Reservation for which strict liability may be imposed, excluding, however, accidents occurring within the right-of-way limits of a highway, road, or other public easement owned or maintained by the State or its subdivisions or by the United States, which abuts or crosses the Reservation. However, the action in tort involving a nonmember of the Tribe as defendant may be removed to a state or federal court of appropriate jurisdiction if the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limits then applicable to magistrate's court in South Carolina.\n\n(3) The Tribal Court may be vested with exclusive jurisdiction over internal matters of the Tribe.\n\n(4) The Tribal Court also may be vested with jurisdiction over domestic relations where both spouses to the marriage are members of the Tribe and both reside on the Reservation or last resided together on the Reservation before the separation leading to their divorce.\n\n(5) The Tribal Court also may be vested with jurisdiction to enforce against a business located on the Reservation and members or nonmembers residing on the Reservation, tribal civil regulations regulating conduct on the Reservation enacted pursuant to Section 10.2 or 17 of the Settlement Agreement. The entity or person is charged with notice of the Tribe's regulations governing conduct on the Reservation and is subject to the enforcement of the regulations in the Tribal Court unless the Tribe specifically has exempted the entity or person from any or all regulation or enforcement in Tribal Court.\n\n(B) The original jurisdiction of the Tribal Court over the matters set forth in subsections (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c), (A)(2), and (A)(4) must be concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas of South Carolina, the Family Court, and the United States District Court for South Carolina. The original jurisdiction of the Tribal Court over the matters set forth in subsection (A)(1)(a) must be concurrent or exclusive depending upon the agreement of the parties. The original jurisdiction of the Tribal Court over matters set forth in subsection (A)(3) must be exclusive. The original jurisdiction of the Tribal Court over matters set forth in subsection (A)(5) must be exclusive unless the Tribe has waived exclusive jurisdiction as to any person or entity. As to all sections referred to in this subsection, jurisdiction over appeals, if any, must be governed by subsection (D).\n\n(C) The Tribe may waive Tribal Court jurisdiction or the application of tribal laws with respect to a person or firm residing, doing business, or otherwise entering upon the Reservation or contracting with the Tribe. A member of the Tribe also may waive Tribal Court jurisdiction or specify in the contract the law of an appropriate jurisdiction to govern a commercial transaction or the interpretation of a contract to which the member is a party.\n\n(D)(1) All final judgments entered in actions tried in Tribal Court are subject to an appeal to the Family Court, the Court of Common Pleas, or the United States District Court, depending upon whether that court would have had jurisdiction over the appealed matter had it been commenced in that court, if all of the following circumstances exist:\n\n(a) A party to the suit is not a member of the Tribe;\n\n(b) The amount in controversy or the cost of complying with an equitable order or decree exceeds the jurisdictional limits then applicable in the magistrates' courts of South Carolina;\n\n(c) The subject matter of the suit does not fall within subsection (A)(1)(a) if jurisdiction is exclusive or subsection (A)(3) or (A)(5). The Tribe may enlarge the right of appeal to include other subject matters and members of the Tribe, subject to rules and procedures the applicable court and relevant state laws may provide.\n\n(2) In an appeal, the court, as appropriate, may:\n\n(a) enter judgment affirming the Tribal Court;\n\n(b) dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, but only in those cases where the Tribal Court first has addressed the issue of its jurisdiction;\n\n(c) reverse or remand the case for retrial or reconsideration in Tribal Court; or\n\n(d) grant a trial de novo in its court.\n\n(3) In an appeal, a trial, or a trial de novo, the reviewing court shall apply any regulation enacted pursuant to tribal authority.\n\n(E)(1) In cases subject to subsection (A)(2) or (D), all final judgments of the Tribal Court must be given full faith and credit in the state court with appropriate jurisdiction, and the Tribal Court shall grant full faith and credit to state court final judgments.\n\n(2) In those cases which are not subject to subsection (A)(2) or (D), the judgment must be reviewed by the state court in the manner provided in the Uniform Arbitration Act, Section 15-48-10 et. seq. or, if appropriate, by the federal court in the manner provided in the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et. seq.\n\n(F)(1) The Tribe may sue or be sued, in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, the Tribe enjoys sovereign immunity including damage limits and, except as provided in this subsection, immunity from seizure, execution, or encumbrance of properties, to the same extent as the political subdivisions of the State as provided in the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, Chapter 78 of Title 15. With respect to nonconsumer liability based on contract, however, the Tribe, in a written contract, may provide that it is immune from suit on that contract as if there had been no waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the Tribe is subject to suit as provided in Section 27-16-120(B).\n\n(3) The Tribe shall procure and maintain liability insurance with the same coverage and limits as required of political subdivisions of the State by Section 15-78-140(b).\n\n(4) An action alleging tortious conduct by an employee of the Tribe acting within the scope of his duties which seeks money damages against the Tribe must name only the Tribe as a party defendant.\n\n(5) A settlement or judgment in an action or a settlement of a claim filed with the Tribe constitutes a complete bar to further action by the claimant against the Tribe by reason of the same occurrence.\n\n(6) A claimant may file a verified claim for damages with the Tribe before filing suit but is not required to file the claim as a prerequisite to filing suit.\n\n(a) The claim must set forth the circumstances which brought about the loss, the extent of the loss, the time and the place the loss occurred, the names of all witnesses, if known, and the amount of the loss sustained.\n\n(b) The Tribe shall designate an employee or office to accept the filing of claims. Filing may be accomplished by receipt by the Tribe's designee of certified mailing of the claims or by compliance with the provisions of law relating to service of process.\n\n(c) If filed, the claim must be received within one year after the loss was or should have been discovered.\n\n(d) The Tribe has one hundred eighty days from the date of the filing of the claim in which to determine whether the claim is allowed or disallowed. Failure to notify the claimant of action upon the claim within one hundred eighty days after the filing of the claim is considered a disallowance of the claim.\n\n(e) While the filing of the claim is not required as a prerequisite to suit, if a claimant files a claim, he may not institute an action until after the occurrence of the earliest of one of the following three events:\n\n(i) passage of one hundred eighty days from the filing of the claim with the Tribe;\n\n(ii) Tribe's disallowance of the claim;\n\n(iii) Tribe's rejection of a settlement offer.\n\n(7) The provisions of the following sections of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act apply to the Tribe to the same extent as they apply to the State and its political subdivisions:\n\n(a) Section 15-78-100(c), joint tortfeasors;\n\n(b) Section 15-78-110, statute of limitations;\n\n(c) Section 15-78-170, survival actions;\n\n(d) Section 15-78-190, applicability of uninsured or underinsured defendant insurance.\n\n(8) If the Tribe's insurance coverage is inadequate or unavailable to satisfy a judgment within the limits of the Tort Claims Act, neither the judgment nor any other process may be levied upon the corpus or principal of the Tribal Trust Funds or upon property held in trust for the Tribe by the United States. However, the Tribe or the Secretary of Interior shall honor valid orders of a federal or state court which enters money judgments for causes of action against the Tribe arising after the effective date of this chapter, by making an assignment to the judgment creditor of the right to receive income out of the next quarterly payment or payments of income from the Tribal Trust Funds.\n\n(G) The Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Section 1901 et seq., applies to Catawba Indian Children as set forth in the federal implementing legislation.\n\n(H) If no Tribal Court is established by the Tribe, the State shall exercise jurisdiction over all civil and criminal causes arising out of acts and transactions occurring on the Reservation or involving members of the Tribe. If the Tribe does establish a Tribal Court pursuant to Section 27-16-70(B) or 27-16-80(A), Section 27-16-70(B)(2) or 27-16-80 (B) governs whether jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 142, Section 1.",

This Expanded Reservation must be joined with the Existing Reservation to form the new tribal Reservation.\n\n(1)(a) The total area of the Reservation is limited to three thousand acres, including the Existing Reservation, but the Tribe may exclude from this limit up to six hundred acres of additional land if the land is:\n\n(i) within rights-of-way for public roads or public utilities rendered unusable for development by the easement or right-of-way;\n\n(ii) within the one hundred-year flood plain of the Catawba River as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or its successor;\n\n(iii) nondevelopable wetland defined or restricted by law or regulation so that buildings, structures, and other improvements are prohibited;\n\n(iv) park or recreational land accessible to the public and dedicated permanently to public use.\n\n(b) After completion of a comprehensive development plan the Tribe may seek to have the permissible area of the Expanded Reservation enlarged to a maximum of three thousand, six hundred acres, plus up to six hundred acres of land as described in subitem (a). Expansion must be approved first, however, by the Secretary and then by ordinance of the county council governing the area where the additional lands are to be acquired and by a law or joint resolution enacted by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor of South Carolina.\n\n(2) Before placing a noncontiguous tract in Reservation status, the Tribe, in consultation with the Secretary, shall submit to the county council in a county where it proposes to purchase noncontiguous tracts for Reservation status a Noncontiguous Development Plan Application. As used in this item 'application' is as described in the Settlement Agreement.\n\n(3) The Tribe shall present its application to the county council of each county in which the Secretary proposes to purchase noncontiguous tracts to be placed in Reservation status. The county council shall make findings on the extent to which the application has met the criteria set forth in the Settlement Agreement and recommend to the Governor whether or not the application should be approved. After receiving the county council's recommendation, the Tribe may modify its application and resubmit it to the county council or present it to the Governor for approval. Giving due deference to the recommendation of the county council, the Governor shall review the application and decide whether to approve or disapprove it on the basis of the criteria set forth in the Settlement Agreement. Neither the county council's approval nor the Governor's approval may be withheld unreasonably. The Governor's final action must be accompanied by a written statement of reasons and is reviewable under the laws of the State.\n\n(4) Upon approval by the Governor of the Tribe's Application, the Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe, may proceed to place noncontiguous tracts in Reservation status in accordance with the application, this chapter, and the terms of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n(C) The Secretary and the Tribe shall endeavor at the outset to acquire contiguous tracts for the expanded Reservation in the area referred to in the Settlement Agreement as the \"Primary Expansion Zone\". The Primary Expansion Zone lies within the area bounded by S. C. Highway No. 5 on the south running northwesterly to its intersection with Springdale Road on the west and northeasterly to the Catawba River along Sturgis Road; east along the Catawba River to its confluence with Sugar Creek; north along Sugar Creek to its intersection with S. C. Highway No. S-29-41, Doby Bridge Road; with S. C. Highway S-29-41 to its intersection with U.S. Highway No. 521; with U.S. Highway No. 521 in a southerly direction to its intersection with S. C. Highway No. S-29-55, Van Wyck Road, on the east; with S. C. Highway No. S-29-55 to its intersection with Twelve Mile Creek on the south; and with Twelve Mile Creek to S. C. Highway No. 5 on the south. This area is known as the \"Catawba Reservation Primary Expansion Zone\".\n\n(D) The Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe, may elect to purchase contiguous tracts in an alternative area described in the Settlement Agreement as the Secondary Expansion Zone, under the conditions provided in subsections (B)(2) and (3). The Secondary Expansion Zone consists of the area bounded by Sugar Creek on the west; the Catawba River on the south extending to the Norfolk Southern Railway trestle on the west; northerly with the railroad right-of-way to its intersection with S.C. S-46-329, Brickyard Road; east to S.C. S-46-41, Doby Bridge Road; easterly along S.C. S-46-41 to its intersection with Sugar Creek. This area is known as the \"Catawba Reservation Secondary Expansion Zone\".\n\n(E) The Primary and Secondary Expansion Zones in subsections (C) and (D) are the preferred and only approved zones for expansion of the Reservation. However, after completing a comprehensive plan of development, the Tribe may propose different or additional expansion zones. The zone first must be approved by the Secretary, then by ordinance of the county council where the zone is located, and by law or joint resolution enacted by the General Assembly of South Carolina and signed by the Governor. The combined area of all land acquisitions, including land in specially approved zones, may not exceed the limits imposed by this section.\n\n(F) Before the Tribe's comprehensive planning process, the South Carolina Department of Highways and Public Transportation shall consult with the Tribe about planned and proposed major highways within the Primary and Secondary Expansion Zones in the manner described in the Settlement Agreement.\n\n(G) Before the Tribe's comprehensive planning process, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control shall consult with the Tribe about the location of future sewage treatment facilities that may serve the Primary and Secondary Expansion Zones in the manner described in the Settlement Agreement. The Tribe is responsible for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of its own sewage collection system and for the cost of constructing an extension line and tap to the transmission line. The Tribe also is subject to fees for use of the treatment system and transmission line and subject to all regulations imposed on users of the system. The Department of Health and Environmental Control shall endeavor to ensure that the fees, charges, and rules are the same as those applied to municipal users of the system. If the Tribe is required to construct an extension line to connect with a transmission line, the Tribe may charge non-Reservation users along the extension line reasonable tap and user fees.\n\n(H) Except as provided in this subsection, the power of eminent domain must not be used by a governmental authority in acquiring parcels of land for the benefit of the Tribe, whether or not the parcels are to be part of the Reservation. All purchases may be made only from willing sellers by voluntary conveyances, except if the ostensible owner agrees to the sale, the Secretary may use condemnation proceedings to perfect or clear title and to acquire any interests of putative defendants whose addresses are unknown or the interests of unborn heirs or persons subject to mental disability. For South Carolina income tax purposes, the conveyance must be treated in the manner provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 1033 if the federal implementing legislation provides for that treatment under federal law. Filing and recording fees, all documentary tax stamps, and other fees incident to the conveyance of real estate are payable in connection with the purchases regardless of whether the property is purchased by the Tribe or by the United States in trust for the Tribe. Real property taxes levied for the year of closing must be prorated and paid at closing, or if the amount of property taxes to be due then cannot be calculated, property taxes must be estimated and escrowed at closing.\n\n(I) The purchase of land specially assessed as agricultural use property by York or Lancaster County shall not result in a rollback of property taxes if the property is placed by the Tribe in Reservation status within one year of the date of purchase. If specially assessed land is acquired and not made part of the Reservation within one year, deferred or rollback taxes are due and payable without interest to the county treasurer.\n\n(J) The acquisition of lands for the expanded Reservation may not extinguish easements or rights-of-way then encumbering the lands unless the Secretary or the Tribe enters into a written agreement with the owners terminating the easements or rights-of-way. The Secretary, with the approval of the Tribe, has the power to grant or convey easements and rights-of-way for public roads, public utilities, and other public purposes over the Reservation. Unless the Tribe and the State agree upon a valuation formula for pricing easements over the Reservation, the Secretary is subject to proceedings for condemnation and eminent domain to acquire easements and rights-of-way for public purposes through the Reservation under the laws of South Carolina in circumstances where no other reasonable access is available. With the approval of the Tribe, the Secretary also may grant easements or rights-of-way over the Reservation for private purposes, and implied easements of necessity apply to all lands acquired by the Tribe, unless expressly excluded by the parties.\n\n(K) Only land made part of the Reservation is governed by the special jurisdictional provisions set forth in this chapter and in the federal implementing legislation.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 142, Section 1.",

Based on the Tribe's election, the Tribe may be licensed by the South Carolina Department of Revenue to conduct games of bingo under a regular license allowed nonprofit organizations or under the special license provided by this section.\n\n(C) The Tribe may apply to the South Carolina Department of Revenue for a special bingo license in lieu of licenses authorized by Article 24, Chapter 21 of Title 12. A special or regular license must be granted if the Tribe complies with licensing requirements and procedures. The special license is identical in all respects to the class of license permitting the highest level of prizes allowed by law and carries the same privileges and duties as the class of license permitting the highest level of prizes provided by law, except:\n\n(1) The frequency of the sessions must be determined by the executive committee but must be no more frequent than six sessions a week, with sessions on Sundays prohibited unless state law otherwise expressly allows Sunday sessions.\n\n(2) The amount of prizes offered each session must be determined by the Tribe, but must not be greater than one hundred thousand dollars for any game.\n\n(3) The Tribe shall pay, in lieu of an admission, a head, a license, or any other bingo tax, a special bingo tax equal to ten percent for each dollar of face value for each bingo card sold. No other federal, state, or local taxes apply to revenues generated by the bingo games operated by the Tribe. All revenues derived from the special bingo tax must be collected by the South Carolina Department of Revenue and deposited with the State Treasurer for the benefit of the General Fund of South Carolina.\n\n(4) At least fifty percent of the gross proceeds received by the Tribe during a calendar quarter must be returned to the players in the form of prizes.

If the Tribe elects to operate one or both of the games off the Reservation but within the one hundred forty-four thousand acre Catawba Claim Area, it shall do so in an area zoned compatibly for commercial activities after consulting with the municipality or county where a facility is to be located.\n\n(E) The sponsor and promoter of the bingo games is the Catawba Indian Tribe, and all profits gained from the enterprise accrue to the Tribe. The South Carolina Department of Revenue, or its regulatory successor, has the power to administer, oversee, and regulate all bingo games sponsored and conducted by the Tribe, audit and enforce the operation of the games, and assess and collect taxes, interest, and penalties in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State as they apply to the Tribe. The South Carolina Department of Revenue, or its regulatory successor, has the right to suspend or revoke the Tribe's bingo license or special bingo license if the Tribe violates the law with regard to conducting the game. However, the Department of Revenue, or its regulatory successor, first shall notify the Tribe of violations and provide the Tribe with an opportunity to correct the violations before its license may be revoked. Failure to pay bingo taxes, interest, or penalties may be grounds for license revocation.\n\n(F) A license of the Tribe to conduct bingo must be revoked if the game of bingo is no longer licensed by the State. If the State resumes licensing the game of bingo, the Tribe's license or special license must be reinstated if the Tribe complies with all licensing requirements and procedures.\n\n(G) The Tribe may permit on its Reservation video poker or similar electronic play devices to the same extent that the devices are authorized by state law. The Tribe is subject to all taxes, license requirements, regulations, and fees governing electronic play devices provided by state law, except if the Reservation is located in a county or counties which prohibit the devices pursuant to state law, the Tribe nonetheless must be permitted to operate the devices on the Reservation if the governing body of the Tribe so authorizes, subject to all taxes, license requirements, regulations, and fees governing electronic play devices provided by state law.\n\n(H) If the Tribe elects to sponsor and conduct games of bingo under a regular license allowed nonprofit organizations under Article 24, Chapter 21 of Title 12, the Tribe must be taxed as a nonprofit corporation under that article.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 142, Section 1; 1998 Act No. 334, Section 2.",

Tribal regulations also do not apply to activities or uses off the Reservation, even if those activities affect air quality on the Reservation.\n\n(3) The Tribe is not authorized to invoke sovereign immunity against a suit, a proceeding, or an enforcement action involving state or local environmental laws or regulations and is subject to all enforcement orders, restraining orders, fees, fines, injunctions, judgments, and other corrective or remedial measures imposed by the laws.

The Tribe has the authority to impose hunting, fishing, and wildlife rules and regulations on the Reservation that are stricter than those adopted by the State.\n\n(F) The littoral and riparian rights of the Catawba Indian Tribe in the Catawba River or in other streams or waters crossing their lands do not differ in any respect from the rights of other owners whose land abuts nontidal bodies of water or nontidal water courses in South Carolina. The rights and obligations covered by this subsection include, but are not limited to, those described in the Settlement Agreement. These qualifications apply to the Existing Reservation, lands acquired for the Expanded Reservation, other lands acquired by or for the benefit of the Tribe, and non-Reservation lands.\n\n(G) Alcohol is prohibited on the Reservation unless the Tribe adopts laws or ordinances permitting the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol on the Reservation. If the Tribe adopts the laws or ordinances, they must incorporate all state standards and regulations regarding hours, sales to minors, employment, consumption, possession, and standards for licensing.
