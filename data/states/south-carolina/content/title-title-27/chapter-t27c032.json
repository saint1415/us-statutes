If you decide to cancel this contract, you must notify (name of resale service provider) in writing of your intent to cancel. Your notice of cancellation must be effective upon the date sent and must be sent to (resale service provider's mailing address) or to (resale service provider's e-mail address). Your refund will be made within twenty days after receipt of notice of cancellation or within five days after receipt of funds from your cleared check, whichever is later. You are not obligated to pay (name of resale service provider) any money unless you sign this contract and return it to (name of resale service provider). Before signing this contract, you should carefully review your original vacation time sharing purchase contract and other project documents to determine whether there are any restrictions or special conditions applicable to the resale or rental of your vacation time sharing interest. You also may wish to contact your resort management company or your vacation time sharing association to learn about resale or rental options that may be available to you.\" (B) With respect to all fees, costs and compensation paid to a resale service provider, the following shall apply: (1) A consumer vacation time sharing reseller may not be charged an appraisal fee in connection with the sale or rental of a resale vacation time sharing interest. (2) A consumer vacation time sharing reseller may be charged marketing or advertising fees prior to the sale or rental of a resale vacation time sharing interest.

(ii) The escrow agent's submission of the affidavit and a notice of right to dispute the release of funds or property in escrow to the consumer vacation time sharing reseller. The notice shall state the consumer vacation time sharing reseller shall have five business days after receipt of such affidavit to submit a written dispute to the escrow agent that all promised vacation time sharing resale services have in fact not been fully performed by the resale service provider. The consumer vacation time sharing reseller may submit the dispute by electronic mail or regular mail. The dispute is effective upon the date sent. (iii) Failure of the consumer vacation time sharing reseller to submit a dispute pursuant to subsubitem (ii). (iv) Should the escrow agent receive conflicting demands for funds or other property held in escrow, the escrow agent immediately must notify the commission of the dispute and either promptly submit the matter to arbitration or, by interpleader or otherwise, seek an adjudication of the matter by court. (b) The commission may audit or examine the escrow account.

(2) Failure to pay assessments or taxes that are due or that come due within four years after acquisition of a resale vacation time sharing interest by a transferee who acquires the resale vacation time sharing interest for commercial purposes and not for personal use and enjoyment creates a rebuttable presumption of a violation of this section. (3) Payment of all assessments and taxes for four years by or on behalf of a transferee shall satisfy item (2). (4) It is considered a violation of this section if there is any transfer, series of transfers, or other action made or taken by any person for the purpose of circumventing this section. (D) No individual consumer vacation time sharing reseller who sells or transfers five or fewer resale vacation time sharing interests owned by that consumer vacation time sharing reseller in a given calendar year shall be subject to liability under subsection (C) above. (E) Engagement in any vacation time sharing resale service, or receipt of consideration in connection with, any vacation time sharing resale service without an executed written contract as provided in this section or the transfer of a resale vacation time sharing interest to a person who the resale service provider knows or should have known has demonstrated a pattern of nonpayment of assessments, taxes, or fees associated with the obligations of ownership, creates a rebuttable presumption of this as a violation of this section. (F) Providing vacation time sharing resale services with respect to a consumer resale vacation time sharing interest in a vacation time sharing property located or offered within this State or required to be registered in this State, including acting as an agent or third-party service provider for a resale service provider, constitutes operating, conducting, engaging in, or carrying on a business or business venture in this State.

The criminal penalty provisions of Chapter 5, Title 39 do not apply to this section. (2) If a court, in its discretion, based upon the evidence presented by the parties, determines that a person's actions pursuant to this section were inadvertent, unintentional, and not an effort to violate the provisions of this section, the court may hold that the person's actions were nonmaterial, technical violations not subject to Chapter 5, Title 39 of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, and in lieu of all other penalties, the court may assess a technical violation penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars. The court's determination that a violation is a nonmaterial, technical violation in no way prevents the court from assessing full penalties under this section or Chapter 5, Title 39 of the Unfair Trade Practices Act for any other violations determined to be a plan or scheme. (I) The Department of Consumer Affairs may enforce this section, and impose penalties, including those provided in Section 27-32-120(A), a warning notice of deficiency, a cease and desist order and a refund of fees, costs or compensation assessed and/or received in violation of the section. A person aggrieved by the department's final administrative order may request a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court pursuant to the court's rules of procedure. If the person fails to timely request a contested case hearing, the department may bring an action to enforce its order pursuant to Chapter 23, Title 1. The criminal penalty provisions of Section 27-32-120(B) do not apply to this section. (J) Vacation time sharing interests are subject to the protections of the Service Members Civil Relief Act.

The seller shall provide adequate assurances to the commission that all interests conveyed to purchasers in accommodations and facilities, and the accommodations and facilities themselves, shall remain unencumbered excepting only tax liens, owners' association assessments, encumbrances including mortgage liens which are subordinate to the vacation time sharing plan or other encumbrances arising from the purchaser's actions, and purchase money mortgages, contracts for deed, or similar purchase money security interests arising from transactions in which the purchasers acquired their interests. Those assurances may consist of bonds, nondisturbance instruments, and recorded instruments advising third parties of the existence of purchaser use rights and providing for subordination of future liens. For those plans in which an interest in accommodations and facilities is not conveyed, the commission may require either a cash or surety bond, or both, in an amount up to but not to exceed a combined total of two hundred fifty thousand dollars. (2) Within thirty days from the date the commission receives an application for registration, the commission must enter an order registering the vacation time sharing plan or rejecting the registration. If an order of rejection is not entered within thirty days from the date of application, the vacation time sharing plan is considered registered unless the applicant has consented in writing to a delay. A reasonable request for an extension of time by the commission must not be withheld. (a) If the commission affirmatively determines, upon inquiry and examination, that the requirements of this chapter have been met, it must enter an order registering the plan. (b) If the commission determines, upon inquiry and examination, that any of the requirements of this chapter have not been met, the commission must notify the applicant that the application for registration must be corrected in the particulars specified within fifteen days. The commission has the discretion to grant a longer period of time for the applicant to make the required corrections. If the requirements are not met within the time allowed, the commission must enter an order rejecting the registration and including the findings of fact upon which the order is based. The order rejecting the registration is not effective for twenty days during which the applicant may petition for reconsideration and must be granted a hearing. (c) If it appears that a person, company, or a business organization has engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a violation of a provision of this chapter or any rule or order under it, the commission, through the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, with or without prior administrative proceedings, may bring an action in the circuit court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under it. The commission must notify, whenever practicable, a person or business violating this chapter before recourse in the circuit court. Upon proper showing, injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders may be granted, and a receiver or conservator may be appointed. Neither the commission nor the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation is required to post bond in a court proceeding.

Before issuing the temporary cease and desist order, the commission, whenever possible by telephone or otherwise, must give notice to the seller of the proposal to issue a cease and desist order. Each temporary cease and desist order must include in its terms a provision that, upon request, a hearing must be held promptly to determine whether or not the order becomes permanent; (7) revoke a registration of a vacation time sharing plan if, after notice and hearing upon a written finding of fact, the commission determines that the seller has: (a) failed to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order; (b) been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, after the filing of the application for registration, of a crime involving fraud, deception, false pretenses, misrepresentation, false advertising, or dishonest dealing; (c) disposed of, concealed, or diverted funds or assets of a person so as to defeat the rights of vacation time sharing plan purchasers; (d) failed to faithfully perform any stipulation or agreement made with the commission as an inducement to grant a registration, to reinstate a registration, or to approve any promotional plan or advertisement; or (e) made intentional misrepresentations or concealed material facts in an application for registration; and (8) issue a cease and desist order instead of revoking a registration if it finds, after notice and hearing, that the seller has been guilty of a violation for which revocation could be ordered.

(2) The envelope must be placed in the mail as certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. (3) Notice under this section is considered perfected upon the signing of the return receipt by a person at the notice address. (B) If the certified or registered mail sent pursuant to subsection (A) is returned with an endorsement or stamp showing \"refused\", the trustee may send the notice by first class mail to the notice address. The failure to claim certified or registered mail is not refusal of notice within the meaning of this subsection. Notice pursuant to this subsection must be delivered as follows: (1) the trustee must place a copy of the notice of default and intent to sell in a sealed envelope with adequate postage addressed to the obligor, the record owner of the timeshare estate if different from the obligor, and any junior interest holders; (2) the envelope must be mailed by first class mail with the return address of the trustee on the envelope; (3) notice under this subsection is considered perfected upon the mailing of the envelope. (C) If notice is perfected under subsection (A), the trustee must file an affidavit setting forth the manner of notice as part of the certificate of compliance set forth in Section 27-32-340. The affidavit must state the nature of the process, the date on which the process was mailed by certified or registered mail, the name and address on the envelope containing the notice, the fact that the notice was mailed certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, the name of the person who signed the return receipt, if known, and the basis for that knowledge. The return receipt from the certified or registered mail must be attached to the affidavit. (D) If notice is perfected under subsection (B), the trustee must file an affidavit setting forth the manner of notice as part of the certificate of compliance set forth in Section 27-32-340. The affidavit must state the nature of the notice, the date on which the notice was mailed by certified or registered mail, the name and address on the envelope containing the notice, the fact that the notice was mailed certified or registered mail and was returned with the endorsement or stamped \"refused\", the date, if known, on which the notice was \"refused\", the date on which the notice was mailed by first class mail, the name and address on the envelope containing the notice that was mailed by first class mail, and the fact that the notice was mailed by first class mail with the return address of the trustee on the envelope. The return envelope from the attempt to mail notice by certified or registered mail and the return envelope, if any, from the attempt to mail the envelope by first class mail must be attached to the affidavit. (E) If the trustee is unable to perfect notice pursuant to either subsection (A) or subsection (B) because the copy of the notice mailed by certified or registered mail is returned by the United States Post Office as \"undeliverable\" or for any other reason and if by a diligent search and inquiry the trustee cannot obtain a different address for the obligor for service required by subsection (A), the trustee may perfect notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the timeshare estate is located. The notice must appear once a week for two successive weeks. A copy of the notice must be sent to the obligor by first class mail to the notice address of the obligor and to any other address of the obligor obtained through the trustee's diligent search and inquiry. If notice is perfected by publication under this subsection, the trustee must attach an affidavit of publication to the certificate of compliance set forth in Section 27-32-340 and must state that the notice was perfected by publication after diligent search and inquiry was made for the obligor's address, attaching the returned envelope with the notation from the United States Post Office. No other action of the trustee is necessary to perfect notice. If the diligent search and inquiry has produced an address different from the notice address, that address may be used in lieu of the notice address of the obligor for subsequent mailings required under this article.

      "text": "(A) Unless the timeshare declaration provides a lower percentage, the vote or written consent, or both, of sixty percent of all eligible voting interests in a vacation time sharing plan may terminate the term of the vacation time sharing plan at any time. If a vacation time sharing plan is terminated pursuant to this section, the termination has immediate effect as if the effective date of the termination were the original date of termination. (B) If the vacation time sharing property is managed by a vacation time sharing association that is separate from any underlying owners' association, the termination of a vacation time sharing plan does not change the corporate status of the vacation time sharing association. The vacation time sharing association continues to exist only for the purposes of concluding its affairs, prosecuting and defending actions by or against it, collecting and discharging obligations, disposing of and conveying its property, collecting and dividing its assets, and otherwise complying with this section. (C) After termination of a vacation time sharing plan, the board of directors of the vacation time sharing association shall serve as the termination trustee, as the entity empowered to implement the termination of the vacation time sharing plan, and in this fiduciary capacity may bring an action in partition on behalf of the tenants in common in each former vacation time sharing property or sell the former vacation time sharing property in a manner and to a person who is approved by a majority of all tenants in common. The termination trustee also has all other powers reasonably necessary to effect the partition or sale of the former vacation time sharing property, including the power to maintain the property during the pendency of a partition action or sale. (D) All reasonable expenses incurred by the termination trustee relating to the performance of its duties pursuant to this section, including the reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals, must be paid by the tenants in common of the former vacation time sharing property subject to partition or sale, proportionate to their respective ownership interests. (E) The termination trustee shall adopt reasonable procedures to implement the partition or sale of the former vacation time sharing property and comply with the requirements of this section. (F) If the terminated vacation time sharing plan is in an underlying subdivision that is not simultaneously terminated, a majority of the tenants in common in each former accommodation present and voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of the tenants in common conducted by the termination trustee, or conducted by the board of directors of the underlying owners' association, if the underlying owners' association managed the former vacation time sharing property, shall designate a voting representative for the former accommodation and file a voting certificate with the underlying owners' association. The voting representative may vote on all matters at meetings of the underlying owners' association, including termination of the underlying subdivision. (G) Unless the timeshare declaration specifically provides for a lower quorum, the quorum for a vacation time sharing association meeting to consider termination of the vacation time sharing plan is fifty percent of all eligible voting interests in the vacation time sharing plan. (H) The board of directors of the vacation time sharing association may determine that a voting interest that is delinquent in the payment of more than two years of assessments is ineligible to consent to or vote on any termination of the vacation time sharing plan unless the delinquency is paid in full before the consent or vote. A voting interest determined to be ineligible by the board of directors must be subtracted from the total percentage or number of all voting interests required to consent to or vote to approve the termination of the vacation time sharing plan and must not be considered for any purpose, including the percentage or number of voting interests necessary to constitute a quorum. (I) A proxy for a vote to terminate a vacation time sharing plan pursuant to this section is valid for up to three years and is revocable unless the proxy states it is irrevocable.
