Each member must have:\n\n(1) a baccalaureate or more advanced degree from:\n\n(a) a recognized institution of higher learning requiring face-to-face contact between its students and instructors prior to completion of the academic program;\n\n(b) an institution of higher learning that has been accredited by a regional or national accrediting body; or\n\n(c) an institution of higher learning chartered before 1962; and\n\n(2) a background of substantial duration and an expertise in at least one of the following:\n\n(a) energy issues;\n\n(b) telecommunications issues;\n\n(c) consumer protection and advocacy issues;\n\n(d) water and wastewater issues;\n\n(e) finance, economics, and statistics;\n\n(f) accounting;\n\n(g) engineering; or\n\n(B)(1) Beginning in 2004, the members of the Public Service Commission must be elected to staggered terms. In 2004, the members representing the Second, Fourth, and Sixth Congressional Districts must be elected for terms ending on June 30, 2006, and until their successors are elected and qualify. Thereafter, members representing the Second, Fourth, and Sixth Congressional Districts must be elected to terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualify. In 2004, the members representing the First, Third, and Fifth Congressional Districts and the State at large must be elected for terms ending on June 30, 2008, and until their successors are elected and qualify. Thereafter, members representing the First, Third, and Fifth Congressional Districts and the State at large must be elected to terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualify. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, members representing the First, Third, and Fifth Congressional Districts shall serve until the expiration of their terms, and in 2013, members representing the First, Third, and Fifth Congressional Districts must be elected for terms ending on June 30, 2016, and until their successors are elected and qualified.\n\n(2) In the event there are Seven Congressional Districts, the member elected from the State at large shall serve until the expiration of his term, and in 2013, a member representing the Seventh Congressional District must be elected for a term ending on June 30, 2016, and until his successor is elected and qualified.

If the number of congressional districts is less than seven, additional members must be elected at large to provide for a seven-member commission. In the event the congressional districts established by the General Assembly are under review by a court for compliance with statutory or constitutional requirements, an election scheduled pursuant to this section shall not be held until a final determination is made by the courts regarding the congressional districts. The inability to hold an election due to judicial review of the congressional districts does not constitute a vacancy on the commission and the commissioners serve until their successors are elected and qualify.\n\n(D) The Governor may fill vacancies in the office of commissioner until the successor in the office for a full term or an unexpired term, as applicable, has been elected by the General Assembly. In cases where a vacancy occurs on the commission when the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may fill the vacancy by an interim appointment. The Governor must report the interim appointment to the General Assembly and must forward a formal appointment at its next ensuing regular session.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 58-52; 1952 Code Section 58-52; 1942 Code Section 8200; 1932 Code Section 8244; 1922 (32) 956; 1932 (37) 1380; 1935 (39) 25; 1935 (48) 323; 1979 Act No. 167, Section 3, eff July 1, 1979; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1549, eff July 1, 1993; 1994 Act No. 493, Section 1, eff in the election cycle of 1998 and upon approval of the Governor (approved July 14, 1994); 2004 Act No. 175, Section 4, eff February 18, 2004, as to subsections (A), (B), (C), (D), (F); 2004 Act No. 175, Section 4, eff July 1, 2004, as to subsection (E); 2012 Act No. 279, Section 25, eff June 26, 2012; 2022 Act No. 220 (H.4062), Section 2, eff May 23, 2022.",
