      "text": "In order to activate a regional transportation authority the following steps must be taken: (1) A plan of service must be prepared. The plan of service must be consistent with any locally adopted transportation plan for the area to be served and must include but not be limited to: (a) The area to be served. (b) The procedures to be used to serve the area. (c) The estimated capital and operating costs by year for the first five years of operation, and the mechanism to be used to raise the local funds necessary to support the operation. (d) The source and amount of funds expected to be available to finance the first year's capital and operating costs. (2) Upon adoption of the plan of service, set forth in (1) above, by a majority of the governing bodies of general purpose local governments within the service area, an agreement to create an authority in conformity with the terms of this chapter may be executed within the proposed service area of the authority. The area to be served by the proposed authority must contain at least fifty thousand population. (3) Upon the execution of the agreement by the governing bodies of the municipalities and the counties which include at least ninety percent of the population of the proposed service area within their jurisdictions, and only if the agreement provides for imposition of a new source of revenue such as a new tax, the question of creating such an authority under the terms of the executed agreement must be submitted for ratification to the qualified electors within the proposed service area at a general election or at a special election called for that purpose as set forth in the agreement. If an existing source or sources of revenue are utilized to fund the authority, an election is not required. If an election is required, the agreement shall become operational upon the approval of the majority of the voters within the service area voting on the question and the authority must be created not less than sixty days after the results of the election are certified. If an election is not required, the agreement becomes operational upon the execution of the agreement by the governing bodies of the municipalities and counties which include at least ninety percent of the population of the proposed service area, and the authority must be created not less than sixty days after the agreement is executed. (4) If an election is required, the question to be placed before the electorate must state the service area of the proposed authority (municipalities and counties involved) and the proposed method of financing, including the level of tax to be initially imposed, and membership on the board. (5) Dissolution of the authority created pursuant to this chapter must be in the same manner as that for creation of the authority as set forth in this chapter. All resources of the authority including, but not limited to, real and personal property, structures, improvements, buildings, equipment, plants, rolling stock, vehicle improvements, vehicle parking, or other facilities and rights-of-way must be disposed of and the proceeds distributed among the authority's government members proportionate to their financial contribution. (6) The adopted agreement and referendum may be revised in whole or in part through repeating the process as stated in this section. (7) The Plan of Service may be updated as required to remain consistent with locally adopted transportation plans. (8) For fiscal years after creation of a regional transportation authority, the governing bodies of the municipalities and counties within the service area of the authority publicly must make available information regarding the portion of their budgets which is devoted to the financial support of the authority and the estimated portion of any revenue source which would be utilized to support the authority.

The appointees may be elected officials of these local governing bodies and if so would serve in an ex officio capacity. The governing board of the authority must be made up of not more than two times the number of authority governmental members and up to three additional members appointed by the legislative delegation as provided in this section. There must be at least five board members. The membership of the governing board must be apportioned among the member municipalities and counties proportionate to population within the authority's service area. As many as three additional members of the governing board of a transportation authority may be appointed by the legislative delegations of the member counties if approved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 58-25-30. If the authority receives a grant of the state funds from the general fund or the highway fund, the delegation shall appoint three additional members. Unless the agreement provides otherwise, the members of the governing board appointed by the delegation must be apportioned as determined by a majority of the delegation members, including the resident senator, provided, however, if there is no resident senator, then by a majority of the Senate delegation representing the county. No member government, regardless of population, may have less than one member on the board. County population must be determined after subtracting the member municipality population in that county. The terms of the representatives serving on the governing board of the authority must be staggered so that the terms of approximately one-third of the governing board expire each year. After the initial terms as set forth in the agreement to achieve staggered terms, subsequent terms must be for three years. Members of the governing board of the authority may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with their service on the authority but they may not receive salaries, per diem, or other compensation. Members shall adopt and abide by rules governing meeting attendance. (2) No county or municipality may be a member in more than one authority except that a metropolitan government may be a member of more than one authority when the services provided by the authorities are different. (3) Subsequent to the activation of the authority, contiguous counties or municipalities not participating initially may become members of the authority with the same benefits as the initial members pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 58-25-30 and with the approval by a majority vote of the board of the authority. If an election is required, it must be held only in the contiguous counties or municipalities that are seeking to become members of the authority. (4) The board of the authority shall elect one of its members as chairman, one as vice-chairman, and other officers as may be necessary, to serve for one year in that capacity or until their successors are elected and qualify. A majority of the board constitutes a quorum. A vacancy on the board does not impair the right of the authority to exercise all of its rights and perform all of its duties. Upon the effective date of his appointment, or as soon after appointment as practicable, each board member shall enter upon his duties. (5) A board member of the authority may be removed from office by the governing body which appointed him for misconduct, malfeasance, or neglect of duty in office. Any vacancy so created must be filled as provided above. (6) The authority may employ an executive director, who may serve as secretary or treasurer, to serve at the pleasure of the authority. The executive director may employ any employees as may be necessary for the proper administration of the duties and functions of the authority and may determine the qualifications of the persons. The authority shall adopt compensation plans for employees.

The declaration of intended sources of local funds does not preclude the use of other local, state, or federal sources which shall subsequently become available except for state highway construction funds which may not be used. The agreement may be amended specifically to recognize new sources. Local funds may be generated from the following source of revenue, notwithstanding other provisions of law. This source is not intended to be exclusive. A vehicle registration fee may be levied by the governing bodies of the member cities and counties on the motor vehicles registered within the service area of the authority. If this mechanism is used, the amount of the vehicle registration fee must be set forth in the agreement. The authority shall request the members of the General Assembly representing its service area to approve increases in the registration fee. Unless these members of the General Assembly by majority vote approve the increase, no increases may be imposed. This registration fee must be added to the personal property tax notice collected as a part of the personal property tax and the fee rebated to the authority. Property tax revenue must not be used to support operation of the authority unless the authority has been approved by referendum pursuant to Section 58-25-30. In areas with Regional Transportation Authorities in existence on the effective date of this act, a vehicle registration fee increase for the purpose of financing a Regional Transportation Authority must be approved in referendum by a majority of the electorate in the area to which the vehicle registration fee increase would apply.
