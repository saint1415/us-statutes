Premarking must be made with white paint, flags, or stakes.\n\n(2) Check the notification center's positive response system prior to excavating or demolishing to ensure that all operators have responded and that all facilities that may be affected by the proposed excavation or demolition have been marked.\n\n(3) Plan the excavation or demolition to avoid damage to or minimize interference with facilities in and near the construction area.\n\n(4) Excavation or demolition may begin prior to the specified waiting period if the excavator has confirmed that all operators responded with an appropriate positive response.\n\n(5) If an operator declares extraordinary circumstances, the excavator must not excavate or demolish until after the time and date that the operator provided in its response.\n\n(6) An operator's failure to respond to the positive response system does not prohibit the excavator from proceeding, provided there are no visible indications of a facility, such as a pole, marker, pedestal, or valve at the proposed excavation or demolition site.

For parallel type excavations within the tolerance zone, the existing facility shall be visually identified at intervals not to exceed fifty feet along the line of excavation to avoid damages. The excavator shall exercise due care at all times to protect the facilities when exposing these facilities;\n\n(b) maintain clearance between a facility and the cutting edge or point of any mechanized equipment, taking into account the known limit of control of such cutting edge or point, as may be reasonably necessary to avoid damage to such facility; and\n\n(c) provide support for facilities in and near the excavation or demolition area, including backfill operations, as may be reasonably required by the operator for the protection of such facilities.\n\nHISTORY: 2011 Act No. 48, Section 1, eff June 7, 2012.",
