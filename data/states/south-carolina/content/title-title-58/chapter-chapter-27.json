      "text": "(A)(1) The term \"fuel cost\" as used in this section includes the cost of fuel, cost of fuel transportation, and fuel costs related to purchased power. \"Fuel cost\" also shall include the following variable environmental costs: (a) the cost of ammonia, lime, limestone, urea, dibasic acid and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions, and (b) the cost of emission allowances, as used, including allowance for SO2, NOx, mercury, and particulates. Upon application of the utility, and after a hearing at which all interested parties may appear and present evidence, the commission may, if it determines such action to be just and reasonable, allow the variable costs of other environmental reagents, other environmental allowances or emissions-related taxes to be recovered as a component of fuel costs, but only to the extent these variable environmental costs are required to be incurred in relation to the consumption of fuel and the air emissions caused thereby. Alternatively, the commission may decide that the costs related to these other variable environmental costs may only be recovered through base rates established under Sections 58-27-860 and 58-27-870. All variable environmental costs included in fuel costs shall be recovered from each class of customers as a separate environmental component of the overall fuel factor. The specific environmental component for each class of customers shall be determined by allocating such variable environmental costs among customer classes based on the utility's South Carolina firm peak demand data from the prior year. Fuel costs must be reduced by the net proceeds of any sales of emission allowances by the utility. If capacity costs are permitted to be recovered through the fuel factor, such costs shall be allocated and recovered from customers under a separate capacity component of the overall fuel factor based on the same method that is used by the utility to allocate and recover variable environmental costs. The incremental and avoided costs of distributed energy resource programs and net metering as authorized and approved under Chapters 39 and 40, Title 58 shall be allocated and recovered from customers under a separate distributed energy component of the overall fuel factor that shall be allocated and recovered based on the same method that is used by the utility to allocate and recover variable environmental costs.\n\n(2) In order to clarify the intent of this section, \"fuel costs related to purchased power\", as used in subsection (A)(1) shall include:\n\n(a) costs of \"firm generation capacity purchases\", which are defined as purchases made to cure a capacity deficiency or to maintain adequate reserve levels; costs of firm generation capacity purchases include the total delivered costs of firm generation capacity purchased and shall exclude generation capacity reservation charges, generation capacity option charges, and any other capacity charges;\n\n(b) the total delivered cost of economy purchases of electric power including, but not limited to, transmission charges; \"economy purchases\" are defined as purchases made to displace higher cost generation, at a price which is less than the purchasing utility's avoided variable costs for the generation of an equivalent quantity of electric power; and\n\n(c) avoided costs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, also known as PURPA.\n\n(B) The commission shall direct each electrical utility which incurs fuel cost for the sale of electricity to submit to the commission and to the Office of Regulatory Staff, within such time and in such form as the commission may designate, its estimates of fuel costs for the next twelve months. The commission may hold a public hearing at any time between the twelve-month reviews to determine whether an increase or decrease in the base rate amount designed to recover fuel cost should be granted. Upon conducting public hearings in accordance with law, the commission shall direct each company to place in effect in its base rate an amount designed to recover, during the succeeding twelve months, the fuel costs determined by the commission to be appropriate for that period, adjusted for the over-recovery or under-recovery from the preceding twelve-month period. The commission shall direct the electrical utilities to send notice to the utility customers with the antecedent billing of the time and place of the public hearings to be held every twelve months, and the commission shall again direct the electrical utilities to send notice to the utility customers with the next billing if the utility is granted a rate increase by the commission.\n\n(C) The commission shall direct the electrical utilities to account monthly for the differences between the recovery of fuel costs through base rates and the actual fuel costs experienced, by booking the difference to unbilled revenues with a corresponding deferred debit or credit, the balance of which will be included in the projected fuel cost component of the base rates for the succeeding period. The commission shall direct the electrical utilities to submit to the Office of Regulatory Staff monthly reports of fuel costs and monthly reports of all scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating units with a capacity of one hundred megawatts or greater.\n\n(D) Upon request by the regulatory staff or the electrical utilities, a public hearing must be held by the commission at any time between the twelve-month reviews to determine whether an increase or decrease in the base rate amount designed to recover fuel costs should be granted. If the request is by an electrical utility for a rate increase, the commission shall direct the utility to send notice of the request and hearing to all customers with the next billing, and if the commission grants the rate request subsequent to the request and hearing, the commission shall direct the utility to send notice of the amount of the increase or decrease to all customers with the next billing.\n\n(E) The commission may offset, to the extent considered appropriate, the cost of fuel recovered through sales of power pursuant to interconnection agreements with neighboring electrical utilities against fuel costs to be recovered.\n\n(F) The commission shall disallow recovery of any fuel costs that it finds without just cause to be the result of failure of the utility to make every reasonable effort to minimize fuel costs or any decision of the utility resulting in unreasonable fuel costs, giving due regard to reliability of service, economical generation mix, generating experience of comparable facilities, and minimization of the total cost of providing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an electrical utility made every reasonable effort to minimize cost associated with the operation of its nuclear generation facility or system, as applicable, if the utility achieved a net capacity factor of ninety-two and one-half percent or higher during the period under review. The calculation of the net capacity factor shall exclude reasonable outage time associated with reasonable refueling, reasonable maintenance, reasonable repair, and reasonable equipment replacement outages; the reasonable reduced power generation experienced by nuclear units as they approach a refueling outage; the reasonable reduced power generation experienced by nuclear units associated with bringing a unit back to full power after an outage; Nuclear Regulatory Commission required testing outages unless due to the unreasonable acts of the utility; outages found by the commission not to be within the reasonable control of the utility; and acts of God. The calculation also shall exclude reasonable reduced power operations resulting from the demand for electricity being less than the full power output of the utility's nuclear generation system. If the net capacity factor is below ninety-two and one-half percent after reflecting the above specified outage time, then the utility shall have the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of its nuclear operations during the period under review.\n\n(G) The commission is authorized to promulgate, in accordance with the provisions of this section, all regulations necessary to allow the recovery by electrical utilities of all their prudently incurred fuel costs as precisely and promptly as possible, in a manner that tends to assure public confidence and minimize abrupt changes in charges to consumers.\n\nHISTORY: 1983 Act No. 138, Section 9, eff June 15, 1983; 1996 Act No. 348, Section 1, eff May 29, 1996; 2004 Act No. 175, Section 7, eff February 18, 2004; 2006 Act No. 318, Section 175, eff May 24, 2006; 2007 Act No. 16, Section 9, eff upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on May 3, 2007); 2014 Act No. 236 (S.1189), Section 1, eff June 2, 2014.",

A party to the commission proceeding may petition the commission for reconsideration of the financing order within the time prescribed in Section 58-27-2150.\n\n(2) A financing order issued by the commission to an electrical utility shall include all of the following elements and shall not issue unless each of the following elements is met:\n\n(a) except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based mechanism authorized under this section, the amount of storm recovery costs, including the level of storm recovery reserves, if any, to be financed using storm recovery bonds. The commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may be recovered through storm recovery charges and specify the period over which storm recovery costs and financing costs may be recovered;\n\n(b) a finding that the proposed issuance of recovery bonds and the imposition and collection of a storm recovery charge will provide quantifiable net benefits to customers on a present value basis as compared to the costs that would have been incurred absent the issuance of storm recovery bonds;\n\n(c) a finding that the structuring, marketing, and pricing of the storm recovery bonds will result in the lowest storm recovery charges consistent with market conditions at the time the storm recovery bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order. The financing order must provide detailed findings of fact addressing cost effectiveness and associated rate impacts upon retail customers and retail customer classes;\n\n(d) a requirement that, for so long as the storm recovery bonds are outstanding and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of storm recovery charges authorized under a financing order shall be nonbypassable and paid by all existing and future retail customers receiving transmission or distribution service, or both, from the electrical utility or its successors or assignees under commission-approved rate schedules or under special contracts, even if a customer elects to purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier following a fundamental change in regulation of electrical utilities in this State;\n\n(e) a determination of what portion, if any, of the storm recovery reserves, if any, must be held in a funded reserve and any limitations on how the reserve may be held, accessed, or used;\n\n(f) a formula-based true-up mechanism for making, at least annually, expeditious periodic adjustments in the storm recovery charges that customers are required to pay pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of storm recovery bonds, financing costs, and other required amounts and charges payable in connection with the storm recovery bonds;\n\n(g) the storm recovery property that is or shall be created in favor of an electrical utility or its successors or assignees, and that shall be used to pay or secure storm recovery bonds and all financing costs;\n\n(h) the degree of flexibility to be afforded to the electrical utility in establishing the terms and conditions of the storm recovery bonds including, but not limited to, repayment schedules, expected interest rates, and other financing costs, and subject to any conditions in the financing order, including the pre-bond issuance review process which the commission shall establish;\n\n(i) how storm recovery charges will be allocated among customer classes;\n\n(j) a requirement that, after the final terms of an issuance of storm recovery bonds have been established and before the issuance of storm recovery bonds, the electrical utility determines the resulting initial storm recovery charge in accordance with the financing order and that such initial storm recovery charge be final and effective upon the issuance of such storm recovery bonds without further commission action so long as the recovery charge is consistent with the financing order and the pre-bond issuance review process established by the commission in the financing order is complete;\n\n(k) a method of tracing funds collected as storm recovery charges, or other proceeds of storm recovery property, and the determination that such method shall be deemed the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any storm recovery property subject to a financing order under applicable law; and\n\n(l) any other conditions not otherwise inconsistent with this section that the commission determines are appropriate.\n\n(3) A financing order issued to an electrical utility may provide that creation of the electrical utility's storm recovery property is conditioned upon, and simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer of the storm recovery property to an assignee and the pledge of the storm recovery property to secure storm recovery bonds.\n\n(4) If the commission issues a financing order and the storm recovery bonds are issued, the electrical utility shall file with the commission at least annually a petition or a letter applying the formula-based mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make the applicable adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are any mathematical or clerical errors in the application of the formula-based mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of storm recovery charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges with respect to storm recovery bonds approved under the financing order. Within sixty days after receiving an electrical utility's request pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall either approve the request or inform the electrical utility of any mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the commission informs the electrical utility of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the electrical utility may correct its error and refile its request. The time frames previously described in this paragraph shall apply to a refiled request.\n\n(5) Subsequent to the transfer of storm recovery property to an assignee or the issuance of storm recovery bonds authorized thereby, whichever is earlier, a financing order is irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based mechanism authorized in this article, the commission may not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust recovery charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electrical utility retains sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer storm recovery property or to cause storm recovery bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance, unless otherwise provided in the financing order.\n\n(6) If required by the commission in a financing order, within one business day after the final terms of the storm recovery bonds are determined, the electrical utility shall provide an issuance advice letter to the commission.\n\n(a) Such issuance advice letter shall be in the form approved in a financing order and include the final terms of the storm recovery bond issuance, up-front financing costs and on-going financing costs. Such issuance advice letter shall include a certification from the electrical utility, the primary underwriter(s), and a qualified independent third-party designated by the commission, as a condition to closing, certifying whether the sale of storm recovery bonds complies with the requirements of this article and the financing order. The certifications of the electrical utility and independent third-party shall certify whether the issuance of recovery bonds and the imposition and collection of a storm recovery charge will in fact provide quantifiable net benefits to customers on a present-value basis as compared to the costs that would have been incurred absent the issuance of storm recovery bonds. The certifications of the electrical utility, primary underwriter(s), and independent third-party shall certify whether the structuring, marketing, and pricing of the storm recovery bonds will in fact result in the lowest storm recovery charges consistent with market conditions at the time the storm recovery bonds were priced and the terms set forth in the financing order. The independent third-party designated by the commission shall review the issuance advice letter and deliver its independent certification to the commission along with any other information it believes the commission should consider as to the commission's decision in subitem (b) no later than one business day after the filing of the issuance advice letter by the electric utility which will contain the aforementioned certifications.\n\n(b) Unless otherwise provided in the financing order, by no later than noon on the fourth business day after the final terms of the storm recovery bonds are determined, the commission shall either accept the issuance advice letter or deliver an order to the electrical utility to prevent the issuance of the storm recovery bonds.\n\n(D) At the request of an electrical utility, the commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or refunding storm recovery bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in this article for a financing order. Effective upon retirement of the refunded storm recovery bonds and the issuance of new storm recovery bonds, the commission shall adjust the related storm recovery charges accordingly.\n\n(E) Within thirty days after the commission issues a financing order or a decision denying a request for reconsideration or, if the request for reconsideration is granted, within thirty days after the commission issues its decision on reconsideration, an adversely affected party may petition for judicial review in the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and is limited to determining whether the financing order, or the order on reconsideration, conforms to the State Constitution and to state and federal law, and is within the authority of the commission under this article. The Supreme Court of South Carolina shall proceed to hear and determine the action as expeditiously as practicable and give the action precedence over other matters not accorded similar precedence by law.\n\n(F)(1) A financing order remains in effect and storm recovery property under the financing order continues to exist until storm recovery bonds issued pursuant to the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all commission-approved financing costs of such storm recovery bonds have been recovered in full.\n\n(2) A financing order issued to an electrical utility remains in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, merger, or sale of the electrical utility or its successors or assignees.\n\nHISTORY: 2022 Act No. 227 (S.1077), Section 1, eff June 17, 2022.",

      "text": "(A) Provisions applicable to storm recovery property:\n\n(1) All storm recovery property that is specified in a financing order constitutes an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of recovery charges depends on the electrical utility to which the financing order is issued performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of recovery charges and on future electricity consumption. The property exists (i) regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected and (ii) notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electrical utility or its successors or assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers.\n\n(2) Storm recovery property specified in a financing order exists until recovery bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of such recovery bonds have been recovered in full.\n\n(3) All or any portion of storm recovery property specified in a financing order issued to an electrical utility may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee, that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the electrical utility and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering storm recovery property or issuing storm recovery bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of storm recovery property may be pledged to secure recovery bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, grant of a security interest in or pledge of storm recovery property by an electrical utility or an affiliate of the electrical utility, to an assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, does not require the prior consent and approval of the commission.\n\n(4) If an electrical utility defaults on any required payment of charges arising from storm recovery property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the storm recovery property to the financing parties or their assignees. Any such financing order remains in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electrical utility or its successors or assignees.\n\n(5) The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in storm recovery property specified in a financing order issued to an electrical utility, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, is not subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electrical utility or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electrical utility or any other entity.\n\n(6) Any successor to an electrical utility, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electrical utility restructuring or otherwise, must perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electrical utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electrical utility, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the storm recovery property. Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit or impair any authority of the commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of electrical utilities.\n\n(7) Recovery bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the electrical utility other than the storm recovery property as specified in the financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.\n\n(B) Provisions applicable to security interests:\n\n(1) The creation, perfection, and enforcement of any security interest in storm recovery property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and other amounts payable in respect of recovery bonds, amounts payable under any ancillary agreement, and other financing costs are governed by this section and not by the provisions of the code.\n\n(2) A security interest in storm recovery property is created, valid, and binding and perfected at the later of the times that: (i) the financing order is issued, (ii) a security agreement is executed and delivered by the debtor granting such security interest, (iii) the debtor has rights in such storm recovery property or the power to transfer rights in such storm recovery property, or (iv) value is received for the storm recovery property. The description of storm recovery property in a security agreement is sufficient if the description refers to this article and the financing order creating the storm recovery property.\n\n(3) A security interest shall attach without any physical delivery of collateral or other act, and, upon the filing of a financing statement with the office of the Secretary of State, the lien of the security interest shall be valid, binding, and perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the person granting the security interest, regardless of whether the parties have notice of the lien. Also upon this filing, a transfer of an interest in the storm recovery property shall be perfected against all parties having claims of any kind, including any judicial lien or other lien creditors or any claims of the seller or creditors of the seller, and shall have priority over all competing claims other than any prior security interest, ownership interest, or assignment in the property previously perfected in accordance with this section.\n\n(4) The Secretary of State shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any security interest under this article in the same manner that the secretary maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the code. The filing of a financing statement under this article shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the code.\n\n(5) The priority of a security interest in storm recovery property is not affected by the commingling of storm recovery charges with other amounts. Any pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all storm recovery charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the qualifying utility in which storm recovery charges have been commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party.\n\n(6) No application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this article will affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of storm recovery property.\n\n(7) If a default or termination occurs under the storm recovery bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any storm recovery property as if they were secured parties with a perfected and prior lien under the code, and the commission may order amounts arising from storm recovery charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the Circuit Court of Richland County shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the recovery charges.\n\n(C) Provisions applicable to the sale, assignment, or transfer of storm recovery property:\n\n(1) Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of storm recovery property shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of, and not a pledge of or secured transaction relating to, the seller's right, title and interest in, to, and under the storm recovery property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of an interest in storm recovery property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of whether the purchaser has possession of any documents evidencing or pertaining to the interest. A transfer of an interest in storm recovery property may be created only when all of the following have occurred: (i) the financing order creating the storm recovery property has become effective; (ii) the documents evidencing the transfer of storm recovery property have been executed by the assignor and delivered to the assignee; and (iii) value is received for the storm recovery property. After such a transaction, the storm recovery property is not subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the storm recovery property perfected in accordance with subsection (B) of this section.\n\n(2) The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale and the corresponding characterization of the property interest of the purchaser shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:\n\n(a) commingling of storm recovery charges with other amounts;\n\n(b) the retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the storm recovery property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of storm recovery charges;\n\n(c) any recourse that the purchaser may have against the seller;\n\n(d) any indemnification rights, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by the seller;\n\n(e) the obligation of the seller to collect storm recovery charges on behalf of an assignee;\n\n(f) the transferor acting as the servicer of the storm recovery charges or the existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electrical utility, to the extent that any interest in storm recovery property is sold or assigned, to contract with the assignee or any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the storm recovery charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;\n\n(g) the treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;\n\n(h) the granting or providing to bondholders a preferred right to the storm recovery property or credit enhancement by the electrical utility or its affiliates with respect to such storm recovery bonds; or\n\n(i) any application of the formula-based adjustment mechanism as provided in this article.\n\n(3) Any right that an electrical utility has in the storm recovery property before its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this article or created in the financing order and assignable under this article or assignable pursuant to a financing order is property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in storm recovery property to an assignee is enforceable only upon all of the following items having been attained: (i) the issuance of a financing order, (ii) the assignor having rights in such storm recovery property or the power to transfer rights in such storm recovery property to an assignee, (iii) the execution and delivery by the assignor of transfer documents in connection with the issuance of storm recovery bonds, and (iv) the receipt of value for the storm recovery property. An enforceable transfer of an interest in storm recovery property to an assignee is perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subsection (B)(3). The transfer is perfected against third parties as of the date of filing.\n\n(4) The Secretary of State shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect any sale, assignment, or transfer of storm recovery property under this section in the same manner that the secretary maintains financing statements filed by transmitting utilities under the code. The filing of any financing statement under this article shall be governed by the provisions regarding the filing of financing statements in the code. The filing of such a financing statement is the only method of perfecting a transfer of storm recovery property.\n\n(5) The priority of a transfer perfected under this article is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order or storm recovery property or by the commingling of funds arising from storm recovery property with other funds. Any other security interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under subsection (B) of this section, is terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If storm recovery property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property must be held in trust for the assignee or financing party.\n\n(6) The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any storm recovery property is determined as follows:\n\n(a) conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority dates from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with item 3 of subsection (B) of this section;\n\n(b) a perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee;\n\n(c) a perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.\n\nHISTORY: 2022 Act No. 227 (S.1077), Section 1, eff June 17, 2022.",
