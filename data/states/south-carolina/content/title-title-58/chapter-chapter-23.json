These funds are to be administered by the Office of Regulatory Staff pursuant to this section and expended only for the purposes provided in this chapter.\n\n(F)(1) The Office of Regulatory Staff shall retain an amount of one percent of the local assessment fee collected under subsection (D)(1) to cover the expenses borne by the Office of Regulatory Staff derived from:\n\n(a) regulation of TNC's; and\n\n(b) collection, remittance, and distribution of local assessment fees pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) Within sixty days of the end of the calendar quarter, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall distribute the remaining portion of the total local assessment fees collected under subsection (D)(1), minus the amount retained pursuant to subsection (F)(1), to each municipality where a trip originated during the reporting period and, for trips that originated outside a municipality, to each county where a trip originated during the reporting period. The distribution to each municipality or county must be proportionate to the percentage of the gross trip fare that originated in each municipality or county.\n\n(G)(1) To ensure that the TNC has remitted the correct local assessment fee and has accurately reported the percentages attributable to municipalities and counties pursuant to subsection (D), upon request of the municipality, the Office of Regulatory Staff may inspect the necessary records at a TNC's place of business or a mutually agreed upon location. This inspection may not be conducted more than once a year.\n\n(2) At least forty-five days before the Office of Regulatory Staff conducts an inspection of records pursuant to item (1), the Office of Regulatory Staff shall notify the Municipal Association of South Carolina (MASC) or its successor organization of its intent to conduct an inspection and the date of the planned inspection.\n\n(3) MASC may request that a TNC that is subject to inspection under item (1) engage an independent third party auditor to verify that the local assessment to municipalities has been properly accounted for and distributed. At least thirty days before the scheduled audit, MASC must submit this request in writing to the Office of Regulatory Staff and the TNC subject to the audit.\n\n(a) The TNC that is subject to the audit shall engage the independent third party auditor, which must be selected at the sole discretion of the TNC, and bear all costs associated with the third party audit. The independent third party auditor must be:\n\n(i) a certified public accounting firm licensed in the State; and\n\n(ii) qualified to perform engagements in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).\n\n(b) The TNC shall provide MASC with a copy of the third party audit report within fifteen days of completion, which shall in no event, occur later than ninety days after receipt of MASC's written request. The audit report must disclose the amount of any underpayments or overpayments to municipalities and counties.\n\n(c) A person employed by or formerly employed by MASC who discloses to a third party any information that the TNC marked in the audit report as confidential must be assessed civil penalties as contained in Section 58-23-1680 unless the individual obtained the TNC's written consent prior to disclosure. Nothing in this section must be construed to restrict MASC from disclosing any overpayment or underpayment with the impacted municipalities or counties.\n\n(4) In the event that a TNC submits a report to the ORS that is subsequently determined to be inaccurate, thereby leading to an underpayment or overpayment of a municipality's or county's local assessment fee, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall correct the underpayment and overpayment by offsetting the amount of the underpayment or overpayment in subsequent local assessment fee distributions. In the event a TNC remits an assessment fee to the Office of Regulatory Staff that is determined to constitute an underpayment of the total assessment fee required by this article, the Transportation Network Company shall, within thirty days of receiving notification of the determination, remit the balance owed to the Office of Regulatory Staff. A TNC that submits a report containing an inaccuracy or remits an assessment fee that constitutes an underpayment that is determined by the Office of Regulatory Staff to be the result of an intentional misrepresentation must be assessed damages that are no less than three times the amount of the underpayment or resultant underpayment to the municipality or county impacted.\n\n(H) Any records maintained by a TNC pursuant to this section that are obtained by the Office of Regulatory Staff, a public body as defined by Section 30-4-20(a), or any records that incorporate information from records maintained pursuant to this section, must not be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as provided for in Chapter 4, Title 30, or any other provision of law.\n\n(I) The Office of Regulatory Staff may not disclose records or information provided by a TNC unless disclosure is required by a subpoena or court order. If a disclosure is required, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall promptly notify the TNC prior to the disclosure. Nothing in this section may be construed to restrict the Office of Regulatory Staff from disclosing any overpayment or underpayment with the impacted municipalities or counties.\n\n(J) To ensure proper distribution of the local assessment fee pursuant to subsection (D)(2), the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office shall prepare and make available for public use a GIS file showing the state's county and municipal boundaries. This file must be updated on a quarterly basis, and published on the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office's website. In addition to the requirements of Section 5-3-90, municipalities shall provide annexation information to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office within thirty days after the annexation is complete. Such information shall include a written description of the boundary, along with a map or plat which clearly defines the new territory added.\n\n(K) This section takes effect ninety days after the effective date of this article.\n\nHISTORY: 2015 Act No. 88 (H.3525), Section 1, eff September 22, 2015.",
