There may be substituted for the bond other arrangements satisfactory to the commission for the protection of the parties interested.

Nothing herein contained shall apply to any issue of securities payable within one year from the date thereof, except in case of issues made to refund such short time obligations, but such short time obligations may be renewed by similar obligations without the approval of the commission for an aggregate of not exceeding two years. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to impose or imply any guaranty or obligation as to such securities on the part of the State of South Carolina, or any agency thereof, nor shall the commission by virtue of the approval of the issuance of such securities be deemed to be required to prescribe or approve any rate for the reason that such rate may be necessary to provide funds reasonably sufficient to retire such securities or the interest thereon.\n\nHISTORY: 1975 (59) 598; 2006 Act No. 318, Section 84, eff May 24, 2006.",

The rates or fees for such use of the ROW and associated applications and attachments to authority poles are provided in Section 58-11-850.\n\n(D) Subject to the provisions of this section, a wireless provider shall have the right, as a permitted use subject only to administrative review pursuant to Section 58-11-830, to collocate small wireless facilities and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace poles in the ROW. These structures and facilities must be installed and maintained so as not to: create a safety hazard; obstruct or hinder the usual travel in or the public's safe use of the ROW; or obstruct the legal use of the ROW by utilities.\n\n(E)(1) Each new or modified pole installed in the ROW may not exceed the greater of ten feet in height above the tallest existing pole in place as of the effective date of this article located within five hundred feet of the new pole in the same ROW, or fifty feet above ground level provided; however, that for applications to place poles in residential zoning districts to deploy small wireless facilities, the authority may propose an alternate location in the ROW within one hundred fifty feet of the location set forth in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the authority's proposed alternate location unless the location is not technically feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The wireless provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in South Carolina, and it shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.\n\n(2) New small wireless facilities in the ROW may not extend more than ten feet above an existing pole in place as of the effective date of this article; or for small wireless facilities on a new pole, above the height permitted for a new pole pursuant to this section.\n\n(3) To the extent permitted by and approved under applicable zoning or other regulations, a wireless provider shall have the right to collocate a small wireless facility on and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace poles in the ROW that exceed the height limits set forth in item (1).\n\n(F)(1) Subject to an authority's ability to deny the proposal as set forth in this article, a wireless provider must be permitted to collocate on or replace decorative poles when necessary to deploy a small wireless facility.\n\n(2) An authority may require the collocation on a decorative pole or the replacement of a decorative pole to reasonably conform to the design aesthetics of the original decorative pole, provided these requirements are technically feasible.\n\n(3)(a) For applications to replace decorative poles to deploy small wireless facilities, the authority may propose an alternate location in the ROW within one hundred fifty feet of the location set forth in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the authority's proposed alternate location unless the location is not technically feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The wireless provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in South Carolina, and it shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.\n\n(b) For applications to collocate small wireless facilities on decorative poles, the authority may propose collocation on a new pole or on an existing pole or structure in the ROW within one hundred fifty feet of the location set forth in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the authority's proposed alternative unless the location is not technically feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The wireless provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in South Carolina, and it shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.\n\n(G)(1) A wireless provider shall comply with reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements that prohibit the installation of poles in the ROW in an underground district where:\n\n(a) no less than sixty days prior to the submission of the application, the authority has required all such lines to be placed underground;\n\n(b) poles the authority allows to remain are made available to wireless providers for the collocation of small wireless facilities and may be replaced by a wireless provider to accommodate the collocation of small wireless facilities in compliance with this article; and\n\n(c) a wireless provider is allowed to install a new pole when it is not able to provide wireless service by collocating on a remaining pole or support structure provided; however, that for any such application to install a new pole, the authority may propose an alternate location in the ROW within one hundred fifty feet of the location set forth in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the authority's proposed alternate location unless the location is not technically feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The wireless provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in South Carolina, and it shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.\n\n(2) For small wireless facilities installed before an authority adopts requirements that comply with subsection (G)(1), an authority adopting such requirements shall:\n\n(a) permit a wireless provider to maintain the small wireless facilities in place subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement with the pole owner; or\n\n(b) permit the wireless provider to replace the associated pole within fifty feet of the prior location, provided that the wireless provider shall allow communications service providers with attachments on the existing pole to place those attachments on the replacement pole under the same or reasonably similar fees, rates, terms, and conditions as applied to those attachments on the existing pole.\n\n(H)(1) Subject to Section 58-11-830(D), an authority may require reasonable, technically feasible, nondiscriminatory, and technologically neutral design requirements, height limitations of no less than forty feet, or concealment measures in a design district or historic district. These design requirements, height limitations, or concealment measures may not have the effect of prohibiting any provider's technology or the provision of wireless services; nor may any such measures be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size restrictions in the definition of small wireless facility.\n\n(2) For applications to place poles in a design district or a historic district to deploy small wireless facilities, the authority may propose an alternate location in the ROW within one hundred fifty feet of the location set forth in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the authority's proposed alternate location unless the location is not technically feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The wireless provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in South Carolina, and it shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.\n\n(I) The authority, in the exercise of its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW, must be reasonable, competitively neutral, nondiscriminatory with regard to all users of the ROW, and compliant with applicable law.\n\n(J) A wireless provider shall repair all damage to the ROW directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider in the ROW and shall restore the ROW to its condition before the damage occurred pursuant to the competitively neutral and reasonable requirements and specifications of the authority. If within thirty calendar days after written notice the wireless provider fails to the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the authority to restore the ROW to its condition prior to the damage in compliance with this subsection, the authority may, at the sole discretion of the authority, restore the ROW to such condition and charge the applicable party the reasonable, documented cost of the restoration, plus a penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars provided; however, that the wireless provider may request additional time to make such repairs, and the authority shall not unreasonably deny such a request. The authority may suspend the ability of the wireless provider to receive any new permits from the authority until the wireless provider has paid the amount assessed for such restoration costs, if any provided; however, that the authority shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by the Administrative Law Court.\n\n(K) A wireless provider must not be required to replace or upgrade an existing pole except for reasons of structural necessity, compliance with applicable codes, or compliance with this article. A wireless provider may, with the permission of the pole owner, replace or modify existing poles, but any such replacement or modification must be consistent with the design aesthetics of the poles being modified or replaced.\n\n(L) A wireless provider shall notify the authority in writing as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty days before its abandonment of a small wireless facility. Following receipt of such notice, the authority may direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the small wireless facility if the authority determines that such removal is in the best interest of the public safety and public welfare. If the wireless provider fails to remove the abandoned facility within ninety days after such notice, the authority may undertake to do so and recover the actual and reasonable expenses of doing so from the wireless provider, its successors or assigns, plus a penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars. The authority may suspend the ability of the wireless provider, its successors, or its assigns, as applicable, to receive any new permits from the authority until the wireless provider, its successors, or its assigns, as applicable, have paid the amount assessed for such removal costs, if any provided; however, that the authority shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by the Administrative Law Court.\n\n(M) If the authority determines that a wireless provider's activity in a ROW pursuant to this article creates an imminent risk to public safety, the authority may provide written notice to the wireless provider and demand that the wireless provider address such risk. If the wireless provider fails to reasonably address the risk within twenty-four hours of the written notice, the authority may take or cause to be taken action to reasonably address such risk and charge the wireless provider the reasonable documented cost of such actions.\n\n(N) Nothing in this article relieves any person including, but not limited to, any wireless provider, of any applicable obligation to pay business license taxes including, but not limited to, those provided for in Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58, or franchise fees. Any entity that uses the ROW, directly or indirectly, including through leased facilities, to provide services in a municipality is responsible for all applicable taxes and fees related to the services provided.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 179 (H.4262), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",

The authority shall make its final decision to approve or deny the application within sixty days of receipt of a complete application for collocation of small wireless facilities and within ninety days of receipt of a complete application for the installation, modification, or replacement of a pole and the collocation of associated small wireless facilities on the installed, modified, or replaced pole. If the authority fails to act on an application within the applicable time period, the applicant may provide the authority written notice that the time period for acting has lapsed, and the authority shall then have twenty days after receipt of such notice to render its written decision. The application shall be deemed to have been approved by passage of time and operation of law if the authority does not render its written decision within the noticed twenty days.\n\n(10) An authority may deny an applicant's proposed collocation of a small wireless facility or a proposed installation, modification, or replacement of a pole that meets the requirements in Section 58-11-820(E) only if the proposed collocation, installation, modification, or replacement:\n\n(a) interferes with the safe operation of traffic control or public safety equipment;\n\n(b) interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation or pedestrians;\n\n(c) interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement;\n\n(d) requests that ground-mounted small wireless facility equipment be located more than seven and one-half feet in radial circumference from the base of the pole, decorative pole, or support structure to which the small wireless facility antenna is to be attached, provided that the authority shall not deny the application if a greater distance from the base of the pole, decorative pole, or support structure is necessary to avoid interfering with sight lines or clear zones for transportation or pedestrians or to otherwise protect public safety;\n\n(e) fails to comply with the height limitations permitted by this article or with reasonable and nondiscriminatory horizontal spacing requirements of general application adopted by an enactment that concern the location of ground-mounted equipment and new poles. These spacing requirements may not be applied in a manner that constitutes an effective prohibition of service that is prohibited by federal law;\n\n(f) designates the location of a new pole for the purpose of collocating a small wireless facility within seven feet in any direction of an electrical conductor, unless the wireless provider obtains the written consent of the power supplier that owns or manages the electrical conductor;\n\n(g) fails to comply with applicable codes;\n\n(h) fails to comply with Section 58-11-820(F), (G)(1), or (H) or any compliant provisions adopted in accordance with Section 58-11-815(B) or (C);\n\n(i) fails to comply with laws of general applicability that address pedestrian and vehicular traffic and safety requirements; or\n\n(j) fails to comply with laws of general applicability that address the occupancy or management of the ROW and that are not otherwise inconsistent with this article.\n\n(11) The authority shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific provisions of this article on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the authority denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within thirty days of the denial without paying an additional application fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty days of resubmission and limit its review to the deficiencies cited in the denial. If the authority fails to act on a revised application within this thirty-day period, the applicant may provide the authority written notice that the time period for acting has lapsed, and the authority shall then have five days after receipt of such notice to render its written decision approving or denying the revised application. The revised application shall be deemed to have been approved by passage of time and operation of law if the authority does not render its written decision within the noticed five days.\n\n(12) An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority may submit a single consolidated application, provided that such a consolidated application shall be for a geographic area no more than two miles in diameter, for up to thirty small wireless facilities and receive a single permit for the collocation of multiple small wireless facilities provided; however, the denial of one or more small wireless facilities in a consolidated application must not delay processing of any other small wireless facilities in the same consolidated application. Solely for purposes of calculating the number of small wireless facilities in a consolidated application, a small wireless facility includes any pole on which such small wireless facility will be collocated.\n\n(13) Installation or collocation for which a permit is granted pursuant to this section must be completed within one year of the permit issuance date unless: the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period, or a delay is caused by the lack of commercial power or by the lack of communications facilities to be provided to the site by an entity that is not an affiliate, as that term is defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 153(2), of the applicant. Approval of an application authorizes the applicant to:\n\n(a) undertake the installation or collocation; and\n\n(b) subject to applicable relocation requirements and the applicant's right to terminate at any time, operate and maintain the small wireless facilities and any associated pole covered by the permit for a period of no less than ten years, which must be renewed for equivalent durations so long as the installation or collocation is in compliance with the criteria set forth in item (10).\n\n(14) An authority may not institute, either expressly or de facto, a moratorium on filing, receiving, or processing applications, or issuing permits or other approvals, if any, for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of poles to support small wireless facilities.\n\n(15) The approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility pursuant to this section neither constitutes an authorization nor affects any authorization a provider may have to provide a communication service or to install, place, maintain, or operate any other communications facility, including a wireline backhaul facility, in a ROW.\n\n(F)(1) Subject to item (2), an authority may not require a permit or any other approval or charge fees or rates for:\n\n(a) routine maintenance;\n\n(b) the replacement of small wireless facilities with small wireless facilities that are substantially similar or the same size or smaller; or\n\n(c) the installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are suspended between poles or support structures in compliance with applicable codes.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (1), an authority may require that prior to performing the activities described in item (1), an applicant must apply for and receive a permit for work that requires excavation or closure of sidewalks or vehicular lanes within the ROW for the activities described in item (1). Such a permit must be issued to the applicant on a nondiscriminatory basis upon terms and conditions that are consistent with applicable codes and that apply to the activities of any other person in the ROW that require excavation or the closing of sidewalks or vehicular lanes.\n\n(G) No wireless provider shall collocate any small wireless facility in the ROW or install, modify, or replace a pole or decorative pole for collocation of a small wireless facility in the ROW without first filing an application and obtaining a permit therefor, except as otherwise expressly provided in subsection (F). Any failure to comply with this subsection by a wireless provider shall allow the applicable authority, at the sole discretion of the authority, to restore the ROW, to the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the authority, to its condition prior to the unpermitted collocation or installation and to charge the responsible wireless provider its reasonable, documented cost of restoration, plus a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars. The authority may suspend the ability of the wireless provider to receive any new permits from the authority until the wireless provider has paid the amount assessed for such restoration costs, if any provided; however, that the authority shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by the Administrative Law Court.\n\n(H) If, in the reasonable exercise of police powers, an authority requires widening, repair, reconstruction, or relocation of a public road or highway, or relocation of poles, support structures, or small wireless facilities as a result of a public project, a wireless provider shall relocate poles and support structures that such wireless provider has installed in the ROW for the collocation of small wireless facilities pursuant to this article at no cost to the authority if such poles and support structures are found by the authority to unreasonably interfere with the widening, repair, reconstruction, or relocation project or the public project. If widening, repair, reconstruction, or relocation is required as a condition or result of a project by a person other than an authority, such person shall bear the cost of relocating such poles or support structures and any communications facilities on such poles or support structures.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 179 (H.4262), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",

A person who purchases or otherwise acquires an authority pole is subject to the requirements of this section.\n\n(C) Subject to an authority's ability to deny a permit application as set forth in this article, an authority shall allow the collocation of small wireless facilities on authority poles on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions in compliance with this article.\n\n(D) The rates to collocate on authority poles must be nondiscriminatory regardless of the services provided by the collocating wireless provider and must be as set forth in Section 58-11-850.\n\n(E)(1) The rates, fees, terms, and conditions for make-ready work to collocate on an authority pole must be nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral, commercially reasonable, and in compliance with this article.\n\n(2)(a) The authority shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation by a wireless provider, including pole replacement if necessary, within sixty days after receipt of a complete application. Alternatively, the authority may require the wireless provider to perform the make-ready work and notify the wireless provider of such within the sixty-day period. If the wireless provider or its contractor performs the make-ready work, the wireless provider shall indemnify the authority for any negligence by the wireless provider or its contractor in the performance of such make-ready work and the work shall otherwise comply with applicable law.\n\n(b) Make-ready work performed by or on behalf of an authority, including any pole replacement, must be completed within sixty days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. An authority may require replacement of the authority pole only if it demonstrates that the collocation would make the authority pole structurally unsound.\n\n(3) The person owning, managing, or controlling the authority pole must not require more make-ready work than required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees assessed by or on behalf of an authority for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must not:\n\n(a) include costs related to preexisting or prior damage or noncompliance;\n\n(b) exceed either actual costs or the amount charged to other communications service providers for similar work on similar types of authority poles; or\n\n(c) include any revenue or contingency-based consultant's fees or expenses of any kind.\n\n(4) A wireless provider collocating on an authority pole pursuant to this article is responsible for reimbursing third parties for their actual and reasonable costs of any make-ready work reasonably required by the third party to accommodate the collocation. If the authority includes such costs of a third party in the good faith estimate provided pursuant to item (2), payment of that estimate to the authority constitutes reimbursement of the third party by the wireless provider. Otherwise, the third party may bill the wireless provider for such reimbursement within six months of the completion of the third party's make-ready work.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 179 (H.4262), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",

The fee the authority charges the applicant for such review shall not be used for:\n\n(i) travel expenses incurred in the review of a collocation application by an outside consultant or other third party; or\n\n(ii) direct payment or reimbursement for an outside consultant or other third party based on a contingent fee basis or results-based arrangement.\n\n(b) The fee the municipality charges an applicant pursuant to subitem (a) may not exceed the lesser of:\n\n(i) the amount the municipality pays the outside consultant for engagements that are consistent with subitem (a); or\n\n(ii) the following amounts:\n\n(aa) for applications to collocate small wireless facilities on existing poles or structures: seventy dollars each for the first five small wireless facilities in the same application and thirty-five dollars for each additional small wireless facility in the same application during the first year immediately following the effective date of this section; sixty dollars each for the first five small wireless facilities in the same application and thirty dollars for each additional small wireless facility in the same application during the second year immediately following the effective date of this section;

and three hundred ninety-nine dollars during the fourth year immediately following the effective date of this section; and\n\n(cc) for applications to collocate small wireless facilities on modified or replacement poles: two hundred dollars during the first year immediately following the effective date of this section; one hundred eighty-five dollars during the second year immediately following the effective date of this section; one hundred fifty dollars during the third year immediately following the effective date of this section; and one hundred twenty-five dollars during the fourth year immediately following the effective date of this section.\n\n(c) In any dispute concerning the appropriateness of a fee under this subitem, the municipality has the burden of proving that the fee meets the requirements of this subitem.\n\n(E)(1) A municipality may charge a rate for the occupancy and use of the ROW to a wireless provider regardless of whether the provider is subject to a business license tax that is or may be imposed upon it pursuant to Section 58-9-2220 and a franchise, consent, or administrative fee that is or may be imposed upon it pursuant to Section 58-9-2230.\n\n(2) A municipality may charge a rate for the occupancy and use of the ROW to a communications service provider regardless of whether the provider is subject to a franchise fee that is or may be imposed upon it pursuant to Section 58-12-330.\n\n(3) An authority may charge a wireless provider for the occupancy and use of the ROW, so long as such rate is reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and does not exceed: one hundred dollars per year for each small wireless facility collocated on any existing or replacement pole, including an existing or replacement authority pole; or two hundred dollars per year for each small wireless facility collocated on a new pole, other than a replacement pole, which two hundred dollar rate shall cover the new pole and the small wireless facility collocated on it.\n\n(F)(1) An authority may charge a rate for collocation of a small wireless facility on an authority pole, but any such rate must be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and recover no more than the authority's direct costs associated with such collocation, not to exceed fifty dollars per authority pole per year.\n\n(2) Other than requiring a wireless provider to pay attachment rates as permitted by item (1), an authority may not require any person or entity with facilities installed on a pole or support structure to pay any additional attachment rates or fees as a result of the granting of an application for a permit under this article.\n\n(G) The applicant or the person that owns or operates the small wireless facility collocated in the ROW may remove its small wireless facilities at any time from the ROW upon not less than thirty days' prior written notice to the authority and may cease paying to the authority any applicable fees and rates for such use, as of the date of the actual removal of the small wireless facilities. In the event of such removal, the ROW shall be, to the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the authority, restored to its condition prior to the removal. If the applicant fails, to the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the authority, to return the ROW to its condition prior to the removal within ninety days of the removal, the authority may, at the sole discretion of the authority, restore the ROW to such condition and charge the applicant the authority's reasonable, documented cost of removal and restoration, plus a penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars. The authority may suspend the ability of the applicant to receive any new permits from the authority until the applicant has paid the amount assessed for such restoration, if any provided; however, that the authority shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by the Administrative Law Court.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 179 (H.4262), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",
