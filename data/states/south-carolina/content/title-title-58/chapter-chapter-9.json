But this section shall not be construed to require any telephone utility to secure a certificate for any extension within any municipality or district within which it had lawfully commenced operations on June 16, 1950, or for an extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business, or for an extension into territory contiguous to that already occupied by it as defined by the commission and not receiving similar service from another telephone utility; but, if any telephone utility in constructing or extending its lines, plant, or system unreasonably interferes or is about to interfere unreasonably with the service or system of any other telephone utility, the commission may make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions in harmony with Articles 1 through 13 of this chapter as are just and reasonable.\n\n(B) After notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission may grant a certificate to operate as a telephone utility, as defined in Section 58-9-10(6), to applicants proposing to furnish local telephone service in the service territory of an incumbent LEC, subject to the conditions and exemptions stated in this section and in applicable federal law. The provisions of this act shall apply to any such application for a certificate pending before the commission on the effective date of this act; provided, however, that any carrier filing an application to furnish telecommunications service as a private line or special access service provider or as a carrier's carrier prior to March 25, 1996, may elect to comply with the certification requirements in effect on that date rather than those contained within this subsection (B); provided, further, however, that such carrier shall comply with subsection (B)(4) hereof. In determining whether to grant a certificate under this subsection, the commission may require, not inconsistent with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, that the:\n\n(1) applicant show that it possesses technical, financial, and managerial resources sufficient to provide the services requested;\n\n(2) service to be provided will meet the service standards that the commission may adopt;\n\n(3) provision of the service will not adversely impact the availability of affordable local exchange service;\n\n(4) applicant, to the extent it may be required to do so by the commission, will participate in the support of universally available telephone service at affordable rates; and\n\n(5) provision of the service does not otherwise adversely impact the public interest.\n\nIn its application for certification, the applicant seeking to provide the service shall set forth with particularity the proposed geographic territory to be served, and a price list and informational tariff regarding the types of local exchange and exchange access services to be provided. Any person granted authority under this section shall maintain a current price list with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff. A commission order, denying or approving an application for certification of a new local telephone service provider, shall be entered no more than sixty days from the filing of the application, except that the commission, upon notice, may extend that period not to exceed an additional sixty days.\n\n(C) The commission shall determine the requirements applicable to all local telephone service providers necessary to implement this subsection. These requirements shall be consistent with applicable federal law and shall:\n\n(1) provide for the reasonable interconnection of facilities between all certificated local telephone service providers upon a bona fide request for interconnection, subject to the negotiation process set forth in subsection (D) of this section;\n\n(2) provide for the transfer of telephone numbers between local telephone service providers in a manner that is technically feasible;\n\n(3) provide for the reasonable unbundling of network elements upon a request from a LEC where technically feasible and priced in a manner that recovers the providing LEC's cost;\n\n(4) determine, for small LEC's, when and under what circumstances resale of local exchange telephone services is in the public interest and should be allowed. Telecommunications services that are available at retail to a specific category of subscribers only shall not be offered for resale to a different category of subscribers; and\n\n(5) provide for the continued development and encouragement of universally available basic local exchange telephone service at reasonably affordable rates.\n\nThe final commission order implementing these requirements shall be issued within six months of the effective date of this section, except that the commission, upon notice, may extend that period up to an additional ninety days.\n\n(D) A LEC shall negotiate the rates, terms, and conditions for local interconnection. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on appropriate rates, terms, and conditions for interconnection within one hundred thirty-five to one hundred sixty days of receipt of a bona fide request, either party may petition the commission for determination of the appropriate rates, terms, and conditions for interconnection. This period may be shortened or extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The commission shall determine the appropriate rates, terms, and conditions for interconnection within nine months from the filing of the petition in accordance with the terms of applicable federal law. The regulatory staff shall represent the public interest in any matter undertaken pursuant to this subsection unless the Executive Director of the Office of Regulatory Staff chooses to opt out as a participant pursuant to Section 58-4-50.\n\n(E) In continuing South Carolina's commitment to universally available basic local exchange telephone service at affordable rates and to assist with the alignment of prices and cost recovery with costs, and consistent with applicable federal policies, the commission shall establish a universal service fund (USF) for distribution to a carrier of last resort. The commission shall issue its final order adopting such guidelines as necessary for the funding and management of the USF within twelve months of the effective date of this section except that the commission, upon notice, may extend that period up to an additional ninety days. These guidelines must not be inconsistent with applicable federal law and shall address, without limitation, the following:\n\n(1) The USF must be administered by the Office of Regulatory Staff or a third party designated by the Office of Regulatory Staff under guidelines to be adopted by the commission.\n\n(2) The commission shall require all telecommunications companies providing telecommunications services within South Carolina to contribute to the USF as determined by the commission.\n\n(a) Entities that provide service pursuant to a certificate issued by the commission must remit these contributions to the Office of Regulatory Staff. All other entities must remit these contributions to the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue monthly shall assess each provider that does not have such a certificate, the provider's contribution to the USF. The Office of Regulatory Staff shall certify to the Department of Revenue the USF factor and the amounts to be assessed. The USF assessments, less the Department of Revenue actual incremental increase in the cost of administration, must be transferred to the USF administered by the Office of Regulatory Staff or third party administrator designated by the Office of Regulatory Staff.\n\n(b) USF contributions for service defined in Section 58-9-2510(17) must be collected pursuant to Section 58-9-280(E) from consumers, as defined in Section 58-9-2510(13), by persons or entities defined in Section 58-9-2510(16). The amount of the charge to be collected with respect to each retail transaction, as defined in Section 58-9-2510(15) must be a fixed per-transaction fee established annually by the Office of Regulatory Staff. Persons or entities defined in Section 58-9-2510(16) shall submit all necessary forms to the department to demonstrate that the charges have been collected and remitted. An entity that remits funds in support of the USF may file a petition with the commission seeking a review of the fixed per-transaction fee as determined by the Office of Regulatory Staff. A decision by the commission in response to the petition only may be applied prospectively and must be implemented the next time that the Office of Regulatory Staff makes its annual determination of the fixed per-transaction fee.\n\n(c) Entities that are required to contribute shall provide information sufficient to permit the requirements of this subsection to be implemented, monitored, and enforced to the Office of Regulatory Staff. All information, records, documents, and their contents provided to the Office of Regulatory Staff pursuant to this subsection must be maintained as confidential and are exempt from public disclosure under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act. All information, records, documents, and their contents that are exchanged between the Office of Regulatory Staff and other state or federal agencies related to implementing, monitoring, and enforcing the requirements of this subsection must be maintained as confidential and are exempt from public disclosure under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act. Except to the extent necessary to implement, monitor, and enforce contributions to the USF, the provisions of this section do not expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any existing jurisdiction of the commission over any telecommunications company, VoIP provider, CMRS provider, prepaid wireless provider, or any services provided by these providers.\n\n(d) A person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16) must collect the USF contribution from a consumer defined in Section 58-9-2510(13) with respect to each retail transaction defined in Section 58-9-2510(15) occurring in this State. The amount of the charge either must be separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the consumer defined in Section 58-9-2510(13) by the person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16); or otherwise disclosed to the consumer defined in Section 58-9-2510(13). At the election of the person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16), the dual party relay charge, the USF contribution charge, and the 911 charge described in Title 23, Chapter 47, may be combined into a single charge for purposes of being stated on the invoice, receipt, or other similar document or otherwise disclosed to the consumer defined in Section 58-9-2510(13). The person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16) shall notify the department as to how much of the amount remitted is for dual party relay and how much of the amount remitted is for USF.\n\n(i) For the purposes of this subsection, a retail transaction defined in Section 58-9-2510 (15) must be sourced as provided in Section 12-36-910(B)(5)(b).\n\n(ii) A person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16) is entitled to retain three percent of the gross USF contribution remitted to the department as an administrative fee. A person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16) must remit the remainder of the USF contribution to the department on or before the twentieth day of the second month succeeding each monthly collection of the USF charges. The department shall transfer the USF contributions to the USF administered by the Office of Regulatory Staff or third party designated by the Office of Regulatory Staff. The amount of the USF contribution collected by a person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16), whether or not such amount is separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document provided to the consumer defined in Section 58-9-2510(13), may not be included in the base for measuring any tax, fee, USF contribution, or other charge that is imposed by this State, any political subdivision of this State, or any intergovernmental agency. This amount may not be considered revenue of the person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510(16).\n\n(iii) The department shall establish procedures by which a person or entity defined in Section 58-9-2510 (16) may document that a sale is not a retail transaction defined in Section 58-9-2510(15), which procedures shall substantially coincide with the procedures for documenting sale for resale transactions pursuant to Section 12-36-950.\n\n(e) The USF contribution required to be remitted to the department must be administered and collected by the department in the same manner as taxes as defined in Section 12-60-30(27) are administered and collected by the department under the provisions of Title 12.\n\n(3) The commission also shall require any company providing telecommunications service to contribute to the USF if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission determines that the company is providing private local exchange services or radio-based local exchange services in this State that compete with a local telecommunications service provided in this State.\n\n(4)(a) The size of the USF must be the sum of:\n\n(i) the amount of USF support received by each carrier of last resort in 2015;\n\n(ii) the amount of Interim LEC Fund support received by each local exchange carrier in 2015;\n\n(iii) all amounts approved by the commission to provide state funding for the Lifeline program for low income subscribers; and\n\n(iv) all amounts approved by the commission for administration of the USF.\n\n(b) The size of the USF may be adjusted to reflect changes in USF support for those LECs that have made the election set out in Section 58-9-576(C).\n\n(5) For local exchange carriers that have previously reduced rates and charges to be eligible to receive USF support and that have not made the election set out in Section 58-9-576(C), money in the USF must be distributed to a local exchange carrier in the same amount distributed to the carrier from the Interim LEC fund in 2015 and to a carrier of last resort in the same amount distributed to the carrier of last resort in 2015 for so long as it continues to serve as a carrier of last resort. For any carrier that makes, or has made, an election under Section 58-9-576(C), its right to recover from the USF must be governed by the provisions of Section 58-9-576(C), and the amount it is entitled to recover must be adjusted in accordance with Section 58-9-576(C); provided, however, that nothing in this subsection restricts the ability of any carrier to withdraw from the State USF all amounts approved by the commission to provide state funding for the Lifeline program for low income subscribers.\n\n(6) For services for which a bill is rendered or a charge is applied before the effective date of this subsection, no subscriber or consumer is liable to any person or entity for a different universal service charge than the consumer or subscriber has been billed or charged, and no telecommunications company, VoIP provider, CMRS provider, or prepaid wireless provider is liable to any person or entity for billing, collecting, or remitting a different universal contribution amount than is required by this article.\n\n(7) Subject to the provisions of items (2), (3), (4), and (5) the commission may make administrative adjustments to the contribution or distribution levels based on yearly reconciliations.\n\n(8) A carrier of last resort authorized to receive funds from the USF is subject to random compliance audits and other investigations by the Office of Regulatory Staff, in accordance with Section 58-4-55.\n\n(9) Nothing in subsection (G) of this section shall preclude the commission from assessing broadband service revenues for purposes of contributions to the USF, pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(10) All carriers of last resort shall retain all records of operations within the jurisdiction of the Office of Regulatory Staff required to demonstrate that the support received was used to support the programs for which it was intended. This documentation must be maintained for at least ten years from the receipt of the funding. All such documents must be made available upon request to the Office of Regulatory Staff.\n\n(11) In order to create an environment that ensures financial stability necessary to encourage long-term investment by carriers of last resort while providing for appropriate oversight:\n\n(a) within two years after the effective date of this subitem, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall provide a report to the Public Utilities Review Committee (PURC) as to the State Universal Service Fund, the need for funding, and the appropriate level of distributions; and\n\n(b) every four years thereafter, the Office of Regulatory Staff shall provide a report to PURC as to the status of the State Universal Service Fund, provide recommendations, and provide such other information as the PURC deems appropriate.\n\n(F) Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to limit or restrict any right that any local exchange carrier may have under federal law.\n\n(G)(1) Competition exists for a particular service if, for an identifiable class or group of customers in an exchange, group of exchanges, or other clearly defined geographical area, the service, its functional equivalent, or a substitute service is available from two or more providers. The commission must not:\n\n(a) impose any requirements related to the terms, conditions, rates, or availability of broadband service; or\n\n(b) otherwise regulate broadband service; however, in order to facilitate the continued deployment of broadband service by rural telephone companies as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 153 (37), facilities utilized by rural telephone companies for the provision of broadband service must continue to be treated by the commission in the same manner as they were treated as of January 1, 2003, so as not to impact the provision or pricing of regulated telecommunications services by rural telephone companies. The commission shall not regulate a service for which competition exists if the market for that service is sufficiently competitive to protect the public interest. If the commission finds that competition exists for a particular service, but that service is not sufficiently competitive to protect the public interest, the commission must provide appropriate regulatory and pricing flexibility to all providers of the service.\n\n(2) Nothing in subsection (G)(1) of this section is intended to affect the Public Service Commission's jurisdiction with respect to any service other than broadband service or to affect the application of access rates and charges to broadband providers or with respect to broadband services. Nothing in subsection (G)(1) of this section shall be construed to relieve an incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by Section 251(h) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, of its obligations pursuant to Sections 251 and 252 of the federal act or any Federal Communications Commission regulation relating to Sections 251 and 252 of the federal act to provide new entrant LEC's with unbundled access to network elements or interconnection including, but not limited to, loops, subloops, transmission facilities, and collocation space.\n\n(3) The Office of Regulatory Staff must compile information in order to monitor the status of local telephone competition in this State. In compiling this information, the Office of Regulatory Staff must require all local exchange carriers, as defined in Section 58-9-10(12), to report to the Office of Regulatory Staff annually, the total number of access lines providing local exchange telecommunications services to an end user in this State. The Office of Regulatory Staff must also maintain a copy of all written complaints received regarding the impact broadband services may be having on the competitive local exchange market. This information must be compiled and made available prior to May fifteenth of each year.\n\n(H) Any local exchange carrier, upon a showing of changed circumstances or that it is necessary or appropriate to realign rates with the costs of various telecommunications components, may petition the commission to reexamine any rates that have been capped pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and to set new price caps. A copy of the petition must be served upon the Office of Regulatory Staff.\n\n(I) The incumbent LEC's subject to this section shall be authorized to meet the offerings of any local exchange carrier serving the same area by packaging services together, using volume discounts and term discounts, and by offering individual contracts for services, except as restricted by federal law. Individual contracts for services or contracts with other providers of telecommunications services shall not be filed with the commission, except as required by federal law, provided that telecommunications carriers shall provide access to such contracts to the commission as required.\n\n(J) Subject to the requirements of applicable federal law, a small LEC may define the term \"cost\", as used within this section and where applicable to a small LEC, to include all embedded costs as well as a reasonable contribution to universal local service, where applicable, until such time as these costs are recovered from other sources.\n\n(K) Subject to federal law, if the commission finds that the resale of any service or unbundled capability, element, feature, or function in a small LEC area is in the public interest, then the small LEC shall not be required to offer its services at a price below its cost.\n\n(L) Upon enactment of this section and the establishment of the Interim LEC Fund, as specified in subsection (M) of this section, the commission shall, subject to the requirements of federal law, require any electing incumbent LEC, other than an incumbent LEC operating under an alternative regulation plan approved by the commission before the effective date of this section, to immediately set its toll switched access rates at levels comparable to the toll switched access rate levels of the largest LEC operating within the State. To offset the adverse effect on the revenues of the incumbent LEC, the commission shall allow adjustment of other rates not to exceed statewide average rates, weighted by the number of access lines, and shall allow distributions from the Interim LEC Fund, as may be necessary to recover those revenues lost through the concurrent reduction of the intrastate switched access rates.\n\n(M) The commission shall, not later than December 31, 1996, establish an Interim LEC Fund to be administered by the Office of Regulatory Staff or a designee. The Interim LEC Fund shall initially be funded by those entities receiving an access or interconnection rate reduction from LEC's pursuant to subsection (L) in proportion to the amount of the rate reduction. To the extent that affected LEC's are entitled to payments from the USF, the Interim LEC Fund must transition into the USF as outlined in Section 58-9-280(E) when funding for the USF is finalized and adequate to support the obligations of the Interim LEC Fund.\n\n(N) The commission shall ensure that any requirements implemented under Section 58-9-280(C) are appropriate for the service territory of the small LEC and may implement such alternative requirements necessary to protect the public interest in such service area. Specifically, the commission shall ensure for small LEC's that telecommunications services that are available at retail to a specific category of subscribers only shall not be offered for resale to a different category of subscribers. Additionally, consistent with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, LEC's shall not be required to offer for resale services which they do not make available on a retail basis.\n\n(O) If any provision or section of this chapter is held invalid or held not to apply to a particular local exchange carrier, such holding shall not affect the remaining provisions of this chapter or their application to any local exchange carrier to which they might apply.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 58-378; 1952 Code Section 58-378; 1950 (46) 2466; 1996 Act No. 354, Section 2, eff May 29, 1996; 2003 Act No. 6, Sections 2, 3, eff March 12, 2003; 2005 Act No. 5, Section 2, eff July 1, 2004; 2006 Act No. 318, Section 35, eff May 24, 2006; 2016 Act No. 181 (S.277), Section 5.A, eff May 25, 2016.",

No person or entity other than the end user purchaser that filed the complaint and the qualifying LEC or qualifying IXC that provides the bundled offering or contract offering that is the subject of such complaint shall be a party to any such complaint proceeding before the commission.\n\n(C) A qualifying LEC or qualifying IXC providing bundled offerings or contract offerings is obligated to provide contributions to the Universal Service Fund (USF), and the commission shall ensure that contributions to the state USF, pursuant to Section 58-9-280(E), are maintained at appropriate levels. Nothing in this section affects the commission's jurisdiction over distributions from the USF pursuant to Section 58-9-280(E).\n\n(D) Access minutes of use must continue to be classified and reported for purposes of administering the Interim LEC Fund, pursuant to Section 58-9-280(M), in the same manner as they were classified and reported before the effective date of this subsection.\n\n(E) Nothing in this section affects any jurisdiction conferred upon the commission by 47 U.S.C.

A determination by the commission under subitem (3) of this subsection shall not constitute a determination under Section 58-9-280(E)(3) or (G)(1), or any other applicable provision of law, that a wireless provider is providing services that compete with a local telecommunications service in this State for purposes of participation in the state Universal Service Fund.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, effective July 1, 1996, any LEC may elect to have its rates, terms, and conditions for its services determined pursuant to the plan described in this subsection, in lieu of other forms of regulation including, but not limited to, rate of return or rate base monitoring or regulation, upon the filing of notice with the commission and providing a copy of any such notice to the Office of Regulatory Staff as follows:\n\n(1) If the provisions of subsection (A) have been complied with, the plan under this subsection becomes effective on the date specified by the electing LEC, but in no event sooner than thirty days after the notice is filed with the commission.\n\n(2) Except as provided in item (8), on the date a LEC notifies the commission of its intent to elect the plan described in this section, existing rates, terms, and conditions for the services provided by the electing LEC contained in the then-existing tariffs and contracts are considered just and reasonable.\n\n(3) The rates for flat-rated local exchange services for residential and single-line business customers on the date of election shall be the maximum rates that the LEC may charge for these local exchange services for a period of two years from the date the election is filed with the commission. During this period, the local exchange company may charge less than the authorized maximum rates for these services. For those small LEC's whose prices are below the statewide average local service rate, weighted by number of access lines, the commission shall waive the requirements of this paragraph until the time as the flat-rated local exchange service rate for residential customers equals the statewide average local residential service rate, weighted by the number of access lines, and the flat-rated local exchange service rate for single-line business customers equals two times the statewide average local residential service rate.\n\n(4) For those companies to which item (3) applies, after the expiration of the period set forth above, the rates for flat-rate local exchange residential and single-line business service provided by a LEC may be adjusted on an annual basis pursuant to an inflation-based index.\n\n(5) The LEC's shall set rates for all other services on a basis that does not unreasonably discriminate between similarly situated customers. All of these rates are subject to a complaint process for abuse of market position. The commission shall resolve any complaint alleging abuse of market position within one hundred eighty days of the date the complaint is filed with the commission. Rates that exceed the total service long run incremental cost of an offering or that satisfy Section 58-9-280(I) do not constitute an \"abuse of market position\". Other rates constitute an \"abuse of market position\" if they constitute any anticompetitive pricing action that prohibits a new firm from entering a market or that would cause a firm to exit a market. Additionally, during any given twelve-month period, the aggregate increases in the tariffed rates for other services must not exceed five percent of the aggregate revenues from tariffed other services during the prior twelve-month period.\n\n(6) A LEC subject to this section shall file tariffs in accordance with Section 58-3-140(F) for its local exchange services that set out the terms and conditions of the services and the rates for these services. The LEC also must provide a copy of the tariffs to the regulatory staff. The tariff shall be presumed valid and become effective seven days after filing for price decreases and fourteen days after filing for price increases and new services.\n\n(7) Any incumbent LEC operating under an alternative regulatory plan approved by the commission before the effective date of this section must adhere to the plan until the plan expires or is terminated by the commission, whichever is sooner.\n\n(8) On the date a LEC notifies the commission of its intent to elect the plan described in this section under the criteria established by the provisions of subsection (A)(3), existing rates, terms, and conditions for the services provided by the electing LEC contained in the then-existing tariffs and contracts are considered just and reasonable; however, a LEC's election to be regulated pursuant to the plan described in this section under the criteria established by the provisions of subsection (A)(3) must not be used as the basis for dismissing or not adjudicating a pending complaint relating to the LEC's rates, terms, or conditions.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the effective date of this subsection, a LEC that is operating pursuant to subsection (B) based on having complied with subsection (A)(1) or (A)(2), or a LEC that complies with subsection (A)(1) or (A)(2), may elect to have its rates, terms, and conditions for its services determined pursuant to the plan described in this subsection. If at the time of this election the LEC is operating pursuant to subsection (B) based on having complied with subsection (A)(1) or (A)(2), the election becomes effective five days after the notice of the election is filed with the commission. Otherwise, the election becomes effective in the same manner as provided for in subsection (B)(1).\n\n(1) As used in this subsection:\n\n(a) \"Single-line basic residential service\" means single-line residential flat rate basic voice grade local service within a traditional local calling area that provides access to available emergency services and directory assistance, the capability to access interconnecting carriers, relay services, access to operator services, and one annual local directory listing (white pages or equivalent).\n\n(b) \"Stand-alone basic residential line\" means single-line basic residential service that is billed on a billing account that does not also contain another service, feature, or product that is sold by the LEC or an affiliate of the LEC and that is billed on a recurring basis on the LEC's bill.\n\n(c) \"Preelection date\" means the date immediately before the effective date of the LEC's election under this subsection.\n\n(d) \"LEC's preelection state USF withdrawal\" means the amount of annual distributions or payments the LEC receives from the state USF as of the preelection date.\n\n(e) \"LEC's state USF reduction\" means an amount equal to twenty percent of the LEC's preelection state USF withdrawal.\n\n(f) \"LEC's preelection Interim LEC fund withdrawal\" means the amount of annual distributions or payments the LEC receives from the Interim LEC Fund as of the preelection date.\n\n(g) \"LEC's Interim LEC fund reduction\" means twenty percent of the LEC's preelection Interim LEC fund withdrawal.\n\n(h) \"LEC\" has the same meaning as provided for in Section 58-9-10(12).\n\n(2)(a) Beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC may increase its rates for its stand alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date on an annual basis by a percentage that does not exceed the percentage increase over the prior year in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index, as reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the customer of record for a stand alone basic residential line that was in service on the preelection date dies or moves from the residence, the provisions of this subitem will continue to apply to the stand alone basic residential line at the residence if a spouse, family member, or cotenant of that customer of record provides documentation showing that he resided at the location and requests to have the stand alone basic residential line continued in his name. With the sole exception of ensuring the LEC's compliance with the preceding sentences, the commission must not:\n\n(i) impose any requirements related to the terms, conditions, rates, or availability of any of the LEC's stand alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date; or\n\n(ii) otherwise regulate any of the LEC's stand alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (C)(2)(c), for any LEC that elected to operate under Section 58-9-576(C) prior to January 1, 2016, the commission must not:\n\n(i) impose any requirements related to the terms, conditions, rates, or availability of any of the LEC's stand alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date; or\n\n(ii) otherwise regulate any of the LEC's stand alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date.\n\n(c)(i) As used in this subsection, \"voice service\" means retail service provided through any technology or service arrangement that includes the applicable functionalities described in 47 C.F.R. Section 54.101(a). Notwithstanding anything in subsection (C)(2)(b), the following provisions apply to each customer receiving a stand alone basic residential line from any LEC described in subsection (C)(2)(b), both on the preelection date and on the effective date of this subsubitem. For a period ending four years after the effective date of this subsubitem, if the customer cannot receive voice service from any provider through any technology at the customer's residence where the customer received a stand alone basic residential line, the customer may file a request for service with the commission. Following an investigation by the commission, if the commission determines a reasonable request for service has been made and that no voice service is available to the customer, the commission may:\n\n(1) make a determination that the LEC is best able to provide voice service to the customer's residence and it may order the LEC to provide the voice service to the customer's residence. If ordered by the commission to provide voice service, the LEC shall do so directly or through an affiliate; or\n\n(2) conduct a competitive procurement process to identify a willing provider of voice service to provide voice service to the customer's residence. The willing provider of voice service selected shall provide the voice service directly or through an affiliate.\n\n(ii) The LEC or willing provider of voice service may provide the voice service through any voice technology.\n\n(iii) Other than ordering the provision of voice service pursuant to this subsection, the commission may not regulate any aspect of the voice service. The commission shall issue a final order disposing of any request filed pursuant to this subsection within ninety days of the filing of the request, and all aspects of the commission's order shall expire four years after the effective date of the order and may not be renewed.\n\n(iv) Before terminating service to a customer described in subsection (C)(2)(c) whose residence uses a stand alone basic residential line, the LEC described shall provide written notice to the customer informing him of his rights under this subsection. This written notice shall direct the customer where to file the request and include the commission's contact information. The LEC shall provide this written notice at least ninety days prior to terminating service at the customer's residence.\n\n(3) Except to the extent provided for in item (2), beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the commission must not:\n\n(a) impose any requirements related to the terms, conditions, rates, or availability of any of the LEC's retail services; or\n\n(b) otherwise regulate any of the LEC's retail services, including without limitation any stand-alone basic residential lines put into service after the preelection date.\n\n(4) Beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the commission must not:\n\n(a) impose any requirements related to the terms, conditions, rates, or availability of any retail interexchange services offered by the LEC or any of its affiliated entities; or\n\n(b) otherwise regulate any of the retail interexchange services of the LEC or any of its affiliates.\n\n(5) Beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC is not required to file schedules as required by Section 58-9-230 for any of its billing and collection services. Nothing in this subsection otherwise diminishes, and nothing in this subsection expands the commission's jurisdiction as it exists on the effective date of this subsection over wholesale services, including without limitation switched access services, carrier-to-carrier agreements, and carrier-to-carrier complaints regarding nonretail services.\n\n(6) A LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, does not affect obligations of an incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by Section 251(h) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, pursuant to Sections 251 and 252 of the federal act or any Federal Communications Commission regulation relating to Sections 251 and 252 of the federal act.\n\n(7) A LEC's election, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, does not affect the commission's jurisdiction to enforce federal requirements on the LEC's marketing activities. The commission must not adopt, impose, or enforce other requirements on the LEC's marketing activities, including without limitation any requirements of Orders No. 2001-1036 and 2002-2 the South Carolina Public Service Commission entered in Docket No. 2000-378C.\n\n(8) Nothing in this section affects the commission's certification authority pursuant to Section 58-9-280 (A) or (B), or the commission's authority under federal or state law to make appropriate determinations with respect to market entry or other matters in areas served by small LECs.\n\n(9) Nothing in this subsection affects any obligation of the LEC and its affiliates to provide contributions to the state USF and Interim LEC fund, and the commission must ensure that contributions to the state USF and Interim LEC fund, pursuant to the provisions of Section 58-9-280(E), (L), and (M), are maintained at appropriate levels.\n\n(a) For the one-year period beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC is entitled to withdraw from the Interim LEC fund an amount equal to the LEC's preelection Interim LEC fund withdrawal less the LEC's Interim LEC fund reduction. For the subsequent one-year period, the amount the LEC is entitled to withdraw from the Interim LEC fund is reduced by the LEC's Interim LEC fund reduction. Beginning at the expiration of the second year after the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC is no longer entitled to withdraw any funds from the Interim LEC fund.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in subitem (c) of this item, for the one-year period beginning on the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC is entitled to withdraw from the state USF an amount equal to the LEC's preelection state USF withdrawal less the LEC's state USF reduction. For the subsequent one-year period, the amount the LEC is entitled to withdraw from the state USF is reduced by the LEC's state USF reduction amount. At the end of the second year after the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC is no longer entitled to withdraw any funds from the state USF.\n\n(c) Before the end of the second year after the date that the LEC's election, pursuant to this subsection, becomes effective, the LEC may petition the commission to withdraw from the state USF an amount that differs from the amount determined pursuant to subitem (b) of this item. Upon the filing of this petition, the commission, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, must determine the amount of distributions or payments from the state USF the LEC is entitled to receive, based only on the LEC's stand-alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date and that remain in service as of the date of the LEC's petition. The commission also must establish a process for annually reducing the amount of distributions or payments from the state USF based on the LEC's stand-alone basic residential lines that were in service on the preelection date and that remain in service as of the adjustment date.\n\n(d) In addition to any amounts the LEC is entitled to withdraw pursuant to subitems (a), (b), and (c) of this item, the LEC also is entitled to withdraw from the state USF all amounts needed to fund any state Lifeline match that is necessary to ensure that persons enrolled in the Lifeline program receive the maximum federally funded Lifeline credit amounts available, including without limitation, federal baseline credit amounts and federal supplemental credit amounts.\n\n(10) For those LECs that have not elected to have rates, terms, and conditions for their services determined pursuant to the plan described in this subsection, the Interim LEC fund and state USF shall continue to operate in accordance with Sections 58-9-280(E), (L), and (M).\n\n(11) For those LECs that have not elected to operate under this section, nothing contained in this section or any subsection shall affect the current administration of the state USF nor does any provision thereof constitute a determination or suggestion that only stand-alone basic residential lines should be entitled to support from the state USF.\n\n(12)(a) In order to transition to the changes effectuated by items (2), (3), and (4), the rates, terms, and conditions for products and services no longer subject to regulation by the commission, which were in effect with a specific term on the preelection date, remain in effect for the duration of the specific term as to customers who subscribed to those products or services on or before the preelection date. If no term applied to the products or services as of the preelection date, then the rates, terms, and conditions governing those products or services remain in effect until a written customer service agreement becomes effective as provided for in subitem (b) of this item.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subitem(a) of this item, the LEC and the LEC's affiliates offering interexchange services must offer existing and new customers a written customer service agreement, which in the case of new customers must be delivered no later than thirty days after the initiation of service. The customer service agreement must include a provision advising the customer that he has thirty days from receipt in which to elect to:\n\n(i) terminate service with the LEC or the LEC's affiliates offering interexchange services by contacting the entity within the thirty-day time period, in which case the customer has the right to pay off the account in the same manner and under the same rates, terms, and conditions as set forth in the written customer service agreement provided to the customer, which written customer service agreement must relate back in its entirety to the date of a new customer's request for service or the date the agreement was sent to an existing customer, as applicable, and is in effect until termination through pay off. The written customer service agreement must not impose termination charges, transfer charges, or similar charges or limitations that did not apply to the customer's service on the preelection date; or\n\n(ii) use the services of the LEC or the LEC's affiliates offering interexchange services, or to otherwise continue the account with the LEC or the LEC's affiliates offering interexchange services after the thirty-day time period has elapsed, either of which constitutes the customer's assent to all the rates, terms, and conditions of the written customer service agreement. The written customer service agreement must not impose a term commitment, termination charges, transfer charges, or similar charges or limitations that did not apply to the customer's service on the preelection date. The customer service agreement is deemed received three business days after deposit in the United States mail, first-class delivery.\n\n(13) The LEC's assessments pursuant to Sections 58-3-100, 58-3-540, and 58-4-60, and the assessments of the LEC's affiliates offering interexchange services pursuant to Sections 58-3-100, 58-3-540, and 58-4-60, continue to be based upon gross income from operation in this State in the same manner as such assessments were calculated before the effective date of this subsection.\n\n(14) With respect to electing LECs, the Office of Regulatory Staff must maintain copies of all written complaints it receives regarding the following: (a) allegations regarding the inability of residential and business customers to obtain the functional equivalent of basic local exchange service; (b) allegations of anticompetitive practices; and (c) allegations regarding violations of contract terms and conditions by an electing LEC.\n\n(15) No later than five years from the effective date of this act and every five years following the submission of the first report, the Office of Regulatory Staff must submit to the General Assembly a report examining the effect of this act on residential and business consumers in areas served by the LECs that elect to operate under this subitem. These reports shall include details of any pattern or practice by the electing LEC of violating the terms and conditions of its contract with residential or commercial customers or engaging in anticompetitive activities. These reports must be based on all records in the possession of the Office of Regulatory Staff, including without limitation, information obtained by the Office of Regulatory Staff pursuant to Section 58-4-55. The reports must not disclose any proprietary or confidential information about individual providers.\n\n(16) When considered in the public interest by the Executive Director of the Office of Regulatory Staff, the Office of Regulatory Staff may file an action, in the name of the State and in any court of competent jurisdiction, against a LEC that elects to have its rates, terms, and conditions for its services determined pursuant to the plan described in Section 58-9-576(C), seeking to restrain by temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction, a pattern or practice by the electing LEC of violating the terms and conditions of its contract with residential or business customers or of engaging in anticompetitive activities.\n\nHISTORY: 1996 Act No. 354, Section 3, eff May 29, 1996; 2005 Act No. 5, Section 4, eff July 1, 2004 [subsections (B)(1) and (B)(4) to (7)] and October 1, 2004 [subsections (A) and (B)(2), (3) and (8)]; 2006 Act No. 318, Section 47, eff May 24, 2006; 2009 Act No. 7, Section 1, eff May 6, 2009; 2016 Act No. 181 (S.277), Sections 6, 9, eff May 25, 2016.",

Upon application filed with the commission and served upon the Office of Regulatory Staff, the commission shall approve such alternative regulation or price regulation, which may differ among local exchange companies, upon finding that the plan as proposed:\n\n(1) protects the affordability of basic local exchange telephone service, as such service is defined by the commission;\n\n(2) reasonably assures the continuation of basic local exchange telephone service that meets reasonable service standards that the commission may adopt;\n\n(3) will not unreasonably prejudice any class of telephone customers, including telecommunications companies;\n\n(4) is not inconsistent with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996; and\n\n(5) is otherwise consistent with the public interest.\n\nUpon approval of a price regulation plan, price regulation shall be the sole form of regulation imposed upon the electing local exchange carrier, and the commission shall regulate the electing local exchange carrier's prices rather than its earnings.

However, the commission may extend the time period for an additional sixty days, in the discretion of the commission. If the commission approves the application with modifications, the local exchange carrier, subject to such approval, may accept the modifications and implement the proposed plan as modified or may at its option:\n\n(1) withdraw its application and continue to be regulated under the form of regulation that existed immediately before the filing of the application; or\n\n(2) file another proposed plan for price regulation.\n\nHISTORY: 1996 Act No. 354, Section 3, eff May 29, 1996; 2006 Act No. 318, Section 48, eff May 24, 2006.",

Within forty-five days after the end of the month during which the charges were collected, each local exchange provider shall file with the Office of Regulatory Staff a return showing the total amount of dual party relay charges collected for the month and, at the same time, shall remit to the Office of Regulatory Staff the charges collected for that month less the administrative fee.\n\n(4) Dual party relay charges imposed under this subsection must be added to the billing by the local exchange provider to its subscriber and may be stated separately.\n\n(B) A CMRS provider must collect the dual party relay charge established in Section 58-9-2530(A) for each CMRS connection for which there is a mobile identification number containing an area code assigned to this State by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator; however, trunks or service lines used to supply service to CMRS providers must not be subject to a dual party relay charge.

At the election of the prepaid wireless seller, the dual party relay charge may be combined with the USF contribution charge described in Section 58-9-280(E)(2)(b) into a single dual party relay and USF contribution charge for purposes of being stated on the invoice, receipt or other similar document or otherwise disclosed to the prepaid wireless consumer. The prepaid wireless seller shall notify the department as to how much of the amount remitted is for dual party relay and how much of the amount remitted is for USF.\n\n(1) For the purposes of this subsection, a prepaid wireless retail transaction must be sourced as provided in Section 12-36-910(B)(5)(b).\n\n(2) The dual party relay charge is the liability of the prepaid wireless consumer and not the prepaid wireless seller or of any prepaid wireless provider. However, the prepaid wireless seller is liable for remitting all dual party relay charges that the prepaid wireless seller collects from prepaid wireless consumers as provided in this subsection to the department.\n\n(3) A prepaid wireless seller is entitled to retain three percent of the gross dual party relay charges remitted to the department as an administrative fee. A prepaid wireless seller must remit the remainder of the dual party relay charges collected to the department on or before the twentieth day of the second month succeeding each monthly collection of the dual party relay charges. The department shall transfer all charges remitted to the operating fund.\n\n(4) The department shall establish procedures by which a prepaid wireless seller may document that a sale is not a prepaid wireless retail transaction, which procedures shall substantially coincide with the procedures for documenting sale for resale transactions pursuant to Section 12-36-950.\n\n(E) If a billed subscriber purchases a service that is both a CMRS service and a VoIP service, and there is a single active mobile telephone number or successor dialing protocol associated with the service, then only the CMRS dual party relay charges that are subject to subsection (B) apply to the service. Similarly, if an exchange access facility is also a VoIP service line, then only the dual party relay charges that are subject to subsection (A) shall apply to the service.\n\n(F) For services for which a bill is rendered prior to the effective date of this subsection, no subscriber or consumer is liable to any person or entity for a different dual party relay charge than the consumer or subscriber has been billed, and no local exchange provider, CMRS provider, VoIP provider, prepaid wireless provider, or prepaid wireless seller is liable to any person or entity for billing, collecting, or remitting a different dual party relay charge than is required by this article, or both.\n\n(G) Neither the State, any political subdivision of the State, nor an intergovernmental agency may require any service provider to impose, collect, or remit a tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge for dual party relay funding purposes other than the dual party relay charges set forth in this article.\n\n(H) The dual party relay charge required to be remitted to the department must be administered and collected by the department in the same manner as taxes as defined in Section 12-60-30 (27) are administered and collected by the department under the provisions of Title 12.\n\nHISTORY: 2016 Act No. 181 (S.277), Section 3, eff May 25, 2016.",

Between the date of the written request to negotiate and the date of the commission's determination:\n\n(a) the terms and conditions of any existing agreement addressing such attachments or placements apply, subject to true-up, to put the parties in the positions in which they would have been had the commission's determination been in effect on the date of the written request to negotiate; and\n\n(b) in the absence of such existing agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise, the commission, within thirty days of the petition for a determination, must establish interim rates, terms, and conditions that will apply, subject to true-up, to put the parties in the positions in which they would have been had the commission's determination been in effect on the date of the written request to negotiate.\n\n(B)(1) Except as provided in item (2), an electric cooperative shall not withhold authorization or delay its decision to provide authorization to a communications service provider to install, maintain, own, operate, or use the communications service provider's attached facilities on electric service infrastructure owned or controlled by the electric cooperative. A communications service provider shall not delay installation, maintenance, or relocation of attachments owned or controlled by the communications service provider on infrastructure owned or controlled by an electric cooperative except as may be required by law, regulation, or agreement. All review by an electric cooperative of requests by a communications service provider to attach facilities, make-ready activities, and all pole or support structure replacement or expansions undertaken pursuant to this section shall be completed by the electric cooperative, its broadband affiliate, or by the communications service provider, as applicable, within the timeframes and other make-ready requirements set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.1411 under federal law for utilities subject to regulation by the FCC pursuant to the Federal Pole Attachments Act (47 U.S.C. Section 224) as it exists on September 15, 2020, unless the commission finds, upon petition by the electric cooperative, its affiliate, or the communications service provider that the public interest and necessity require an extension of such timelines.\n\n(2) A request to utilize poles, ducts, or conduits under this section may be denied only if there is insufficient capacity or for reasons of safety, reliability, and generally applicable engineering principles, and those limitations cannot be remedied by rearranging, expanding, or otherwise reengineering the facilities, provided the communications service provider pays the reasonable and actual cost of the pole owner caused by its attachment.\n\n(C)(1) An electric cooperative that provides any broadband facility or any broadband service that is not retail broadband service to a broadband affiliate or to any other person or entity must do so pursuant to a written contract, at market rates, and on terms and conditions that are not harmful to competition. Within fifteen business days of entering any such contract, an electric cooperative must file notice of the contract with the commission in a docket designated by the commission. If, after consultation with the electric cooperative that has filed such notice, a communications services provider believes the electric cooperative has violated the provisions of this subsection, a communications services provider may submit a complaint pursuant to the provisions of Section 33-49-150 asserting that the electric cooperative has violated the provisions of this subsection. Upon submitting such complaint, the electric cooperative must provide any relevant contracts to the communications services provider pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement. If the communications services provider and the electric cooperative cannot agree to the terms of a nondisclosure agreement within ten days after the submission of the complaint, either may petition the commission to determine the terms and conditions of such nondisclosure agreement and the commission must do so within ten days of the filing of the petition. No complaint submitted pursuant to this subsection shall be the subject of a motion to dismiss or a motion to stay or otherwise delay the proceedings for failure to set forth sufficient factual allegations to support the claim until fifteen business days after the communications service provider submitting the complaint has been provided any relevant contract. If the complaint results in a contested case before the commission, the electric cooperative subject to the complaint and the communications service provider submitting the complaint shall be permitted to conduct discovery in accordance with the commission's rules and regulations. The Office of Regulatory Staff is given authority to investigate such complaints and the commission is given authority and jurisdiction to resolve any disputed issues concerning such complaints. For the purposes of determining whether a contract is harmful to competition pursuant to this subsection:\n\n(a) the commission may consider whether the contract is exclusive, but the exclusivity of a contract does not, in and of itself, constitute harm to competition; and\n\n(b) any contract that by its own terms is available for adoption by any communications service provider is, by operation of law, at market rates and on terms and conditions that are not harmful to competition.\n\n(2) The notice requirements of item (1) do not apply to:\n\n(a) broadband services or broadband facilities that are provided for the internal electric operations' use of the electric cooperative or another electric cooperative; or\n\n(b) any agreements entered into prior to the effective date of this article.\n\n(3) No sooner than five years from the effective date of this article, on petition by any interested party, the commission may consider whether there remains a continued need for the notice filing requirements of item (1) and, if it determines that the need no longer exists, the commission may terminate the notice filing requirement of item (1).\n\n(D)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a communications service provider that has attached, or applied to attach, facilities on electric cooperative infrastructure shall abide by the terms, conditions, and schedules required of them in pole attachment agreements and will transfer its attached facilities to new or updated electric cooperative infrastructure in accordance with the terms, conditions, or schedules required therein, or, in the absence of any such terms, conditions or schedules, transfer its attached facilities to new or updated electric cooperative infrastructure within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n(2) A communications service provider that has attached, or applied to attach, facilities on electric cooperative infrastructure and the electric cooperative must cooperate with the owner of the pole and all other attaching entities in good faith to fully comply with National Electric Safety Code requirements for electric infrastructure attachments.\n\n(3) Except in compliance with the provisions of a written agreement that provide otherwise, a communications service provider must not attach to electric cooperative infrastructure without the knowledge and permission of the electric cooperative.\n\n(E) An electric cooperative shall not directly provide retail broadband service but may cause or allow a broadband affiliate to offer retail broadband service. As long as an electric cooperative maintains its exclusive right to provide electric service to customers within its exclusive service territory, both the electric cooperative that has a broadband affiliate and the broadband affiliate shall:\n\n(1) maintain or cause to be maintained an accounting system for the broadband affiliate separate from the electric cooperative's accounting system, following generally accepted accounting principles or another reasonable and customary allocation method;\n\n(2)(a) not cause or allow the electric cooperative to use its exclusive right to provide electric services within its exclusive territory to cross-subsidize the broadband affiliate or its provision of broadband service. To prevent cross-subsidization between broadband service activities and electricity service activities, any electric cooperative with a broadband affiliate that provides retail broadband service shall:\n\n(i) fully allocate all costs of electricity service activities and broadband service activities, including costs of any shared services between electricity service activities and broadband affiliate broadband service activities in accordance with:\n\n(A) the provisions of this section; and\n\n(B) the applicable uniform system of accounts and generally accepted accounting principles that are applicable to electric cooperatives under federal and state laws, rules, and regulations;\n\n(ii) not charge any costs of broadband service activities to the electricity service customers of such electric cooperative.\n\n(A) Costs of broadband service activities do not include the appropriate costs of construction, installation, attachment, operation, management services, administrative services, repair, and maintenance of the facilities or infrastructure associated with the portion of communications infrastructure and facilities or services that are used by the electric cooperative for internal information and control technology systems necessary for the provision of electricity services.\n\n(B) The electric cooperative must charge its broadband affiliate, and the broadband affiliate must cover in the prices it charges for its broadband services, amounts that fully compensate the electric cooperative for the direct, indirect, and shared costs associated with the portion of the infrastructure and facilities or services that are used by the broadband affiliate. Such costs are not limited to marginal or incremental costs but instead must include the appropriate costs of construction, installation, attachment, operation, management services, administrative services, repair, and maintenance of the facilities or infrastructure regardless of whether they are in the space apportioned for electric, communications, or any other facilities or structures;\n\n(iii) not use below-market loans or below-market funding from programs that are not intended to support the deployment of broadband facilities or broadband service in order to support broadband facilities or to provide broadband service unless the electric cooperative or its broadband affiliate imputes the difference between market rates and the below-market loans or below-market funding into the costs of its broadband facilities and broadband service. The provisions of this subitem shall not apply to loans or funding from programs that are intended to support the deployment of broadband facilities or broadband service.\n\n(b) Nothing in subsection (E)(2) prohibits an electric cooperative from:\n\n(i) loaning funds to a broadband affiliate if the interest rate on the loan is no less than the electric cooperative's lowest cost of capital;\n\n(ii) exchanging services or materials for other services or materials of equivalent value;\n\n(iii) providing reduced-cost broadband service to low-income retail customers; or\n\n(iv) conducting and funding due diligence, operational analysis, entity set-up, and associated noncapital expenditures relating to and prior to the establishment of a broadband affiliate.\n\n(F) The commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff have the authority and jurisdiction set forth in Section 33-49-150(B) to enforce compliance with this section with regard to communications services providers, electric cooperatives, and broadband affiliates that conduct any activities addressed by this section.\n\n(G) Nothing in this article:\n\n(1) subjects an electric cooperative to regulation by the FCC;\n\n(2) constitutes an exercise of, or an obligation or intention to exercise, the right of a state under 47 U.S.C. Section 224(c) to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments, as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 224(a)(4); or\n\n(3) constitutes a certification, or an obligation to certify, to the FCC under 47 U.S.C. Section 224.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 175 (H.3780), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",

      "text": "(A) If the owner of an interest in real property subject to an electric easement contends that the owner's property has been taken, destroyed, or physically damaged by the construction, installation, use, or enlargement of broadband networks within the electric easement on the owner's property that is not expressly provided for by the terms of the electric easement, the owner may file a civil action in the circuit court for the county in which the property is located to recover damages as specified by this section. All such actions must be brought within two years after the later of:\n\n(1) the effective date of this article; or\n\n(2) the date broadband networks are first constructed or installed within the electric easement on the owner's real property. Nothing in this article shall revive any right or remedy which may have become barred by lapse of time or by any law of this State prior to the effective date of this article.\n\n(B)(1) In any action under subsection (A), if the court determines that the construction, installation, use, or enlargement of a broadband network exceeds the scope of the rights granted under the provisions of this section or by the electric easement on the owner's real property, the measure of damages shall be an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the following:\n\n(a) the fair market value of the owner's real property immediately before the construction or installation of broadband networks within the electric easement on the owner's real property; and\n\n(b) the fair market value of the owner's real property immediately after the construction or installation of broadband networks within the electric easement on the owner's real property and taking into account the incidental benefits to the owner's property resulting from the potential availability of broadband services to the property.\n\n(2) Any decreases in the fair market value of the owner's property which are not attributable to the construction or installation of broadband networks within the electric easement on the owner's real property shall not be included for purposes of calculating damages in item (1).\n\n(3) The damages, if any, shall be fixed as of the date of construction or installation of broadband networks and shall not be deemed to continue, accumulate, or accrue. The judgment in any such action for the plaintiff shall include the plaintiff's costs and litigation expenses. Costs and litigation expenses authorized by this section may be claimed, taxed, and awarded under the same procedures that apply to costs in other civil actions. Payment of the judgment in any such action shall vest in the electric provider or electric cooperative all property rights necessary to construct, use, install, operate, replace, and maintain, from time to time, the broadband networks within the electric easement on the owner's real property and the electric easement shall be thereafter permanently expanded to include the right to construct, use, install, operate, replace, and maintain the broadband network and broadband services. The judgment shall have the same effect as a conveyance executed by the owner in due form under applicable law and shall run with the land. A certified copy of the judgment may be filed by the electric provider or electric cooperative, a broadband affiliate, or other broadband operator in the land records of the county in which the subject property is located, but is not required to make such broadening of the electric easement effective. The expansion for the broadband network shall include the broadband network within the maintenance, egress, and ingress provisions of the electric easement.\n\n(C) Evidence of past, current, or future revenues or profits derived or to be derived by an electric provider, electric cooperative, broadband affiliate, or unaffiliated broadband operator or broadband service provider from providing broadband services is not admissible for any purpose in an action under this section.\n\n(D) An owner bringing an action under this section may not bring an action on behalf of a class or in any other representative capacity or any form of collective action. The limitation in this subsection is a substantive limitation and allowing an owner to bring a class action or other representative action for a violation of this chapter would abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights created by this section.\n\n(E) An electric provider, electric cooperative, broadband affiliate, or unaffiliated broadband operator or broadband service provider may receive such rights from an owner of real property by service agreement or service regulation, membership agreement, license agreement, or other agreement to serve the property with advanced communications capabilities without granting an easement or right of way. The grant or agreement may permit the construction, installation, replacement, operation, use, and maintenance of the advanced communications capabilities on the property without the requirement of further consent of any other tenant, concessionaire, or occupant of that property.\n\n(F) With respect to the installation of broadband networks within an electric easement in effect prior to the effective date of this article, the electric provider or electric cooperative shall provide the same notice as is required by the express terms of the electric easement, if any, or as required by other applicable law for the construction or installation of the electric delivery network within the electric easement. With respect to the installation of broadband networks within an electric easement that is acquired other than by condemnation after the effective date of this article, the electric provider or electric cooperative shall provide such notice as is required by the express terms of the document creating the electric easement, if any; or under applicable law. Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the name and address of the owner or owners listed in the real property ad valorem tax records for the county where the real property is located. Nothing in this section shall require the notice from the electric provider or electric cooperative when the electric easement is acquired by condemnation or pursuant to an expansion of the electric easement by civil action commenced by the owner.\n\n(G) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to relieve the broadband operator, broadband service provider, electric provider, or electric cooperative from liability for bodily injury or physical damage to real or personal property located adjacent to the electric easement, subject to the limitations set forth in this article.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 175 (H.3780), Section 1, eff September 29, 2020.",
