      "text": "(A) Competition between cable television, satellite, and other providers has promoted and continues to promote additional consumer choices for cable service, video service, and similar services, and the technology used to provide these services is not constrained or limited by municipal or county boundaries. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the General Assembly to review and update the policy of this State with regard to these services. The General Assembly finds that revising the current system of regulation of these services will relieve consumers of unnecessary costs and burdens, encourage investment, and promote deployment of innovative offerings that provide competitive choices for consumers. Additionally, the General Assembly finds that it is in the best interests of consumers for cable and video franchises to be nonexclusive and for requests for competitive cable or video franchises not to be unreasonably refused. The General Assembly further finds that a streamlined policy framework providing statewide uniformity is necessary to allow these functionally equivalent services to compete fairly and to deploy new consumer services more quickly.\n\n(B) After the effective date of this act, no municipality or county may issue a cable franchise pursuant to Section 58-12-30. A municipality or county may continue to enforce existing cable franchises until they expire or are terminated pursuant to Section 58-12-325.\n\n(C) This chapter occupies the entire field of franchising or otherwise regulating cable and video service and preempts any ordinance, resolution, or similar matter adopted by a municipality or county that purports to address franchising or otherwise regulating cable or video service.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 288, Section 2, eff May 23, 2006; 2007 Act No. 8, Section 1, eff March 30, 2007.",

The notification must contain a copy of the application of the cable or video service provider including the description of the area to be served.\n\n(D) A municipality or county must respond to a request issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to subsection (C) within sixty-five days of the date of such request.

If a municipality or county does not timely respond with the number of PEG access channels the municipality or county has activated under the incumbent cable provider's franchise agreement as of the date of the application or amended application or with a statement that it has not activated any PEG access channels under the incumbent cable provider's franchise agreement as of such date, the applicant shall not be required to provide any PEG access channels to the municipality or county until the municipality or county provides a response and the Secretary of State issues an amended certificate of franchise authority containing the number of PEG access channels to be provided to the municipality or county in compliance with Section 58-12-370. If a municipality or county denies consent or does not timely indicate its unconditional consent to the state-issued certificate of franchise authority sought in the application or amended application, the Secretary of State shall deny the application or amended application with regard to that municipality or county and shall note on the notice of denial that the reason for the denial was the refusal of the applicable municipality or county to grant consent. If the applicant takes the position that the denial of the application or amended application is actionable, it may seek any appropriate relief under state or federal law in state or federal court, and if the applicant takes the position that the denial of consent by the municipality or county is actionable, it may add the municipality or county denying consent as a party to such action. If the Secretary of State denies the application or amended application under the provisions of this subsection and the affected municipality or county subsequently indicates its unconditional consent to the state-issued certificate of franchise authority sought in the application or amended application, the Secretary of State must promptly issue an amended certificate of franchise authority that includes such municipality or county.\n\n(E) Within eighty days after making the request described in subsection (C), the Secretary of State shall issue the applicant a certificate of franchise authority to operate as a cable or video service provider and the certificate shall contain the following:\n\n(1) a nonexclusive grant of authority to provide cable or video service in the areas set forth in the application;\n\n(2) a nonexclusive grant of authority to construct, maintain, and operate facilities along, across, or on public rights-of-way in the delivery of that service, subject to the laws of this State including the lawful exercise of police powers of the municipalities and counties in which the service is delivered;\n\n(3) the franchise fee rate for each municipality or county described in the application in compliance with Section 58-12-330; and\n\n(4) the number of public, educational, and governmental access channels to be provided upon request to each municipality or county described in the application, in compliance with Section 58-12-370.\n\n(F) The certificate of franchise authority issued by the Secretary of State is fully transferable to a successor in interest to the applicant to which it is initially granted, provided that the successor in interest files with the Secretary of State an affidavit that complies with the requirements of subsection (B). A notice of transfer must be filed with the Secretary of State and the affected municipalities or counties within ten days of the completion of the transfer. The Secretary of State is neither required nor authorized to act upon the notice.\n\n(G) A holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall comply with any applicable federal law or regulation addressing a-la-carte programming options.\n\n(H) The certificate of state franchise authority issued pursuant to this article may be terminated by the cable or video service provider by submitting written notice of the termination to the Secretary of State and the affected municipalities or counties.

The specified percentage, hereafter referred to as the \"state-issued certificate holder's franchise fee rate\", must not exceed the lesser of the incumbent cable service provider's franchise fee rate imposed by the municipality or county, if any, or five percent of the holder's gross revenues as defined in this article.

Within ninety days after receipt of a request by a county or municipality for business records pursuant to this subsection, a holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority must inform the requesting county or municipality of the status of the request.

All negotiations and mediation pursuant to this section must be confidential and must be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\n\n(C) A municipality, county, or holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall give the other party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. At the request of the municipality or county, the parties shall participate in mediation governed by procedures established in the South Carolina Circuit Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules that are in effect at the time for the State or for any portion of the State. Representatives of both parties, with authority to settle the dispute, must meet at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty calendar days after receipt of such notice, and thereafter as often as reasonably deemed necessary, to exchange relevant information and attempt to resolve the dispute. If the dispute has not been resolved within sixty calendar days after receipt of the notice, either the municipality or the county may initiate nonbinding mediation. The mediation must be conducted in accordance with the South Carolina Circuit Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules that are in effect at the time for the State or for any portion of the State and must take place at a mutually agreeable time and location.\n\n(D) Any suit with respect to a dispute arising out of or relating to the amount of the franchise fee allegedly due to a municipality or county under Section 58-12-330 must be filed by the municipality or county seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due, or by the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment, in a court of competent jurisdiction within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates; provided, however, that the time period may be extended by written agreement between the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority and a municipality or county.

A municipality or county may not employ, appoint, or retain any person or entity for compensation that is dependent in any manner upon the outcome of any such audit, including, without limitation, the audit findings or the recovery of fees or other payment by the municipality or county. A person or entity may not solicit or accept compensation dependent in any manner upon the outcome of any such audit, including, without limitation, the audit findings or the recovery of fees or other payment by the municipality or county.\n\n(F) A municipality or county may contract with a third party for the collection of the franchise fees and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 288, Section 4, eff May 23, 2006; 2007 Act No. 8, Section 2, eff March 30, 2007.",

If a municipality or county did not have PEG access channels as of the date of the holder's application or amended application for a state-issued certificate of franchise authority, the cable or video service provider shall furnish, upon written request by that municipality or county, up to three PEG channels, one of which may be used by the municipality or county without restrictions relating to repeat programming. No cable or video service provider shall be required to provide more than three PEG access channels on its cable system or video service network. Municipalities, counties, and cable or video service providers must cooperate in the sharing of channel capacity to provide PEG access for municipalities and counties served by the cable system or video service network.\n\n(C) Any PEG channel above the one unrestricted channel provided pursuant to this section that is not utilized by the municipality or county for at least eight hours a day may no longer be made available to the municipality or county but may be programmed at the cable or video service provider's discretion. At such time as the municipality or county can certify to the cable or video service provider a schedule for at least eight hours of daily programming, the cable or video service provider must restore the previously lost channel but is under no obligation to carry that channel on a basic or analog tier.\n\n(D) If a municipality or county has not utilized the maximum number of additional access channels as permitted by subsection (B), access to the additional channel capacity allowed in subsection (B) may be provided upon a one-hundred-twenty-day request only if the municipality or county can demonstrate that all activated PEG channels are \"substantially utilized\". PEG channels must be considered \"substantially utilized\" when eight hours are programmed on that channel each calendar day. In addition, at least forty percent of the eight hours of programming for each business day on average over each calendar quarter must be nonrepeat programming.\n\n(E) The operation of any PEG access channel provided pursuant to this section is the responsibility of the municipality, the county, or the Educational Television Commission receiving the benefit of the channel, and the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority bears only the responsibility for the transmission of the channel. The holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority must be responsible for providing the connectivity to each PEG access channel distribution point up to the first two hundred feet.\n\n(F) The municipality, the county, or the Educational Television Commission shall ensure that all transmissions of content and programming provided by or arranged by them to be transmitted over a PEG channel by a holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority are provided and submitted to the cable or video service provider in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and transmitted by the provider over its network without further alteration or change in the content or transmission signal, and which is compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the cable or video service provider to deliver its cable or video services.\n\n(G) Where technically feasible, the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority and an incumbent cable service provider must use reasonable efforts to interconnect their cable systems or video service networks, or both, on mutually acceptable and reasonable terms for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable microwave link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. Holders of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority and incumbent cable service providers shall negotiate in good faith, and incumbent cable service providers may not unreasonably withhold interconnection of PEG channels.\n\n(H) A holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority is not required to interconnect for, or otherwise to transmit, PEG content that is branded with the logo, name, or other identifying marks of another cable or video service provider, and a municipality or county may require a cable or video service provider to remove its logo, name, or other identifying marks from PEG content that is to be made available to another provider.\n\nHISTORY: 2006 Act No. 288, Section 4, eff May 23, 2006; 2007 Act No. 8, Section 2, eff March 30, 2007.",
