The provisions of this subsection apply to a deposit of litter or solid waste, as defined by Section 44-96-40(2), (6), (32), (33), (43), (46), (73), and (74), including cigarette butts and cigarette components, in an area or facility not intended for public deposit of litter or garbage. This subsection does not prohibit a private property owner from depositing litter or garbage as a property enhancement if the depositing does not violate applicable local or state health and safety regulations. In addition to a fine and for each offense pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the court also shall impose a minimum of sixteen hours of litter-gathering labor or other form of community service. (1) The court, instead of payment of the monetary fine imposed for a violation of this section, may direct the substitution of additional litter-gathering labor or other form of community service. (2) In addition to other punishment authorized by this section, in the discretion of the court in which conviction is obtained, the person may be directed by the judge to pick up and remove from any public place or any private property, with prior permission of the legal owner of the property upon which it is established by competent evidence that the person has deposited litter, all litter deposited on the place or property by any person before the date of execution of sentence. (E) A person who violates the provisions of this section in an amount exceeding fifteen pounds, but not exceeding five hundred pounds on any public or private property, any portion of the road right of way, fresh-water lake, river, canal or stream, or tidal or coastal waters of the State must be charged with illegal dumping of litter and is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than two hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days. In addition, the court shall require the violator to complete sixteen hours of litter-gathering labor or perform other community service. For a second conviction, the person must be fined not less than two hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days. In addition, the court shall require the violator to complete twenty-four hours of litter-gathering labor or other community service. For a third or subsequent conviction, the person must be fined not less than two hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days. In addition, the court shall require the violator to complete thirty-two hours of litter-gathering labor or other community service. (F)(1) A person who violates the provisions of this section in an amount exceeding five hundred pounds is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. In addition, the court may order the violator to: (a) remove or render harmless the litter that he dumped in violation of this subsection; (b) repair or restore property damaged by, or pay damages for damage arising out of, his dumping of litter in violation of this subsection; or (c) perform community service relating to the removal of litter dumped in violation of this subsection or relating to the restoration of an area polluted by litter dumped in violation of this subsection. (2) A court may enjoin a violation of this subsection. (3) A motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, container, crane, winch, or machine involved in the disposal of more than five hundred pounds of litter in violation of this subsection is declared contraband and is subject to seizure and summary forfeiture to the State. (4) If a person sustains damages in connection with a violation of this subsection that gives rise to a felony against the person or his property, a court, in a civil action for those damages, shall order the wrongdoer to pay the injured party threefold the actual damages or two hundred dollars, whichever amount is greater. In addition, the court shall order the wrongdoer to pay the injured party's court costs and attorney's fees. (5) A fine imposed pursuant to this subsection must not be suspended, in whole or in part. (G)(1) When the penalty for a violation of this section includes litter-gathering labor in addition to a fine or imprisonment, the litter-gathering portion of the penalty is mandatory and must not be suspended; however, the court, upon the request of a person convicted of violating this section, may direct that the person pay an additional monetary penalty instead of the litter-gathering portion of the penalty that must be equal to the amount of fifteen dollars an hour of litter-gathering labor. Probation must not be granted instead of the litter-gathering requirement, except for a person's physical or other incapacities. (2) Funds collected pursuant to this subsection instead of the mandatory litter-gathering labor must be remitted to the county or municipality where the littering violation took place. The money collected may be used for the litter-gathering supervision. (H) A prior violation within the meaning of this section means only a violation of this section which occurred within a period of five years including and immediately preceding the date of the last violation. (I) Magistrates and municipal courts have jurisdiction to try violations of subsections (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F). (J)(1) This section shall not apply to the discarding of deceased fish, game, or wildlife, or the parts or remains thereof, taken as a result of legal hunting or fishing pursuant to Title 50. The exception provided for by this subsection does not apply to deceased animals, animal parts, or remains thereof that are deposited or discarded onto the private lands or waters of another without the owner's permission. (2) For the purposes of subsections (E) and (F), illegal dumping is defined as disposing of more than fifteen pounds of any collection of solid waste, litter, or other materials defined in subsection (A), including discarded, deceased animals or deceased animal parts which create a hazard to the public health and welfare, but not defined as a careless, scattered littering of smaller items. (K)(1) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authority of a local government to enforce ordinances relating to the upkeep of property pursuant to Section 4-9-25 and Section 5-7-80. (2) If a conflict occurs between this section and the Solid Waste Policy and Management Act as contained in Chapter 96, Title 44, the latter controls. (L) The Department of Public Safety shall maintain statistical information regarding citations issued pursuant to this section. (M) Nothing in this section shall be construed as granting any cause of action against the State, any political subdivision, or any employee thereof acting in their official capacity to an individual performing community service under this section who is completing litter pickup without direct oversight, including any claim under Workers' Compensation. Routine follow up to ensure completion of litter pickup by a county, municipality, or state employee is not considered oversight.

(2) \"Archaeological value\" means the value of the data associated with the archaeological resource. This value may be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information that would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to realize the information potential. (3) \"Commercial value\" means the fair market value of the archaeological resource. When a violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the fair market value may be determined using the condition of the archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent its prior condition can be ascertained. (4) \"Cost of restoration and repair\" means the sum of the costs incurred for emergency restoration or repairs to an archaeological resource, plus those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be limited to, the costs of the following: (a) reconstruction of the archaeological resource; (b) stabilization of the archaeological resource; (c) ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization; (d) physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from further disturbance; (e) examination and analysis of the archaeological resource, including recording remaining archaeological information, where necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining resources that cannot be otherwise conserved; or (f) preparation of reports relating to any of the activities described in this section. (5) \"Posted lands\" means lands where the State has complied with the notice or warning requirement which must either be posted or given to an offender pursuant to Section 16-11-600. (B) The court may call upon the Office of the State Archaeologist to provide evidence to assist in determining, calculating, or computing archaeological value, commercial value, or the cost of restoration and repair of an archaeological resource. (C) It is unlawful for a person to wilfully, knowingly, or maliciously enter upon the lands of another or the posted lands of the State and disturb or excavate a prehistoric or historic site for the purpose of discovering, uncovering, moving, removing, or attempting to remove an archaeological resource. Each unlawful entry and act of disturbance or excavation of a prehistoric or historic site constitutes a separate and distinct offense. (D) For a first offense, a person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined, imprisoned, or both, pursuant to the jurisdiction of magistrates as provided in Section 22-3-550. (E) For a second offense for violating this section on the same property as the first offense or on another posted property, a person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than one thousand dollars or more than three thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (F) For a third or subsequent offense for violating this section on the same property as the first offense or on another posted property, a person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (G) For the purposes of subsections (E) and (F) of this section, a second, third, or subsequent offense on the same property as the first offense or on another posted property must include no offense that occurs more than ten years after conviction for the first offense. (H) All equipment and conveyances including, but not limited to, trailers, motor vehicles, and watergoing vessels that were used in connection with felony violations of this section are subject to forfeiture to the State in the same manner as equipment and conveyances are subject to forfeiture pursuant to Section 44-53-520, if the offender either owns the equipment or conveyance or is a resident of the equipment or conveyance owner's household. (1) All equipment and conveyances subject to confiscation and forfeiture under this section may be confiscated by any law enforcement officer as provided in this section. The confiscating officer shall deliver the confiscated property immediately to the county or municipality where the offense occurred. The county or municipality shall notify the registered owner of the confiscated property by certified mail within seventy-two hours of the confiscation. Upon notice, the registered owner has ten days to request a hearing before the court. The confiscation hearing must be held within ten days from the date of receipt of the request. The confiscated property must be returned to the registered owner if the registered owner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not know the confiscated property was used in the commission of the crime, that he did not give permission for the confiscated property to be used in the commission of the crime, and that the confiscated property had not been used for a previous violation of this section on the posted land where this offense occurred or other posted land. (2) The county or municipality in possession of the confiscated property shall provide notice by certified mail of the confiscation to all lienholders of record within ten days of the confiscation. (3) Forfeiture of property is subordinate in priority to all valid liens and encumbrances. (4) A person whose property is subject to forfeiture under this section is entitled to a jury trial if requested.
