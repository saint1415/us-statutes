      "text": "(A) Sections 9-1-1680, 9-8-190, 9-9-180, or 9-11-270 apply to the creation, assignment, recognition, or enforcement of a right to any benefit payable under a retirement system with respect to a member or retired member pursuant to a domestic relations order unless the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. A qualified domestic relations order may order that all or any part of any (1) retirement benefit, (2) withdrawal or refund of contributions, (3) disability benefit, or (4) death benefit that becomes payable under the retirement system on account of the member or retired member, instead be paid by the system to the alternate payee. No other benefits provided under the retirement system may be paid to an alternate payee. A domestic relations order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order if it orders the payment of only those types of benefits described in clauses (1) through (4) of this subsection and meets the requirements set forth in subsection (B).\n\n(B) A domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order only if the order:\n\n(1) clearly specifies the retirement system to which it applies;\n\n(2) clearly specifies the name, social security number, and last known mailing address of the member or retired member and the name, social security number, and mailing address of the alternate payee covered by the order, and states the date of marriage;\n\n(3) clearly specifies the types of benefits described in subsection (A) to which the order applies;\n\n(4) clearly specifies the amount or percentage of each benefit to be paid by the retirement system to the alternate payee or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined;\n\n(5) clearly specifies the number of payments or the period to which the order applies;\n\n(6) clearly specifies whether the alternate payee is to share proportionately in benefit increases due to cost-of-living adjustments;\n\n(7) does not require the retirement system to pay any benefit at a time or in an amount that would not otherwise have been payable at the time or in such an amount;\n\n(8) does not require the retirement system to provide any benefit or option not otherwise provided under the provisions of law governing the system;\n\n(9) does not require the retirement system to provide the alternate payee optional payment forms;\n\n(10) does not require the retirement system to provide increased benefits determined on the basis of actuarial value;\n\n(11) does not require the payment of benefits to the alternate payee which is required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order;\n\n(12) does not require the payment of benefits to the alternate payee before the retirement of a member, the distribution of a withdrawal of contributions to a member, or other distribution to a member, retired member, or beneficiary;\n\n(13) does not require that the alternate payee be provided the right to designate a beneficiary to receive benefits after the alternate payee's death;\n\n(14) does not require that a member, retired member, or beneficiary elect a particular optional payment form or make any other election, except for the designation of the alternate payee as a recipient of death benefits; and\n\n(15) does not require a member to terminate employment, to withdraw contributions, or to apply for retirement.\n\n(C) The retirement system may reject a domestic relations order as a qualified domestic relations order if the order:\n\n(1) does not provide for a proportional reduction of the amount awarded to the alternate payee if payment of benefits commences before the member attains normal retirement age;\n\n(2) does not provide clearly for each possible benefit distribution permitted under the provisions of the retirement system;\n\n(3) requires any action on the part of the retirement system that is contrary to any provision of law;\n\n(4) makes the award of an interest contingent on any condition other than those conditions resulting in the liability of the retirement system for payments under its provisions;\n\n(5) awards any future benefit increases that are provided or required by law, other than ordinary cost-of-living adjustments; or\n\n(6) does not provide for a proportional reduction of the amount awarded to the alternate payee if benefits available to the member or retired member are reduced by law.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 38, Section 1, eff July 1, 1995 (became law without the Governor's signature on April 27, 1995).",

      "text": "(A) The administrator of the retirement system or his designee has exclusive authority to determine whether or not a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order. For purposes of this chapter only, the administrator of the retirement system or his designee is considered a single hearing officer within the meaning of Section 1-23-600(B) and, as such, appeals from their determination are to the Administrative Law Court under its applicable procedures.\n\n(B) The administrator of the retirement system or his designee upon receipt of a certified copy of a domestic relations order, shall determine whether the order is a qualified domestic relations order and shall notify the member or retired member and the alternate payee of the determination. If the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the retirement system shall pay benefits in accordance with the order. If the order is determined not to be a qualified domestic relations order, the member or retired member or alternate payee named in the order may appeal the administrator's determination in the manner specified in subsection (A) of this section and may petition the court which issued the order to amend the order so that it will be qualified. The court which issued the order or which would otherwise have jurisdiction over the matter has jurisdiction to amend the order so that it will be qualified even though all other matters incident to the action or proceeding have been fully and finally adjudicated.\n\n(C) During any period in which the issue of whether or not a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined by the administrator, his designee, a court of competent jurisdiction, or the retirement system, the retirement system shall separately account for the amounts which would have been payable to the alternate payee during the period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. These separately accounted amounts are \"segregated amounts\" for purposes of this section.\n\n(D) If a domestic relations order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, then the retirement system shall pay the segregated amounts without interest to the person or persons entitled thereto and shall thereafter pay benefits pursuant to the order.\n\n(E) If a domestic relations order is determined not to be a qualified domestic relations order or if within eighteen months of the date a domestic relations order is received by the retirement system the issue as to whether the order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved, then the retirement system shall pay the segregated amounts without interest to the person or persons who would have been entitled to the amounts if there had been no order. This subsection must not be construed to limit or otherwise affect any liability, responsibility, or duty of a party with respect to any other party to the action out of which the order arose.\n\n(F) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the eighteen-month period must be applied prospectively only.\n\n(G) The retirement systems, the board, and officers and employees of each retirement system are not liable to any person for making payments of any benefits in accordance with a qualified domestic relations order in a cause in which a member or a retired member was a party or for making payments in accordance with subsections (D) and (E) of this section.\n\n(H) A court does not have jurisdiction over a retirement system with respect to a divorce or other domestic relations action in which an alternate payee's right to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable to a member or retired member under the retirement system is created or established. A party to such an action who attempts to make the retirement system a party to the action contrary to the provision of this subsection is liable to the retirement system for its costs and attorney's fees.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 38, Section 1, eff July 1, 1995 (became law without the Governor's signature on April 27, 1995).",
