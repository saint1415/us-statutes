The application must set forth the requested date of admission, which must be the January first, or the April first, or the July first, or the October first next following receipt by the board of the application, except that in the case of any applications received before January 1, 1963, the requested date of admission may be July 1, 1962.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such application is received prior to July 1, 1966, the requested date of the admission shall be July 1, 1962; provided that contributions are made to the System within the calendar year 1966, in such manner as the Board deems reasonable, by the political subdivision seeking such admission and each and every police officer in its employ who will become a member following such admission, in amounts respectively equal to the total contributions which they would have made had such political subdivision become an employer as of July 1, 1962.\n\n(c) When such application is received after June 30, 1966 and prior to April 1, 1974, the requested date of such admission may be July 1, 1962, without loss or prejudice to their affected employees' claims to prior service credits but such electing employers and their employees shall be subject to the payment of such contributions, if any, as the Board may determine to be necessary to avoid any possible discrimination as against employers and employees coming under the terms hereof at an earlier date.\n\n(d) An employer whose requested date of admission is on or after July 1, 1974, shall agree to make contributions on account of all service before the date of admission rendered by members in its employ who make contributions with respect to such service.\n\n(2) In no event will admission as an employer be allowed unless a majority of all persons then employed as police officers by the prospective employer elect irrevocably to become members of the System as of the requested date of admission.\n\n(3) Any employer participating in the System as of June 30, 1974 which is not participating in the Supplemental Allowance Program may elect as of July 1, 1974 or as of July 1 of any year thereafter to provide Class Two membership for police officers in its employ and thereby enable them to qualify for benefits based on Class Two service. Any such employer who so elects shall agree to pay the increased rate of employer contributions applicable to Class Two members with respect to police officers in its employ who become Class Two members. The police officers in the employ of any such employer which does not make such election shall be entitled only to the benefits herein provided with respect to Class One service.\n\n(4) All persons who become employed as police officers by the State or other employer after the employer's date of admission to the system under the provisions of this section must become members, as a condition of their employment.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no person shall become a member on or after July 1, 1963 unless his employer certifies to the system that his service as a police officer requires at least one thousand six hundred hours a year of active duty and that the person's salary for the service is at least two thousand dollars a year. If in any year after this certification the member does not render at least one thousand six hundred hours of active duty as a police officer, or if the member does not receive at least two thousand dollars in salary, his membership ceases and the provisions of Section 9-11-100 apply.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be eligible to participate in the System as a member and in another fund with respect to the same position nor shall any person be entitled to receive duplicate benefits for the same period of service in the same position.\n\n(6) All persons who are employed as police officers by an employer at the date of the employer's admission to the System shall become members as of such date unless, within a period of one month following such date, they shall have filed with the Board on a form prescribed by the Board a notice of their election not to be covered in the membership and duly executed waiver of all present and prospective benefits which would otherwise inure to them on account of their participation in the System.\n\n(7) Each member shall be classified as either a Class One member or a Class Two member, as hereinafter provided, and shall make the contributions and be eligible for the benefits provided for his class.

Service credited to the member under the provisions of the first System must be considered service credits for the purpose of determining eligibility for benefits, but not the amount thereof, under the other System. Any benefit under any one of the correlated systems must be computed solely on the basis of service and contributions credited under that System, and must be payable at such times and subject to such age and service conditions as are set forth therein, except the average final salary under either the South Carolina Retirement System or the Police Officers Retirement System may be used for the benefit calculation under both systems for consecutive earned service credit. A member is not eligible to receive retirement payments so long as he is employed in a position covered by the South Carolina Retirement System or the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System.\n\nA member of the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System may transfer credited service he received under the South Carolina Retirement System to the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System on payment of accumulated employer and employee contributions and interest in the South Carolina Retirement System plus five percent of current compensation for each year of service prorated for periods of less than a year.\n\nService transferred under this subsection that was earned in the South Carolina Retirement System is \"earned service\" and counts toward the required five or more years of earned service necessary for benefit eligibility. With respect to service transferred to the system under this subsection, compensation earned while participating in the South Carolina Retirement System is not earnable compensation under the system and shall not be used in calculating a member's average final compensation.\n\n(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State, and any agency or department thereof which is participating in the South Carolina Retirement System with respect to firemen in its employ, may become an employer under the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System with respect to such firemen by applying to the Board for admission to the System and complying with the rules and regulations of the Board. Such application shall set forth the requested date of admission which shall be July 1, 1976, or any subsequent July first, next following receipt by the Board of such application.\n\nIn no event will admission as an employer under this subsection be allowed unless a majority of all persons then employed as firemen by the prospective employer elect irrevocably to become members of the System as of the requested date of admission.\n\nAll persons who are employed as firemen by such employer at the date of the employer's admission to the System shall become members as of such date unless, within a period of one month following such date, they shall have filed with the Board on a form prescribed by the Board a notice of their election not to be covered in the membership and a duly executed waiver of all present and prospective benefits which would otherwise inure to them on account of their participation in the System.\n\nAll persons who become employed as firemen by the State or other employer after the employer's date of admission to the System under the provisions of this subsection shall become members, as a condition of their employment.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no fireman shall become a member on or after July 1, 1976, unless the member's employer certifies to the system that his service as a fireman requires at least one thousand, six hundred hours a year of active duty and that the member's salary for the service is at least two thousand dollars a year. If in any year after this certification the member does not render at least one thousand, six hundred hours of active duty as a fireman, or if the member does not receive at least two thousand dollars in salary, his membership ceases and the provisions of Section 9-11-100 apply.\n\nEach fireman who becomes a member of the System as provided in this subsection shall be classified as a Class Two member and shall make the contributions and be eligible for the benefits provided for Class Two members. With respect to his service while a member of the System, any fireman who becomes a member of the System pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to all of the provisions of this article which would be applicable if he were a police officer.\n\nIf a fireman is a member of the South Carolina Retirement System at the time he becomes a member of the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System his membership in the South Carolina Retirement System shall be continued so long as his membership in the South Carolina Police Officers System continues. Service credited to the member under the provisions of the South Carolina Retirement System shall be considered credited service for the purpose of determining eligibility for benefits, but not the amount thereof, under the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System. Any benefit under either one of these two correlated systems shall be computed solely on the basis of service and contributions credited under that System, but in determining the member's average final compensation, his compensation received during credited service under both Systems shall be taken into account. Such benefits shall be payable at such times and subject to such age and service conditions as provided under the respective Systems; provided, however, a member shall not be eligible to receive retirement payments so long as he is employed in a position covered by the South Carolina Retirement System or the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System. Notwithstanding the above, the disability retirement benefit shall only be paid from and based on the benefit provisions of the System to which the member is contributing at the time of disability and shall be based on the total of his credited service under both Systems. The amount of accumulated contributions of such disabled member which is credited to his account under the System to which he is not contributing at the time of disability, shall be transferred to the System from which his disability retirement benefit shall be paid.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 61-334; 1962 (52) 1933; 1963 (53) 70; 1966 (54) 2424; 1967 (55) 252; 1970 (56) 1947; 1974 (58) 2032; 1976 Act No. 586 Section 2; 1980 Act No. 448, Section 3; 1986 Act No. 529, Section 5, eff June 18, 1986; 1988 Act No. 658, Part II, Section 47, eff June 8, 1988; 1989 Act No. 123, Section 1, eff May 30, 1989; 2000 Act No. 387, Part II, Sections 67H, 67I, 67J, eff January 1, 2001; 2003 Act No. 77, Section 4, eff June 27, 2003.",

For purposes of this section, a member is considered to be in service on the date the application is filed if the member is not retired and the last day the member was employed by a covered employer in the system occurred not more than one year before the date of filing.\n\nThe South Carolina Retirement System may contract with the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation to evaluate the medical evidence submitted with the disability application relative to the job being performed and make recommendations to the system. The system may approve a disability retirement subject to the member participating in vocational rehabilitation with the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. Upon determination by the department that a member retired on disability is able to reenter the job market and work is available, the retirement system may adjust the benefit paid by the system in accordance with Sections 9-1-1580, 9-1-1590, 9-9-60, and 9-11-90.\n\n(2)(A) Upon disability retirement based upon an application received by the system before January 1, 2014, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance which shall be equal to a service retirement allowance computed on the basis of his average final compensation, his years of credited service and his accumulated additional contributions at the date of his disability retirement; provided, however, that, at disability retirement, his disability retirement allowance shall be determined on the basis of the number of years of credited service the member would have completed had he remained in service until attaining age fifty-five and on the basis of the average final compensation. For the purpose of calculating the disability retirement allowance, the additional credited service so determined must be either Class One service, Class Two service, or Class Three service depending upon the classification of the member at the time of retirement.\n\n(B) Upon disability retirement based upon an application received by the system after December 31, 2013, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance which is equal to a service retirement allowance computed on the basis of the member's average final compensation, the member's years of credited service, and the member's accumulated additional contributions at the date of the member's disability retirement. However, at disability retirement, the member's disability retirement allowance must be determined on the basis of the member's average final compensation at retirement and on the basis of the number of years of credited service the member would have completed had the member remained in service until attaining age fifty-five or until attaining twenty-five years of credited service, whichever is less. For the purpose of calculating the disability retirement allowance, the additional credited service so determined must be either Class One service, Class Two service, or Class Three service depending upon the classification of the member at the time of retirement.\n\n(3) Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every three-year period thereafter, the board may require any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained the age of fifty-five years to undergo a medical examination, such examination to be made at the place of residence of the beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon, by the system. If a disability beneficiary who has not yet attained the age of fifty-five years refuses to submit to any such medical examination, the member's retirement allowance may be discontinued until the member's withdrawal of such refusal, and if the refusal continues for one year, all the member's rights in and to the member's retirement allowance may be revoked, but upon revocation any unexpended portion of the member's accumulated contributions to date of retirement shall be returned to the member.\n\n(4) If the system certifies that the member's disability has been removed and that the member has regained earning capacity, the member's disability retirement allowance may be discontinued, or if the disability has been partly removed and the member's earning capacity regained in part, the disability retirement allowance may be reduced proportionately as provided pursuant to Section 9-1-1580. The determination of the board as to any disputed question, after due consideration accorded to the member, is conclusive. If the retirement allowance of any member retired for disability is discontinued or reduced, and if the member again suffers disability within five years of the date of the member's recovery and again loses earning capacity, the member is entitled to apply to the board for a restoration of the original retirement allowance, and the board may restore all or part of the member's original retirement allowance. At the expiration of the five-year period, if the retirement allowance has not been restored, all rights in and to the member's disability retirement allowance are revoked. The member then is entitled to a deferred early retirement allowance as provided in Section 9-11-70 based upon the member's average final compensation and credited service at the member's date of disability retirement.\n\n(5) After age fifty-five, a disability retiree is subject to the same earnings limitation as a service retiree.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon retirement for disability after October 15, 1992, at any age, a member must receive a disability retirement allowance equal to at least fifteen percent of his average final compensation.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 61-338; 1962 (52) 1933; 1971 (57) 66; 1974 (58) 2032; 1979 Act No. 102 Section 2; 1979 Act No. 140 Section 1; 1980 Act No. 408; 1981 Act No. 32 Section 4; 1982 Act No. 466 Part II Section 23B; 1984 Act No. 383, Section 3; 1985 Act No. 74 Section 3; 1986 Act No. 529, Section 7, eff June 18, 1986; 1993 Act No. 166, Section 2, eff June 16, 1993; 2000 Act No. 387, Part II, Section 67N, eff January 1, 2001; 2010 Act No. 162, Section 3, eff May 12, 2010; 2012 Act No. 278, Pt III, Section 24, eff July 1, 2012; 2013 Act No. 69, Section 1, eff June 13, 2013; 2018 Act No. 221 (H.4698), Section 2.C, eff May 18, 2018.",

Upon the completion of the payment, this period must also be credited to him as membership service.

If the retired member continues in service after having earned ten thousand dollars in a calendar year, the member's retirement allowance must be discontinued during the member's period of service in the remainder of the calendar year. If the employment continues for at least forty-eight consecutive months, the provisions of Section 9-11-90(3) apply. If a retired member of the system returns to employment covered by the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System or any other system provided in this title sooner than thirty consecutive calendar days after retirement, the member's retirement allowance is suspended while the member remains employed by a participating employer of any of these systems. If an employer fails to notify the system of the engagement of a retired member to perform services, the employer shall reimburse the system for all benefits wrongly paid to the retired member.\n\n(ii) The earnings limitation imposed pursuant to this item does not apply if the member meets at least one of the following qualifications:\n\n(A) the member retired before January 2, 2013;\n\n(B) the member has attained the age of fifty-seven years at retirement; or\n\n(C) compensation received by the retired member from the covered employer is for service in a public office filled by the appointment of the Governor and with confirmation by the Senate, by appointment or election by the General Assembly, or by election of the qualified electors of the applicable jurisdiction.\n\n(b) An employer shall pay to the system the employer contribution for active members prescribed by law with respect to any retired member engaged to perform services for the employer, regardless of whether the retired member is a full-time or part-time employee or a temporary or permanent employee.

The retired member does not accrue additional service credit in the system by reason of the contributions required pursuant to this item and item (b) of this subsection.\n\n(d) A retired member of the Police Officers Retirement System who is not a member of the South Carolina Retirement System, but is employed in a position that would otherwise be covered by the South Carolina Retirement System, shall not join the South Carolina Retirement System but, notwithstanding any other provision of law, that member is deemed a retired contributing member of the Police Officers Retirement System and shall remit the employee contributions required under item (c) of this subsection to the Police Officers Retirement System and the employer shall remit to the Police Officers Retirement System the employer contribution required by item (b).

If a member does not elect to make the payment, his benefit must be automatically adjusted when no such excess exists, but not before July 1, 1992.\n\n(E) Except as provided in this section, a retired member may not change the form of his monthly payment after the first payment of a retirement allowance is due.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 61-342; 1962 (52) 1933; 1974 (58) 2032; 1977 Act No. 29 Section 2; 1982 Act No. 369, Section 3; 1984 Act No. 381, Section 3; 1985 Act No. 201, Part II, Section 65B; 1986 Act No. 540, Part II, Section 23C, effective June 18, 1986, and became law without the Governor's signature; 1990 Act No. 412, Section 3, eff January 1, 1991, except Option 3 which became eff July 1, 1990; 1992 Act No. 336, Sections 5, 7, eff May 4, 1992; 1996 Act No. 458, Part II, Section 47C, eff June 19, 1996; 2000 Act No. 387, Part II, Section 67T, eff January 1, 2001; 2008 Act No. 311, Sections 19 and 40, eff June 4, 2008; 2015 Act No. 27 (S.373), Section 2, eff June 1, 2015.",

Notwithstanding any contrary provision or retirement law that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this chapter, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.\n\n(B) Effective January 1, 2007, and notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary that otherwise would limit a distributee's election under this section, and to the extent allowed under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations, a distributee who is a designated beneficiary, but not a surviving spouse, spouse or former spouse alternate payee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have all or part of his benefit that qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an eligible retirement plan that is an individual retirement plan described in clause (i) or (ii) of Internal Revenue Code Section 402(c)(8)(B). If such a transfer is made:\n\n(1) the transfer shall be treated as an eligible rollover distribution;\n\n(2) the individual retirement plan shall be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 408(d)(3)(C); and\n\n(3) Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(B) other than clause (iv) thereof, shall apply to such individual retirement plan.\n\n(C) A \"designated beneficiary\" is an individual who is designated as a beneficiary under this chapter and is the designated beneficiary under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4 of the Treasury Regulations. An estate or revocable trust is not considered to be a designated beneficiary for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9).\n\n(D) An \"eligible rollover distribution\" is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:\n\n(1) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for the life or the life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more;\n\n(2) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9); and\n\n(3) any hardship distribution.\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, a portion of a distribution will not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a) or (b), or in a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover to a qualified trust under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or 403(a) that is part of a defined contribution or defined benefit plan, or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), so long as such trust or annuity contract separately accounts for amounts so transferred, including separate accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not includible. Effective January 1, 2008, an eligible rollover distribution also shall mean a qualified rollover contribution to a Roth IRA within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 408A.\n\n(E) Effective January 1, 2002, unless otherwise stated an \"eligible retirement plan\" is:\n\n(1) a plan eligible under Internal Revenue Code Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into the plan from the system;\n\n(2) an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a);\n\n(3) an individual retirement annuity described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b);\n\n(4) an annuity plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(a);\n\n(5) an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b);\n\n(6) a qualified trust described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; or\n\n(7) effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408A.\n\n(F) Effective January 1, 2002, the definition of eligible rollover distribution also includes a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a domestic relations order, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 414(p).\n\n(G) A \"distributee\" includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 414(p). Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an \"inherited\" individual retirement account or annuity.\n\n(H) A \"direct rollover\" is a payment by the system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 311, Section 20, eff June 4, 2008.",

Any other employer may, in its discretion, participate in the Supplemental Allowance Program by making application to the Board to so participate and by complying with the requirements of this section and the rules and regulations adopted by the Board for its implementation.

Such lump-sum amount shall be equal to the excess, if any, of his total accumulated supplemental contributions at the time his allowance commenced over the sum of the supplemental allowance payments made to him during his lifetime.\n\n(7) Should a member cease to render service as a police officer to an employer, except by reason of death or retirement, his aggregate supplemental contributions, if any, shall be paid to him in the manner and pursuant to the time limitations set forth in Section 9-11-100.\n\n(8) Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, a member who participates in the Supplemental Allowance Program may, in a manner similar to that set forth in Section 9-11-150, elect to convert the supplemental allowance otherwise payable on his account after his retirement into an allowance of equivalent actuarial value, in accordance with one of the options therein set forth.\n\n(9) Each member participating in the Supplemental Allowance Program shall make monthly supplemental contributions equal to six percent of the portion of the monthly salary or compensation in excess of four hundred dollars received by him during his participation in the program.\n\nIn addition, each such member may irrevocably elect, within a period of one month following his date of participation, to contribute the amount which would have resulted had he, during each month of his credited service prior to his date of participation, made a contribution to the System equal to two percent of the portion of his rate of monthly salary or compensation in excess of four hundred dollars during the month immediately preceding his date of participation in the program and had such contributions been accumulated with interest at the rate of four percent per annum.

The amount of employer contributions in any subsequent period shall be computed in a similar manner but the resulting amount shall be adjusted by the difference between the estimated amount of such member contributions and the amount of such contributions actually made. The estimate of the amount of contributions that will be made by the members during a period shall be based on the most recent payroll information available as of the date of the certification.\n\nThe participating employer shall make an additional level annual contribution for a period of ten years subsequent to its participation date. Such additional contributions shall, in total, be sufficient to liquidate an amount equal to the total contributions by its participating members with respect to their service prior to the employer's participation date. For the purpose of calculating this additional contribution an interest rate of four percent per annum shall be used.\n\nAny forfeitures shall be used to reduce the contributions otherwise payable by a particular participating employer, and will not be applied to increase the benefits of any participating member.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 61-343.1; 1966 (54) 2424; 2018 Act No. 149 (H.4869), Section 5, eff July 1, 2018.",

The chief fiscal officer of each employer shall transmit the amounts deducted to the System together with a schedule of the contributions, on forms prescribed by the Board, to reach the Retirement System on or before the last day of each month for the preceding month. If any employer fails to do so, or if arrears should at any time exist in making monthly payroll reports and remittances as required hereunder and by the rules and regulations of the Board, the compensation of any person or officer of any employer charged with the responsibility of making monthly payroll reports and remittances to the System must be withheld by the employer in each instance of failure to make the reports and remittances until all reports and remittances required hereunder and by the rules and regulations of the Board have been made. The System shall furnish monthly to the disbursing officers of each employer a statement of any failure to make payroll reports and remittances and the names of the persons or officers failing to make the reports and remittances.\n\nAny person failing to transmit, in the manner and within the period herein required, the contributions deducted is guilty of a misdemeanor and must be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court.\n\n(8) Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein, and shall receipt for his full salary or compensation, and payment of salary or compensation less such deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits provided under the System.\n\n(9) Each of the amounts so deducted shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose compensation the deduction was made.\n\n(10) Any employer may pay to the System on behalf of the members in its employ the amounts which such members would otherwise be required to contribute pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section in order to establish credit as Class Two service for any period of credited service prior to the date on which such members became eligible for Class Two membership or for participation in the Supplemental Allowance Program or any amounts which such members would otherwise be required to contribute pursuant to subsection (4) of this section in order to establish credit for any period of service prior to the date on which such members became eligible for membership. Such amounts contributed by an employer shall not be credited to the members' accumulated contributions, but in the event that a member's accumulated contributions are returned to him upon termination of his membership or are paid to the person designated by him upon his death prior to retirement, any amount contributed by the employer on behalf of the member pursuant to this subsection (10) shall be returned to said employer.\n\n(11) Each department and political subdivision shall pick up the employee contributions required by this section for all compensation paid on or after July 1, 1982, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining federal tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, each department and political subdivision is deemed to have taken formal action on or before January 1, 2009, to provide that the contributions on behalf of its employees, although designated as employer contributions, shall be paid by the employer in lieu of employee contributions. The department and political subdivision shall pay these employee contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the employee. The department and political subdivision may pick up these contributions by a reduction in the cash salary of the employee. The employee, however, must not be given the option of choosing to receive the contributed amount of the pickups directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system. Employee contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of this section in the same manner and to the extent as employee contributions made prior to the date picked up.\n\n(12) Payments for unused sick leave, single special payments at retirement, bonus and incentive-type payments, or any other payments not considered a part of the regular salary base are not compensation for which contributions are deductible. This item does not apply to bonus payments paid to certain categories of employees annually during their work careers. Bonus or special payments applied only during the \"Average Final Compensation\" period are excluded as compensation. Not including Class Three members, contributions are deductible on up to and including forty-five days' termination pay for unused annual leave. If a member has received termination pay for unused annual leave on more than one occasion, contributions are deductible on up to and including forty-five days' termination pay for unused annual leave for each termination payment for unused annual leave received by the member. However, only an amount up to and including forty-five days' pay for unused annual leave from the member's last termination payment shall be included in a member's average final compensation calculation for members eligible to have unused annual leave included in that calculation.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 61-344; 1962 (52) 1933; 1974 (58) 2032; 1977 Act No. 219 Pt II Section 26; 1982 Act No. 315, Section 4; 1982 Act No. 349, Section 4; 1982 Act No. 372, Section 3; 1985 Act No. 201, Part II, Sections 47F, and 48G; 1986 Act No. 529, Section 3, eff June 18, 1986; 1988 Act No. 424, Section 3, eff July 1, 1988; 1994 Act No. 420, Section 6, eff May 25, 1994 and applies with respect to payments made after June 30, 1995, to establish retirement system service credit; 2000 Act No. 387, Part II, Section 67P, eff January 1, 2001; 2005 Act No. 14, Section 4, eff July 1, 2004; 2008 Act No. 311, Section 22, eff June 4, 2008; 2012 Act No. 278, Pt III, Section 27, eff July 1, 2012.",

Such adjustments may be made without regard to the annual limit increase of one-half of one percent of earnable compensation provided pursuant to subsection (B).

However, the employee contribution rate may not be less than one-half of the normal cost for the system and any contribution reduction allowed by this item after the employee contribution rate equals one-half of the normal cost must be a reduction in the employer contribution rate.\n\n(2) If contribution rates are decreased pursuant to item (1) of this subsection and the most recent annual actuarial valuation of the system shows a funded ratio of less than eighty-five percent, then effective on the following July first, and annually after that time as necessary, the board shall increase the then current employer and employee contribution rates in equal amounts not exceeding one-half of one percent of earnable compensation in any one year until a subsequent annual actuarial valuation of the system shows a funded ratio that is equal to or greater than eighty-five percent.

If the form of benefit without regard to the automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is determined using the following assumptions and that take into account the death benefits under the form of benefit:\n\n(a) for a benefit paid in a form to which Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit which is the greater of (or the reduced Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date which is the lesser of when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions):\n\n(i) the annual amount of the straight life annuity if any payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the member; or\n\n(ii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using (aa) a five percent interest assumption or the applicable statutory interest assumption and (bb) the applicable mortality table described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) which is the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 for years prior to 2003 or, for subsequent years, in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62; or\n\n(b) for a benefit paid in a form to which Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e)(3) applies, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit which is the greatest of (or the reduced Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date which is the least of when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions):\n\n(i) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience;\n\n(ii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using (aa) a five and one-half percent interest assumption or the applicable statutory interest assumption and (bb) the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) which is the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 for years prior to 2003 or, for subsequent years, in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62; or\n\n(iii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using (aa) the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) which, prior to July 1, 2007, is the thirty-year treasury rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after July 1, 2007, is the thirty-year treasury rate effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period, and (bb) the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) which is the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 for years prior to 2003 or, for subsequent years, in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62, divided by 1.05; and\n\n(5) the member's annual benefit will be adjusted as provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(2)(B) and related treasury regulations by taking into consideration after-tax contributions and rollover and transfer contributions made by the member.\n\n(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the system may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Internal Revenue Code Section 415 by using the following methods:\n\n(1) if the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c) or 415(n);\n\n(2) if payment pursuant to item (1) shall not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c), the system may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution;\n\n(3) effective for permissive service credit contributions made in years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if:\n\n(a) the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b); or\n\n(b) the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c).\n\nFor purposes of applying subitem (a) the system shall not fail to meet the reduced limit under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection (D), and for purposes of applying subitem (b) the system shall not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) solely by reason of this subsection (D);\n\n(4) for purposes of subsection (D) the term \"permissive service credit\" means service credit:\n\n(a) recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the system;\n\n(b) which such member has not received under the system; and\n\n(c) which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit.\n\nEffective for permissive service credit contributions made in years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subitem (b), may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system;\n\n(5) the system will fail to meet the requirements of this subsection (D) if:\n\n(a) more than five years of nonqualified service credit are taken into account for purposes of this subsection (D); or\n\n(b) any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this subsection (D) before the member has at least five years of participation under the system;\n\n(6) for purposes of item (5), effective for permissive service credit contributions made in years beginning after December 31, 1997, the term \"nonqualified service credit\" means permissive service credit other than that allowed with respect to:\n\n(a) service, including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave, as an employee of the government of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing other than military service or service for credit which was obtained as a result of a repayment described in Internal Revenue Code Section 415(k)(3);\n\n(b) service, including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave, as an employee, other than as an employee described in subitem (a) of an education organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) which is a public, private, or sectarian school which provides elementary or secondary education through grade twelve, or a comparable level of education, as determined under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the service was performed; provided, however, that in the case of a private or sectarian school, only teaching service will not be treated as nonqualified service;\n\n(c) service as an employee of an association of employees who are described in subitem (a); or\n\n(d) military service, other than qualified military service under Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u), recognized by such governmental plan.\n\nIn the case of service described in subitem (a), (b), or (c), such service will be nonqualified service if recognition of such service would cause a member to receive a retirement benefit for the same service under more than one plan;\n\n(7) in the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31, 2001, to which Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) applies, without regard to whether the transfer is made between plans maintained by the same employer:\n\n(a) the limitations of item (5) shall not apply in determining whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit; and\n\n(b) the distribution rules applicable under federal law to the system will apply to such amounts and any benefits attributable to such amounts;\n\n(8) for an eligible member, the limitation of Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c)(1) shall not be applied to reduce the amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under the terms of the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of this item (8), an eligible member is an individual who first became a member in the system before July 1, 1998.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 311, Section 26, eff June 4, 2008.",
