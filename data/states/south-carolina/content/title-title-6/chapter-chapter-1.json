The local governing body shall enact an ordinance authorizing such purchase and the ordinance must state the nature and extent of the potential residential encroachment, how the purchased property or development rights would be used and specifically how and why this use would be beneficial to the United States military base, and what the impact would be to the United States military base if such purchase were not made. Millage rate increases for the purpose of such purchase must be separately stated on each tax bill and must specify the property, or the development rights to be purchased, the amount to be collected for such purchase, and the length of time that the millage rate increase will be in effect. The millage rate increase must reasonably relate to the purchase price and must be rescinded five years after it was placed in effect or when the amount specified to be collected is collected, whichever occurs first. The millage rate increase for such purchase may not be reinstated unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the governmental entity voting in a referendum.

The surcharge must be continued only for the years necessary to pay for the deficiency, for the catastrophic event, or for compliance with the court order or decree.\n\n(C) The millage increase permitted by subsection (B) is in addition to the increases from the previous year permitted pursuant to subsection (A) and shall be an additional millage levy above that permitted by subsection (A). The millage limitation provisions of this section do not apply to revenues, fees, or grants not derived from ad valorem property tax millage or to the receipt or expenditures of state funds.\n\n(D) The restriction contained in this section does not affect millage that is levied to pay bonded indebtedness or payments for real property purchased using a lease-purchase agreement or used to maintain a reserve account. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of energy-saving performance contracts as provided in Section 48-52-670.\n\n(E) Notwithstanding any provision contained in this article, this article does not and may not be construed to amend or to repeal the rights of a legislative delegation to set or restrict school district millage, and this article does not and may not be construed to amend or to repeal any caps on school millage provided by current law or statute or limitation on the fiscal autonomy of a school district that are more restrictive than the limit provided pursuant to subsection (A) of this section.\n\n(F) The restriction contained in this section does not affect millage imposed to pay bonded indebtedness or operating expenses of a special tax district established pursuant to Section 4-9-30(5), but the special tax district is subject to the millage rate limitations in Section 4-9-30(5).\n\n(G)(1) Notwithstanding the limitation upon millage rate increases contained in subsection (A), a fire district's governing body may adopt an ordinance or resolution requesting the governing body of the county to conduct a referendum to suspend the millage rate limitation for general operating purposes of the fire district.

The referendum must be held at the time of the general election, and upon a majority of the qualified voters within the fire district voting favorably in the referendum, the millage rate may be increased in the next fiscal year. The referendum must include the amount of the millage increase. The actual millage levy may not exceed the millage increase specified in the referendum.\n\n(2) This subsection only applies to a fire district that existed on January 1, 2014, and serves less than seven hundred homes.\n\n(H) Notwithstanding the limitation upon millage rate increases contained in subsection (A), the governing body of a county may adopt an ordinance, subject to a referendum, to suspend the millage rate limitation for the purpose of imposing up to six-tenths of a mill for mental health.

The state election laws apply to the referendum mutatis mutandis. This special millage may be removed only upon a majority vote of the local governing body. The amounts collected from the increased millage:\n\n(1) must be deposited into a mental health services fund separate and distinct from the county general fund and all other county funds;\n\n(2) must be dedicated only to expenditures for mental health services in the county; and\n\n(3) must not be used to supplant existing funds for mental health programs in the county.\n\nHISTORY: 1997 Act No. 138, Section 7; 1999 Act No. 114, Section 4; 2005 Act No. 145, Section 6, eff June 7, 2005; 2006 Act No. 388, Pt II, Section 2.A, eff January 1, 2007; 2007 Act No. 57, Section 3, eff June 6, 2007; 2007 Act No. 110, Section 34.A, eff June 21, 2007; 2007 Act No. 116, Section 40, eff June 28, 2007, applicable for tax years beginning after 2007; 2008 Act No. 410, Section 1, eff June 25, 2008; 2011 Act No. 57, Sections 2.A, 2.B, eff June 14, 2011; 2014 Act No. 249 (S.964), Sections 1. 2, eff June 6, 2014; 2016 Act No. 276 (H.4762), Section 1, eff June 15, 2016.",

If commissions are divided with other brokers or agents, then only the amount retained by the broker or agent is considered gross income.\n\n(c) \"Gross income for insurance companies\" means gross premiums written.\n\n(d) \"Gross income for manufacturers of goods or materials with a location in a taxing jurisdiction\" is the lesser of gross income collected from business done at the location, the amount of income allocated and apportioned to that location by the business for purposes of the business's state income tax return, or the amount of expenses attributable to the location as a cost center of the business. Manufacturers include those taxpayers reporting a manufacturing principal business activity code on their federal income tax returns.\n\n(e) Gross income for telecommunications providers is subject to the provisions of Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58.\n\n(2) Gross income for business license tax purposes may not include taxes collected for a governmental entity, escrow funds, or funds that are the property of a third party.

The Municipal Association of South Carolina shall determine and revise the Standardized Business License Class Schedule every even year using the latest available nationwide Internal Revenue Service statistics for the calculation of profitability of businesses and using the latest business classification codes of the latest North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n\n(2) A taxing jurisdiction, upon a finding of a rational basis as explained in its ordinance and by a positive majority vote of county or municipal council, may provide for additional reasonable subclassifications, described by an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, based upon particularized considerations as needed for economic stimulus or the enhanced or disproportionate demands by specific business subclassifications on taxing jurisdiction services or infrastructure.\n\n(H)(1) Any special ordinance, formal agreement, or informal agreement entered into between a taxing jurisdiction and a taxpayer regarding rate classes, an annual flat fee, or the calculation of business license taxes that was adopted by ordinance or agreed to before enactment of this subsection is considered valid upon the approval of the taxpayer. A taxpayer may prove the existence and terms of an agreement through direct or circumstantial evidence, including evidence of prior payment accepted.\n\n(2) This section does not impair or affect any future special business license ordinance passed for economic stimulus, an annual flat fee, or any future formal or informal agreement between a taxing jurisdiction and a taxpayer regarding the calculation of business license taxes.\n\n(I)(1) A taxing jurisdiction must establish its 2022 Business License Tax Rate Schedule using the gross income reported by businesses for a twelve-month period in the 2020 business license year so that the aggregate taxing jurisdiction business license tax calculated for 2022 does not exceed the aggregate taxing jurisdiction business license tax collected in 2020 from the same businesses.\n\n(2) If the rate for an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry is unchanged from 2020 to 2022, then the business license tax collections may be excluded from the calculation set forth in item (1).\n\n(J)(1) A taxing jurisdiction shall provide access to taxpayers for the reporting, calculation, and payment of business license taxes through the business license tax portal hosted and managed by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, subject to the availability and capability of the portal. Any limitations in portal availability or capability do not relieve taxpayers from existing business license or business license tax obligations. Any audit of income or assessment of tax reported through the business license tax portal must be undertaken by the taxing jurisdiction. Data obtained through the business license tax portal may not be used by parties other than the taxing jurisdictions for statewide analytics or any other purpose not specified in this section. Parties other than the taxing jurisdictions are prohibited from auditing a taxpayer using the business license tax portal. A taxing jurisdiction shall receive the entirety of the business license tax paid to it by a taxpayer through the business license tax portal. In addition to allowing a payment through the business license tax portal, a taxing jurisdiction shall allow a taxpayer to file and pay its business license tax in person at a location within the taxing jurisdiction, by telephone, by mail, or through an online payment system in existence on January 1, 2018, or prior, that is owned and operated by the taxing jurisdiction.\n\n(2) The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office is authorized to contract with software providers and payment processors for the purposes of implementing the provisions of this section. The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office may promulgate regulations to carry out the provisions of this section. The software provider may not retain any portion of the business license tax paid by the taxpayer to a taxing jurisdiction through the business license tax portal.\n\n(3) The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office is authorized to expend any funds carried forward from previous fiscal years for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this section. Expenditures may not exceed the actual cost of implementing the provisions of this section.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 176 (H.4431), Section 2, eff January 1, 2022.",

A private third-party entity is prohibited from assessing business license taxes or requiring a business entity to remit confidential business license tax data to that private third party on behalf of a taxing jurisdiction. This section may not prohibit a taxing jurisdiction from contracting with a third-party entity in assisting in the collection of business license taxes. For the purposes of this section, assisting in the collection of business license taxes is limited to a contractual agreement with a taxing jurisdiction for a third party to identify, through publicly available records, businesses that are operating within the contracting taxing jurisdiction without a business license, to provide that identification to a taxing jurisdiction, to communicate with those businesses identified to determine whether any business license taxes are due and owing, and to assist those businesses that owe a business license tax with paying the relevant taxing jurisdiction. The third party may also assist the contracting taxing jurisdiction with providing, by United States official mail or electronic mail, the taxing jurisdiction's business license form, along with a self-addressed envelope containing the taxing jurisdiction address, to identified businesses on behalf of the taxing jurisdiction. If a business requests in writing that the third party cease communication with the business, then the third party is strictly prohibited from any further contact. A third party assisting in the collection of business license taxes as defined in this section is prohibited from retaining personal or proprietary information from the identified business.\n\n(B) It is unlawful for any individual, firm, or organization to contact a business in this State regarding noncompliance with a business license ordinance unless the contact is made pursuant to a contract with a taxing jurisdiction in accordance with this section.\n\n(C) This section may not prohibit a taxing jurisdiction from contracting with a third party for the purpose of providing payment processing services for the acceptance of business license tax payments.\n\n(D) A taxing jurisdiction may enter into a contract with a third party to assist the taxing jurisdiction in collecting delinquent business license taxes which includes a contingency fee based on a percentage of taxes collected or otherwise depends on the specific result obtained provided the third party may not be paid on a contingency or success basis until the taxing jurisdiction issues a proposed assessment of business license taxes and the business fails to appeal the proposed assessment in a timely manner or the appeal is adjudicated. This section does not apply to the collection of business license taxes pursuant to Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58 and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38.\n\n(E) Except as needed for a third party to assess and collect business license taxes collected pursuant to Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58 and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38, a taxing jurisdiction may not share or disclose any information relating to business license tax applications with any third party other than to acknowledge whether or not a business has paid the taxing jurisdiction's business license tax for a relevant year. Nothing in this section should be construed as prohibiting a person or entity that gathers and disseminates news, as defined in Section 19-11-100, from obtaining the information not protected by Section 6-1-120 found on the business license tax application from the taxing jurisdiction.\n\n(F) A third-party entity contracting with a taxing jurisdiction to assist in identifying and collecting outstanding business license taxes may not engage in any conduct in which the natural consequence is to harass a business including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) contacting a business in any capacity after the business informs the third-party entity in writing to cease communication;\n\n(2) stating that a business is required to provide any information to the third-party entity; or\n\n(3) contacting the business in a manner that the third-party entity knows or should know creates any meaningful business interruption.\n\n(G) The provisions of subsection (A) do not apply to business license taxes collected pursuant to Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58 and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38.\n\n(H)(1) A person or entity may bring a private right of action:\n\n(a) based on a violation of this section or any regulations prescribed pursuant to this section to enjoin such violation;\n\n(b) to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive five hundred dollars in damages for each violation, whichever is greater; or\n\n(c) for both actions described in subitems (a) and (b).\n\n(2) If the court finds that a defendant wilfully or knowingly violated this section or any regulations prescribed pursuant to this section, then the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to no more than three times the actual monetary loss resulting from such violation.\n\nHISTORY: 2020 Act No. 176 (H.4431), Section 2, eff September 30, 2020.",
