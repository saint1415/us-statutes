(2) Obligations issued by the Federal Financing Bank, Federal Farm Credit Bank, the Bank of Cooperatives, the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Housing Administration, and the Farmers Home Administration, if, at the time of investment, the obligor has a long-term, unenhanced, unsecured debt rating in one of the top two ratings categories, without regard to a refinement or gradation of rating category by numerical modifier or otherwise, issued by at least two nationally recognized credit rating organizations. (3)(i) General obligations of the State of South Carolina or any of its political units; or (ii) revenue obligations of the State of South Carolina or its political units, if at the time of investment, the obligor has a long-term, unenhanced, unsecured debt rating in one of the top two ratings categories, without regard to a refinement or gradation of rating category by numerical modifier or otherwise, issued by at least two nationally recognized credit rating organizations. (4) Savings and Loan Associations to the extent that the same are insured by an agency of the federal government. (5) Certificates of deposit where the certificates are collaterally secured by securities of the type described in (1) and (2) above held by a third party as escrow agent or custodian, of a market value not less than the amount of the certificates of deposit so secured, including interest; provided, however, such collateral shall not be required to the extent the same are insured by an agency of the federal government. (6) Repurchase agreements when collateralized by securities as set forth in this section. (7) No load open-end or closed-end management type investment companies or investment trusts registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, where the investment is made by a bank or trust company or savings and loan association or other financial institution when acting as trustee or agent for a bond or other debt issue of that local government unit, political subdivision, or county treasurer if the particular portfolio of the investment company or investment trust in which the investment is made (i) is limited to obligations described in items (1), (2), (3), and (6) of this subsection, and (ii) has among its objectives the attempt to maintain a constant net asset value of one dollar a share and to that end, value its assets by the amortized cost method. (8) A political subdivision receiving Medicaid funds appropriated by the General Assembly in the annual general appropriations act may utilize appropriated funds and other monies generated by hospital operations to participate in principal protected investments in the form of notes, bonds, guaranteed investment contracts, debentures, or other contracts issued by a bank chartered in the United States or agency of a bank if chartered in the United States, financial institution, insurance company, or other entity which provides for full principal payment at the end of a contract term not to exceed twelve years if the issuer has received a rating in one of three highest general rating categories issued by no fewer than two nationally recognized credit rating organizations. No more than forty percent of the appropriated funds and other monies generated by hospital operations may be invested in the manner provided in this item. Revenue realized pursuant to these investments must be expended on health care services. (b) The provisions of this chapter shall not impair the power of a municipality, county, school district or other local governmental unit or political subdivision or county treasurer to hold funds in deposit accounts with banking institutions as otherwise authorized by law. (c) Such investments shall have maturities consistent with the time or times when the invested moneys will be needed in cash. (d) For purposes of subsection (a), in the case of a defeased obligation, an obligation shall be treated as the obligation of the issuer of the obligation included in the qualifying defeasance escrow for the defeased obligation. A \"defeased obligation\" means any obligation the payment of which is secured and payable solely from a qualifying defeasance escrow and the terms of which may not be amended or modified without the consent of each of the holders of the defeased obligation. A \"qualifying defeasance escrow\" means a deposit of securities, including defeasance obligations, with a trustee or similar fiduciary under the terms of an agreement that requires the trustee or fiduciary to apply the proceeds of any interest payments or maturity of the defeasance obligation to the payment of the defeased obligation and when the trustee or fiduciary has received verification from a certified public accountant that the payments will be sufficient to pay the defeased obligation timely. A defeasance obligation must not be callable or subject to prepayment by the issuer and it must be a direct general obligation of the United States and its agencies, or an obligation the payment of principal and interest on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United States.
