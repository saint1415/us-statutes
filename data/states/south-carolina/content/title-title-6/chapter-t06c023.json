This resolution or ordinance must be approved by a majority of the members of the governing body of the municipality. (2) In determining whether or not the creation of a joint agency for this purpose is in the best interests of the municipalities and their electric customers, the governing body shall take into consideration, but is not limited to, the following: (a) whether or not a separate entity may be able to finance the costs of a project or projects in a more efficient and economical manner; (b) whether or not a better financial market acceptance may result if one entity is responsible for issuing all of the bonds required for a project or projects in a timely and orderly manner; (c) whether or not savings and other advantages may be obtained by providing a separate entity responsible for the acquisition, purchase, construction, ownership, and operation of a project or projects. (3) If the proposed creation of a joint agency is found to be in the best interests of a municipality, the governing body of the municipality shall give notice of its action publishing once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality. A person affected by the action of the governing body of the municipality may challenge the action of the municipality, by action de novo, instituted in the court of common pleas for the county in which the municipality is located, within twenty days following the last publication of the notice prescribed in this section.

Notice of the filing of the petition must be given by the Public Service Commission once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the State. A hearing on the petition is to be conducted as provided by law. (B) The Public Service Commission is authorized to approve or disapprove the proposed acquisition by a joint agency of a project or projects which consist of an electric generating plant or plants and associated facilities designed for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of more than seventy-five megawatts, or which consist of electric transmission lines and associated facilities of a designed operating voltage of one hundred twenty-five kilovolts or more. There is no requirement for approval by the Public Service Commission for a project or projects for other transmission or generating facilities, or for facilities for distribution or transformation, or any of them, of electric power and energy. However, the joint agency may not acquire or purchase projects or capacity if, after the purchase or acquisition, the joint power agency would own, contract for, or control generating resources exceeding one hundred eighty-five percent of the member municipalities historical territorial peak. In determining whether it is beneficial to the joint agency, the Public Service Commission shall take into consideration, but is not limited to, the following: (1) the economies and efficiencies to be achieved in constructing on a large scale, facilities for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy; (2) the municipalities' needs for reserve and peaking capacity and to meet obligations under pooling and reserve-sharing agreements reasonably related to its needs for power and energy to which it is or may become a party; (3) the estimated useful life of the project; (4) the estimated time necessary for the planning, development, acquisition, or construction of the project and the length of time required in advance to obtain, acquire, or construct additional power supplies; (5) the reliability and availability of existing or alternative power supply sources and the costs of the existing or alternative power supply sources; (6) the load forecast of capacity of a project and the utilization of the capacity by the joint agency for a reasonable period of time subsequent to the date of commercial operation of the project; and (7) the effect of the proposed acquisition on the ability of the joint agency to satisfy existing financial and contractual obligations that it may have incurred in the acquisition of any previously acquired projects. (C) Any party in interest may appeal the commission's action pursuant to Sections 58-27-2310 to 58-27-2340 of the 1976 Code.

The representative, at the discretion of the municipality, may be an officer or employee of the municipality and may also serve ex officio as a member of the board of directors of the joint agency. Each director shall have not less than one vote and may have, in addition thereto, such additional votes as a majority of the members of the joint agency shall determine. Each director shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body by which he was appointed. Each appointed director, before entering upon his duties, shall take and subscribe to an oath before a person authorized by law to administer oaths to execute the duties of his office faithfully and impartially, and a record of each such oath shall be filed with the governing body of the appointing municipality. The board of directors of the joint agency shall annually elect, with each representative of member municipalities having one vote, one of the directors as chairman, another as vice chairman and another person or persons who may but need not be directors as treasurer, secretary, and, if desired, assistant secretary. The office of treasurer may be held by the secretary or assistant secretary. The board of directors may also appoint such additional officers as it deems necessary. The secretary or assistant secretary of the joint agency shall keep a record of the proceedings of the joint agency, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all books, records, documents and papers filed with the joint agency, the minute book or journal of the joint agency and its official seal. A majority of the directors of the joint agency then in office shall constitute a quorum. A vacancy on the board of directors of the joint agency shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all rights and perform all the duties of a joint agency. Any action taken by the joint agency under the provisions of this chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting held pursuant to notice in accordance with bylaws of the joint agency, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. Except as is otherwise provided in this act or in the bylaws of the joint agency, a majority of the votes which the directors present are entitled to cast, with a quorum present, shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution. No director of a joint agency shall receive any compensation for the performance of duties hereunder, provided, however, that each director may be paid per diem and subsistence expenses incurred while engaged in the performance of such duties. (b) After the creation of a joint agency, any other municipality may become a member thereof (1) upon application to such joint agency; (2) upon compliance with the provisions of Section 6-23-20; and (3) with the unanimous consent of the members of the joint agency evidenced by the resolutions of their respective governing bodies. Notice of additional members shall be given to the Public Service Commission. (c) Any municipality may withdraw from the joint agency, provided, however, that all contractual rights acquired and contractual obligation incurred by a municipality while such municipality was a member shall remain in full force and effect. Whenever the board of directors of a joint agency and the governing body of each of its member municipalities shall by resolution or ordinance determine that the purposes for which the joint agency was formed have been substantially fulfilled and that all bonds theretofore issued and all other obligations theretofore incurred by the joint agency have been fully paid or satisfied, such board of directors and governing bodies may declare the joint agency to be dissolved. On the effective date of such resolution or ordinance, the title to all funds and other property owned by the joint agency at the time of such dissolution shall vest in the member municipalities of the joint agency as provided in this chapter and the bylaws of the joint agency.

The board of directors of the joint agency may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by a trustee or fiscal agent. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in fully registered form, or both, as the governing body of the issuer may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to the principal alone and also as to both principal and interest; and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds.

The joint agency may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The joint agency may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall have become mutilated or shall have been destroyed or lost. (c) Bonds may be issued under provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent or approval of the State or any political subdivision or any agency, commission or instrumentality thereof.
