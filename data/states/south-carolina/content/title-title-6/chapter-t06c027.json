      "text": "(A) In the annual general appropriations act, the General Assembly must appropriate funds to the Local Government Fund. (B)(1) In any fiscal year in which general fund revenues are projected to increase or decrease, the appropriation to the Local Government Fund for the upcoming fiscal year must be adjusted by the same projected percentage change, but not to exceed five percent, when compared to the appropriation in the current fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, beginning with the initial forecast required pursuant to Section 11-9-1130, the percentage adjustment in general fund revenues must be determined by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office by comparing the current fiscal year's recurring general fund expenditure base with the Board of Economic Advisors' most recent projection of recurring general fund revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. Upon the issuance of the initial forecast, the Executive Director of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, or his designee, shall notify the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Governor of the projected percentage adjustment. The executive director, or his designee, shall provide similar notice if subsequent modifications to the forecast change the projected percentage adjustment. However, the forecast in effect on February fifteenth of the current fiscal year is the final forecast for which the percentage adjustment is determined, and no subsequent forecast modifications shall have any effect on that determination. (2) The Governor shall include the appropriation required by this chapter to the Local Government Fund in the Executive Budget. (3) The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office shall determine the current fiscal year's recurring general fund expenditure base, and determine any projected adjustment in general fund revenues. If a change is projected, the appropriation for the upcoming fiscal year must be adjusted accordingly. (C) For purposes of this section: (1) \"Recurring general fund revenue\" means the forecast of recurring general fund revenues pursuant to Section 11-9-1130 after the amount apportioned to the Trust Fund for Tax Relief, as required in Section 11-11-150, is deducted. (2) \"Recurring general fund expenditure base\" means the total recurring general fund appropriations authorized in the current general appropriations act less any reduced appropriations mandated by the General Assembly or the Executive Budget Office pursuant to Section 11-9-1140(B).
