      "text": "As used in this chapter: (1) \"Assessment\" means a charge against the real property belonging to an owner within an improvement district created pursuant to this chapter. The assessment must be made upon real property located within the district, other than property constituting improvements within the meaning of this section, and may be based upon assessed value, front footage, area per parcel basis, the value of improvements to be constructed within the district, or a combination of them, or another basis agreed to between the owner and the governing body, as the basis is determined by the governing body of the county. An assessment imposed under this chapter remains valid and enforceable in accordance with the provisions of this chapter even if there is a later subdivision and transfer of the relevant property or a part of it. An improvement plan may provide for a change in the basis of assessment upon the subdivision or transfer of real property, or upon such other event as may be deemed appropriate by the governing body. The rates of assessments within a district need not be uniform. The owner and the governing body shall agree upon the rates of assessment across different sections of, or uses within, the district. (2) \"Improvements\" include, but are not limited to, public infrastructure improvements, such as a parkway, park, and playground; a recreation facility, athletic facility, and pedestrian facility; sidewalk; parking facility ancillary to another public facility; facade redevelopment; storm drain; the relocation, construction, widening, and paving of a street, road, and bridge including demolition of them; underground utility dedicated or to be dedicated to public use; all improvements permitted under Chapter 35, Title 4 and Chapter 37, Title 5; a building or other facility for public use; public works eligible for financing under the provisions of Section 6-21-50; and things incidental to an improvement including, but not limited to, planning, engineering, promotion, marketing, administrative fees, and acquisition of necessary easements and land, and may include a facility for lease or use by a private person, firm, or corporation. Improvements also include the construction of a new public school and the renovation and expansion of an existing public school. However, except as otherwise provided in this item, maintenance and an operational expense are not considered to be improvements. The construction of the improvements must comply with applicable state and federal law and regulations governing the construction of similar public improvements installed or constructed by a private entity. Improvements may be designated by the governing body as public works eligible for revenue bond financing pursuant to Section 6-21-50, and these improvements, taken in the aggregate, may be designated by the governing body as a \"system\" of related projects within the meaning of Section 6-21-40. The governing body, after due investigation and study, may determine that improvements located outside the boundaries of a district confer a benefit upon property inside a district or are necessary to make improvements within the district effective for the benefit of property inside the district. Improvements must service primarily an owner of the property within the district. This requirement is met if the improvements are situated within: (a) the district; or (b) a designated service area that benefits the district. (3) \"Improvement plan\" means an overall plan by which the governing body proposes and the owner accepts to effect improvements within a district and service area to preserve property values, prevent deterioration of urban areas, and preserve the tax base, and includes an overall plan by which the governing body proposes to effect improvements within an improvement district in order to encourage and promote private or public development within the improvement district. (4) \"District\" means an area within the county or municipality designated by the governing body and proposed by petition and approved by the governing body pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and within which an improvement plan is to be accomplished. A district may be comprised of noncontiguous parcels of land. A district may be made up of varying proposed land uses including, but not limited to, residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, or a combination of some or all of those. A district may not include the grounds of the State House in the City of Columbia. Multiple districts may not be formed over the same property at the same time. (5) \"Governing body\" means, as appropriate, the county council or the municipal council or councils with authority over the geographic area in which the district lies and acting under this chapter. School boards are not included within the definition of governing body under this chapter. (6) \"Government entity\" means the county or municipality in which the district is located and the governing body of which acts under this chapter to create such district and impose assessments therein. (7) \"Owner\" means any person eighteen years of age, or older, or the proper legal representative for any person younger than eighteen years of age or otherwise incapacitated person as defined in Section 62-5-101(1), and any firm or corporation, who or which owns legal title to a present possessory interest in real estate equal to a life estate or greater, expressly excluding leaseholds, easements, equitable interests, inchoate rights, dower rights, and future interests, and who owns, at the date of the petition required by Section 6-35-118, at least an undivided one-tenth interest in a single tract and whose name appears on the county tax records as an owner of real estate, and any duly organized group whose total interest is equal to at least a one-tenth interest in a single tract. (8) \"Service area\" means, based on sound planning or engineering principles, or both, a defined geographic area served by a particular improvement. A provision in this chapter may not be interpreted to alter, enlarge, or reduce the service area or boundaries of a political subdivision that is authorized or set by law. A service area may consist of tracts in more than one state, county, or municipality, provided that each relevant governing body approves the creation of the service area and the district. Each improvement may have its own specific service area. HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 350, Section 1, eff upon approval (became law without the Governor's signature on June 17, 2008).",

Hearings may be conducted by one or more members of the governing body, but the final decision on each such objection shall be made by vote of the governing body at a public session. (B) As soon as practicable after the completion of the assessment roll and prior to the publication of the notice provided in the preceding paragraph, the governing body shall mail by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of each lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is to be levied, at the address appearing on the records of the city or county treasurer, a notice stating the nature of the improvements, the maximum total proposed cost thereof, and the maximum amount to be assessed against the particular property. The notice shall contain a brief description of the particular property involved, together with a statement that the amount assessed shall constitute a lien against the property superior to all other liens except property taxes.

(D) Upon the confirmation of an assessment, if any, the governing body shall mail a written notice of the amount of the assessment finally confirmed to all persons who have filed written objections as hereinabove provided. Such property owner may appeal such assessment only if he shall, within twenty days after the mailing of the notice to him confirming the assessment, give written notice to the governing body of his intent to appeal his assessment to the court of common pleas of the county in which the property is situate; but no such appeal shall delay or stay the construction of improvements or affect the validity of the assessments confirmed and not appealed. Appeals shall be heard and determined on the record in the manner of appeals from administrative bodies in this State. (E) Following the completion of the assessment roll, the requirements of this section as to notice and hearing may be waived upon the filing with the governing body of a waiver signed by all owners of property within the district as of the date of filing of such waiver. Such waiver shall for each parcel in the district state the maximum assessment to be imposed thereupon and all owners of such parcel. Such waiver shall contain a statement that the persons signing the waiver intend thereby to waive all rights to notice, hearing, and appeal otherwise available under Section 6-35-180.
