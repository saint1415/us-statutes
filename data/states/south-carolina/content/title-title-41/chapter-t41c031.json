(2) \"Benefit cost rate\" means the rate determined by dividing the unemployment compensation benefits paid during a calendar year by the total covered wages in the State during that year. The calculation of the benefit cost rate may not include the wages and unemployment compensation paid by employers covered under Section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (3) \"Income needed to pay benefits\" means the estimate of benefits payable in a given calendar year less the estimate of interest to be earned by the unemployment insurance trust fund for that calendar year. (4) \"Statewide reserve ratio\" means the ratio determined by dividing the balance in the trust fund reserve as of June thirtieth by the total covered wages for the previous twelve months in the State as of June thirtieth. The calculation of the statewide reserve ratio may not include the wages and unemployment compensation paid by employers covered under Section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (5) \"Fund adequacy target\" means an average high-cost multiple of one. (6) \"Trust fund reserve\" excludes distributions from the federal government pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1103, commonly referred to as the Reed Act. (B) For each calendar year during which the state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund is in debt status, the department must estimate the amount of income necessary to pay benefits for that year, the amount of income necessary to avoid automatic FUTA credit reductions, and an amount of income necessary to repay all outstanding federal loans within five years. Additional estimates of interest costs shall be determined concurrently. (1) Estimates of the revenue needed to pay benefits will be based on Congressional Budget Office projections for the subsequent calendar year's total unemployment rate. This total unemployment rate will be adjusted for South Carolina based on the historic relationship between the unemployment rate in South Carolina and the national unemployment rate calculated from 1980 to present. (2) The historic relationship, calculated from 1980 to present, between the total unemployment rate and the insured unemployment rate in South Carolina will be used to adjust the projected total unemployment rate to the rate of insured unemployment. (3) Estimates of forecasted benefits will be based upon the prior three year average of the annual number of weeks compensated multiplied by an estimate of the average weekly benefit for the next year. (4) Estimates of amounts to pay to avoid FUTA credit reductions and amount of repayments on the loan will be projected through consultation with officials at the US Department of Labor. (C) After the fund returns to solvency, the department must promulgate regulations concerning the income needed to pay benefits in each year and return the trust fund to an adequate level as defined in subsection (A)(5).

      "text": "Each employer eligible for a rate computation shall have his tax rate determined in the following manner: (1)(a)(i) Annually the department must calculate a contribution rate for each employer qualified for an experience rating. The contribution rate must correspond to the rate calculated for the employer's benefit ratio class. (ii) To determine an employer's benefit ratio rank, the department must list all employers by increasing benefit ratios, from the lowest benefit ratio to the highest benefit ratio. The list must be divided into classes ranked one through twenty. Each class must contain approximately five percent of the total taxable wages, excluding employers with less than twelve months of accomplished liability, employers with outstanding tax liens, delinquent tax class employers, and employers who reimburse the department in lieu of contributions, paid in covered employment during the four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date. Each employer must be placed in the class that corresponds with the employer's benefit ratio. (iii) If an employer's taxable wages qualify the employer for two separate classes, the employer shall be afforded the class assigned the lower contribution rate. Employers with identical benefit ratios shall be assigned to the same class. (b) The income needed to pay benefits for the calendar year plus any applicable income needed to reach the solvency target must be divided by the estimated taxable wages for the calendar year. The result rounded to the next higher one-hundredth of one percent is the average required rate needed to pay benefits and achieve solvency targets. (c) The rate for class twenty will be set such that the entire schedule raises the income required to pay benefits for the year, as well as the income necessary to move the trust fund toward the solvency target, subject to the structure provided in this chapter. However, the rate for class twenty must be at least five and four-tenths percent. (2)(a) If the calculated rate necessary for benefit rate class twenty exceeds five and four-tenths percent, then the rate for each preceding benefit rate class shall be equal to ninety percent of the rate calculated for the succeeding class, except that rate class twelve shall be set at one-fourth the rate calculated for class twenty, provided that the rate for class one shall be zero. (b)(i) If the computed rate necessary for class twenty is less than five and four-tenths percent, then the rate for class twenty shall be set at five and four-tenths percent. (ii) The rate for rate class twelve shall be calculated by multiplying the average tax rate computed in item (1)(b) by twenty, subtracting five and four-tenths percent, and dividing by nineteen. (iii) The contribution rate for rate classes eleven through one shall be equal to ninety percent of the rate for the succeeding class, provided that the rate for class one shall be zero. (iv) The contribution rate for class thirteen shall be equal to one hundred twenty percent of the rate calculated for rate class twelve. (v) The contribution rate for rate class nineteen shall be set at an amount that allows for average contributions, beginning with class eighteen and ending with class fourteen, that are equal to ninety percent of the preceding class. (3) For calendar year 2011 and any subsequent calendar year, voluntary payments are not permitted for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of required contributions. (4) For tax year 2011, no employer shall have a base tax rate higher than the base tax rate for rate class twelve if during the applicable rate computation period, as defined in Section 41-31-5, the employer has been credited with more in tax contributions than have been charged to that employer's account for benefits.

No pursuit shall be considered seasonal until the department makes a determination that the pursuit is seasonal. However, any successor to a seasonal pursuit shall be deemed seasonal unless the successor requests cancellation of the seasonal pursuit status within one hundred twenty days after the acquisition. This provision shall not be applicable to pending cases nor retroactive in effect. (2) Upon application by a pursuit for seasonal pursuit status, the department shall determine or redetermine whether the pursuit is seasonal and, if seasonal, the pursuit's active period. The department may, on its own motion, redetermine a seasonal pursuit's active period. An application for a seasonal determination must be made on forms prescribed by the department and must be made at least thirty days prior to the beginning date of the period of production operations for which a determination is requested. (3) Whenever the department has determined or redetermined a pursuit to be seasonal, the pursuit shall be notified immediately, and the notice must contain the beginning and ending dates of the pursuit's active period or periods. Pursuits determined or redetermined to be a seasonal pursuit shall display notices of its seasonal determination conspicuously on its premises in a sufficient number of places to be available for inspection by its workers. The notices shall be furnished by the department. (4) A seasonal determination must become effective unless an interested party files an application for review within ten days of the beginning date of the first period of production operations to which it applies. An application for review shall be an application for a determination of status. (5) All wages paid to a seasonal worker during his base period must be used in determining his weekly benefit amount; provided, however, that all weekly benefit amounts so determined shall be rounded to the nearest lower full dollar amount, if not a full dollar amount. (6)(a) A seasonal worker is eligible to receive benefits based on seasonal wages only for a week of unemployment which occurs, or the greater part of which occurs, within the active period of the seasonal pursuit in which he earned base period wages. (b) A seasonal worker is eligible to receive benefits based on nonseasonal wages for any week of unemployment which occurs during any active period of the seasonal pursuit in which he has earned base period wages; provided he has exhausted benefits based on seasonal wages. The worker is also eligible to receive benefits based on nonseasonal wages for any week of unemployment which occurs during the inactive period or periods of the seasonal pursuit in which he earned base period wages irrespective as to whether he has exhausted benefits based on seasonal wages. (c) The maximum amount of benefits which a seasonal worker is eligible to receive, based on seasonal wages, shall be an amount, adjusted to the nearest multiple of one dollar, determined by multiplying the maximum benefits payable in his benefit year, as provided in Section 41-35-50, by the percentage obtained by dividing the seasonal wages in his base period by all of his base period wages. (d) The maximum amount of benefits which a seasonal worker is eligible to receive based on nonseasonal wages shall be an amount, adjusted to the nearest multiple of one dollar, determined by multiplying the maximum benefits payable in his benefit year, as provided in Section 41-35-50, by the percentage obtained by dividing the nonseasonal wages in his base period by all of his base period wages. (e) In no case is a seasonal worker eligible to receive a total amount of benefits in a benefit year in excess of the maximum benefits payable for such benefit year, as provided in Section 41-35-50. (7)(a) All benefits paid to a seasonal worker based on seasonal wages shall be charged, as prescribed in Section 41-31-20, against the account of his base period employer who paid him such seasonal wages, and for the purpose of this paragraph such seasonal wages shall be deemed to constitute all of his base period wages. (b) All benefits paid to a seasonal worker based on nonseasonal wages shall be charged, as prescribed in Section 41-31-20, against the account of his base period employer who paid him such nonseasonal wages, and for the purpose of this paragraph such nonseasonal wages shall be deemed to constitute all of his base period wages. (8) The benefits payable to any otherwise eligible individual shall be calculated in accordance with this section for any benefit year which is established on or after the beginning date of a seasonal determination applying to a pursuit by which such individual was employed during the base period applicable to such benefit year, as if such determination had been effective in such base period. (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of any individual whose claim for benefits is determined in accordance herewith to appeal from such determination as provided in Section 41-35-660. (10) As used in this section: (a) \"Pursuit\" means an employer or branch of an employer. (b) \"Branch of an employer\" means a part of an employer's activities which is carried on or is capable of being carried on as a separate enterprise. (c) \"Production operations\" means all the activities of a pursuit which are primarily related to the production of its characteristic goods or services. (d) \"Active period or periods\" of a seasonal pursuit means the longest regularly recurring period or periods within which production operations of the pursuit are customarily carried on. (e) \"Seasonal wages\" means the wages earned in a seasonal pursuit within its active period or periods. The department may prescribe by regulation the manner in which seasonal wages shall be reported. (f) \"Seasonal worker\" means a worker at least twenty- five percent of whose base period wages are seasonal wages. (g) \"Interested party\" means any individual affected by a seasonal determination. (h) \"Inactive period or periods\" of a seasonal pursuit means that part of a calendar year which is not included in the active period or periods of such pursuit. (i) \"Nonseasonal wages\" means the wages earned in a seasonal pursuit within the inactive period or periods of such pursuit, or wages earned at any time in a nonseasonal pursuit.

The employing unit must be assigned the same rate as the predecessor, or the predecessor who has the highest base rate if there is more than one predecessor employing unit with different base rates. (1) For purposes of this section control of the business enterprise may occur by means of ownership of the organization conducting the business enterprise, ownership of assets necessary to conduct the business enterprise, security arrangements or lease arrangements covering assets necessary to conduct the business enterprise, including workers, or a contract when the ownership, stated arrangements, or contract provide for or allow direction of the internal affairs or conduct of the business enterprise. (2) For purposes of this section continuity of control exists if one or more persons, entities, or other organizations controlling the business enterprise remain in control of the business enterprise after an acquisition or change in form or there is a transfer to persons within the first degree of kinship to the transferors. Evidence of continuity of control includes, but is not limited to, changes of an individual proprietorship to a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, or estate; a partnership to an individual proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, association, estate, or the addition, deletion, or change of partners; a limited liability company to an individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, estate, or to another limited liability company; a corporation to an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, association, estate, or to another corporation or from any form to another form. (B) An employing unit must not be assigned any portion of the employment benefit record of an existing employing unit upon the acquisition of that established business or of an identifiable and segregable part of that established business if: (1) the acquiring person was not otherwise an employer at the time of the acquisition; (2) the person has no substantial commonality of interest, including ownership or management, in the business acquired; and (3) the department finds that the person acquired the business or an identifiable and segregable part of the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. (C) If the experience rating account of the predecessor is equal to or exceeds tax class thirteen, the experience rating account of the predecessor employer in any event must be transferred to the successor employer in accordance with the provisions of Section 41-31-140. (D)(1) An employing unit that knowingly attempts to violate the provisions of this section must be assessed a penalty in an amount equal to the greater of one thousand dollars or ten percent of the tax determined by the department to be due for each report that is submitted in violation of this section. For the purposes of this section, the terms \"knowingly\" or \"knowing\" mean having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibition in this section. This penalty may be recovered in the manner provided in Article 3 of this chapter for the collection of other penalties. Officers and directors of the enterprise comprising the employing unit are individually liable for the penalties assessed pursuant to this subsection. (2) A contribution tax return preparer who violates this section or provides advice to an employing unit that results in a knowing violation of the provisions of this section is liable for a penalty of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for each report submitted in violation of this section. This penalty may be recovered by the department in an appropriate civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. (3) As used in this section, a \"contribution tax return preparer\" is a person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more persons to prepare for compensation, any contribution and wage report or report of change in the status of an employing unit required by this chapter or any claim for credit for a tax imposed by this chapter. For purposes of this definition, the completion of a substantial portion of a report is treated as the preparation of the entire report. The term does not include a person merely because the person furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance, prepares a report of the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed, prepares as a fiduciary a report for any person, or represents a taxpayer in a hearing regarding an issue arising under this chapter.

(1) At the end of each calendar quarter the department shall bill each nonprofit organization (or group of such organizations) which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter, and effective January 1, 1979, with respect to the State or any political subdivision or any instrumentality thereof as defined in Section 41-27-230(2)(b) the full amount of regular and extended benefits attributable to services performed in its employ. (2) Each nonprofit organization that has elected payment of benefits in lieu of contributions shall further elect for the same period to make such payments in accordance with one of the following two methods: (a) payment of any bill rendered under subsection (1) of this section in accordance with subsection (3) of this section; or (b) payment of two percent of the quarterly taxable payroll of the nonprofit organization to the department within thirty days after the close of each such calendar quarter. The department shall apply such funds to the payment of bills rendered to the nonprofit organization under subsection (1) of this section. At the end of each calendar year, the department shall determine whether the total of payments for such year made by the nonprofit organization is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals during such calendar year, and effective January 1, 1979, with respect to the State or any political subdivision or any instrumentality thereof as defined in Section 41-27-230(2)(b) the full amount of all regular and extended benefits paid to individuals during such calendar year based on wages attributable to service in its employment. Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year are less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the calendar year, all or a part of the excess may, at the discretion of the department, be refunded from the fund or retained in the fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next calendar year. (3) Payment of any bill rendered under either subsection (2)(a) or subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill is mailed to the last known address of the nonprofit organization or is otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. (4) Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this section shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization. (5) The amount due specified in any bill from the department shall be conclusive on the organization unless, not later than fifteen days after the bill was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the department setting forth the grounds for the application. After affording the organization a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing consonant with the provisions of Section 41-35-720, the department shall by its decision make findings of fact and conclusion of law and upon the basis thereof affirm, modify, or reverse its original ruling with respect to the amount originally specified in the bill. Within fifteen days after the date upon which the decision is issued the organization may procure judicial review of the decision by commencing an action in the court of common pleas in any county in which the organization has a place of business against the department for the review of its decision. In such action a petition, which need not be verified, but which shall state the grounds upon which a review is sought, shall be served upon a member of the department or upon a person as the department shall designate. With its answer the department shall certify and file with the court all evidence and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter together with its findings of fact and decision therein. In any judicial proceeding under this section the decision of the court shall be based upon the evidence introduced and the testimony received at the hearing before the department. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the court of common pleas in the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules. A petition for judicial review shall act as a supersedeas or stay of any action by the department directed toward the collection of the amount involved in the controversy or the imposition of any penalty or forfeiture by reason of the nonpayment thereof. (6) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that, pursuant to Section 41-31-370, apply to past due contributions. (7) All of the provisions of Section 41-31-360, applicable to the adjustment or refund of contributions and interest paid or collected, and not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, shall be applicable to payments in lieu of contributions and interest erroneously paid by a nonprofit organization. (8) All of the remedies, powers, and means available to the department under the provisions of Sections 41-31-380, 41-31-390, 41-31-400, 41-31-410, and 41-31-420 to enforce the payment of contributions, interest, penalties, and costs are applicable to the enforcement of payments in lieu of contributions and interest due under the provisions of this section, and for the purposes of this item the term \"contributions\" which appears in any such sections means \"payment in lieu of contributions\" in all particulars. (9) In the event any governmental entity which is a covered employer under the terms of this chapter and Article 5, Chapter 35 becomes delinquent in payments due under this chapter and Article 5, Chapter 35, upon due notice, and upon certification of the delinquency by the department to the State Treasurer or any other department or agency of the State holding funds that may be payable to the delinquent governmental entity, the amount of such delinquency shall be deducted from any such funds in the hands of the State Treasurer or other department or agency and paid to the department in satisfaction of such delinquency.

(2) Any bond deposited under this subsection shall be in force for a period of not less than two calendar years and shall be renewed with the approval of the department, at such times as the department may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The department shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as it deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date of notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in Section 41-31-630(6), shall render the surety liable on such bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization. (3) Any deposit of money in accordance with this subsection shall be retained by the department in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The department may deduct from the money deposited under this subsection by a nonprofit organization to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in Section 41-31-630(6). The department shall require the organization within fifteen days following any deduction from a money deposit under the provisions of this subsection to deposit sufficient additional money to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. The department may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, it determines that an adjustment is necessary, it shall require the organization to make an additional deposit within fifteen days of written notice of its determination or shall return to the organization such portion of the deposit as it no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate.
