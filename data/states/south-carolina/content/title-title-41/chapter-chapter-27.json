The General Assembly therefore declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this State require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the State, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 68-38; 1952 Code Section 68-36; 1942 Code Section 7035-82; 1936 (39) 1716; 1941 (42) 369.",

The department must prescribe regulations applicable to unemployed individuals, making such distinctions in the procedures as to total unemployment, part-total unemployment, partial unemployment of individuals attached to their regular jobs, and other forms of short-time work, as the department considers necessary.\n\n(2) An individual is considered \"unemployed\" in a week during which no governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment attributable to his employment is payable to him or, if that payment is payable to him with respect to those weeks, the amount of it is less than his weekly benefit amount. An eligible individual who is unemployed in a week and is receiving a government or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment attributable to his employment must be paid with respect to this week a benefit in an amount equal to his weekly benefit amount less the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment payable to him with respect to such week. This benefit, if not a multiple of one dollar, must be computed to the next lower multiple of one dollar. The amount of benefits payable to an individual for a week that begins after the effective date of the applicable provision in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and that begins in a period with respect to which this individual is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment based on the previous work of the individual must be reduced not below zero but by an amount equal to the amount of this pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other payment which is reasonably attributable to such week.

As a result, the offset of social security will be reduced from fifty to zero percent based on the fact that individuals are required to contribute to social security.\n\n(3) An individual may not be considered unemployed in a week in which the department finds that his unemployment is due to a vacation week with respect to which the individual is receiving or has received his regular wages.

This provision applies only if the department finds employment will be available for the claimant with the employer at the end of a vacation period as described in this section.
