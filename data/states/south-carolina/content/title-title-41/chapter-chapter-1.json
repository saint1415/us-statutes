This act must be known and may be cited as the 'South Carolina Lactation Support Act'.\"\n\n\"SECTION 2. It is the intent of the General Assembly, by this act, to promote public health and to support those who wish to express breast milk at work by requiring employers to make reasonable efforts to provide workers with reasonable unpaid break time and space to express milk at work. This act will not require employers to compensate employees for breaks taken to express breast milk unless the employer already provides compensated breaks and does not require employers to create a permanent or dedicated space for use by pumping employees. South Carolina ranks far lower than the national average of breastfed infants. Providing workers reasonable support to express milk on the job is a crucial health measure and will benefit South Carolina's economy by keeping nursing employees in the workforce.\"\n\n\"SECTION 4.
