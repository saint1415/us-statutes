A transfer of the promissory note or other instrument secured by the mortgage or other security instrument by an assignment of note to such an institution, which assignment of note constitutes an effective transfer or assignment under the laws of this State, constitutes an effective assignment of the mortgage or other security instrument. The assignee of the note is entitled to enforce all obligations contained in the promissory note or other agreement and possesses all of the rights of the assignor in the mortgage or other security instrument given to a Farm Credit System institution, including the right to foreclose the instrument in accordance with law without restriction. The provisions of this section do not preclude the recordation of a written assignment of a mortgage or other security instrument with or without the promissory note or other instrument that it secures.\n\n(C) The execution of a written document containing an assignment of note is valid and enforceable from the time of execution to pass the interest granted, pledged, assigned, or transferred in the note and the mortgage securing the note as against the assignor, and the transfer is perfected from the time of execution against subsequent assignees, lien creditors, and purchasers for valuable consideration from the assignor; provided, however, that service of process on a Farm Credit System institution that is a mortgagee of record in any foreclosure action, or other action affecting title to the underlying real estate collateral, must be deemed sufficient service to any Farm Credit System institution that is assignee of such mortgage and underlying note as provided herein.\n\n(D) Where an assignment of note is a collateral assignment, after a default under the loan agreement, financing agreement, security agreement, or other evidence of indebtedness which the assignment secures, the assignee is thereafter entitled, but not required, to collect and receive any accrued and unpaid or subsequently accruing note payments and to foreclose the mortgage securing the note subject to the assignment without need for the appointment of a receiver, any act to take possession of the note, or any further demand on the assignor or maker of the note. Unless otherwise agreed, after default the assignee is entitled to notify the maker or other obligor to make payment to the assignee and is also entitled to have possession of any payments or proceeds to which the assignee may be entitled.\n\n(E) This section does not exclude other methods of creating, perfecting, collecting, sequestering, or enforcing a security interest in notes and mortgages provided by the laws of this State.\n\n(F) For documents executed on or after the effective date of this section, the provisions of this section providing that the assignment of mortgages need not be recorded must be reflected in the mortgage in bold print.\n\nHISTORY: 1994 Act No. 398, Section 1.",
