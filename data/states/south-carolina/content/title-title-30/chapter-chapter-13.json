Such recordation of the list of signatures so furnished shall be equivalent to the recordation in extenso of the contract or agreement of each signer thereof. Such copy of such contracts or agreements and such list of names of persons appearing on such contracts as signers thereof and statement of notations shall be sworn to by some officer of the association cognizant of the facts before some officer authorized to take acknowledgments to deeds.
