      "text": "(A) Any intervention by the State into family life on behalf of children must be guided by law, by strong philosophical underpinnings, and by sound professional standards for practice. Child welfare services must be based on these principles:\n\n(1) Parents have the primary responsibility for and are the primary resource for their children.\n\n(2) Children should have the opportunity to grow up in a family unit if at all possible.\n\n(3) State and community agencies have a responsibility to implement prevention programs aimed at identifying high risk families and to provide supportive intervention to reduce occurrence of maltreatment.\n\n(4) Services for families should be accessible and designed to encourage and enable families to adequately deal with their problems within their own family system.\n\n(5) Child welfare intervention into a family's life should be structured so as to avoid a child's entry into the protective service and foster care systems if at all possible.\n\n(6) The state's child welfare system must be designed to be child-centered, family-focused, community-based, and culturally competent in its prevention and protection efforts.\n\n(7) Neighborhoods and communities are the primary source of opportunities and supports for families and have a primary responsibility in assuring the safety and vitality of their members.\n\n(8) The Department of Social Services shall collaborate with the community to identify, support, and treat families in a nonthreatening manner, in both investigative and family assessment situations.\n\n(9) A family assessment approach, stressing the safety of the child, building on the strengths of the family, and identifying and treating the family's needs is the appropriate approach for cases not requiring law enforcement involvement or the removal of the child.\n\n(10) Only a comparatively small percentage of current child abuse and neglect reports are criminal in nature or will result in the removal of the child or alleged perpetrator.\n\n(11) Should removal of a child become necessary, the state's foster care system must be prepared to provide timely and appropriate placements for children with relatives or in licensed foster care settings and to establish a plan which reflects a commitment by the State to achieving permanency for the child within reasonable timelines.\n\n(12) The Department of Social Services staff who investigates serious child abuse and neglect reports with law enforcement must be competent in law enforcement procedures, fact finding, evidence gathering, and effective social intervention and assessment.\n\n(13) Services should be identified quickly and should build on the strengths and resources of families and communities.\n\n(B) It is the purpose of this chapter to:\n\n(1) acknowledge the different intervention needs of families;\n\n(2) establish an effective system of services throughout the State to safeguard the well-being and development of endangered children and to preserve and stabilize family life, whenever appropriate;\n\n(3) ensure permanency on a timely basis for children when removal from their homes is necessary;\n\n(4) establish fair and equitable procedures, compatible with due process of law to intervene in family life with due regard to the safety and welfare of all family members; and\n\n(5) establish an effective system of protection of children from injury and harm while living in public and private residential agencies and institutions meant to serve them.\n\n(C) All child welfare intervention by the State has as its primary goal the welfare and safety of the child.\n\n(D) Beginning September 1, 2023, the department must provide to the General Assembly an annual report that enumerates each case accepted for investigation in which the department failed to comply with the time frames established in this chapter, the amount of time beyond the time frames established that the department required to complete the proceeding, and the good cause for the department's inability or failure to comply.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2023 Act No. 33 (S.612), Section 1, eff May 16, 2023.",

If an affirmative determination is made by the court after an affirmative determination is made by the Department of Social Services, the court's finding must be the affirmative determination.\n\n(3) \"Age or developmentally appropriate\" means:\n\n(a) activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of maturity or that are determined to be developmentally appropriate for a child, based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities that are typical for an age or age group;\n\n(b) in the case of a specific child, activities or items that are suitable for the child based on the developmental stages attained by the child with respect to the cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities of the child; and\n\n(c) activities that include, but are not be limited to, the following:\n\n(i) sports;\n\n(ii) field trips;\n\n(iii) extracurricular activities;\n\n(iv) social activities;\n\n(v) after school programs or functions;\n\n(vi) vacations with caregiver lasting up to two weeks;\n\n(vii) overnight activities away from caregiver lasting up to one week;\n\n(viii) employment opportunities; and\n\n(ix) in-state or out-of-state travel, excluding overseas travel;\n\n(d) activities that do not conflict with any pending matters before the court, an existing court order, or the child's scheduled appointments for evaluations or treatment.\n\n(4) \"Caregiver\" means a foster parent, kinship foster parent, or employee of a group home who is designated to make decisions regarding age or developmentally appropriate activities or experiences on behalf of a child in the custody of the department.\n\n(5) \"Child\" means a person under the age of eighteen.\n\n(6) \"Child abuse or neglect\" or \"harm\" occurs when:\n\n(a) the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare:\n\n(i) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment, but excluding corporal punishment or physical discipline which:\n\n(A) is administered by a parent or person in loco parentis;\n\n(B) is perpetrated for the sole purpose of restraining or correcting the child;\n\n(C) is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree;\n\n(D) has not brought about permanent or lasting damage to the child; and\n\n(E) is not reckless or grossly negligent behavior by the parents;\n\n(ii) commits or allows to be committed against the child a sexual offense as defined by the laws of this State or engages in acts or omissions that present a substantial risk that a sexual offense as defined in the laws of this State would be committed against the child;\n\n(iii) fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education as required under Article 1 of Chapter 65 of Title 59, supervision appropriate to the child's age and development, or health care though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so and the failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental injury. However, a child's absences from school may not be considered abuse or neglect unless the school has made efforts to bring about the child's attendance, and those efforts were unsuccessful because of the parents' refusal to cooperate. For the purpose of this chapter \"adequate health care\" includes any medical or nonmedical remedial health care permitted or authorized under state law;\n\n(iv) abandons the child;\n\n(v) encourages, condones, or approves the commission of delinquent acts by the child including, but not limited to, sexual trafficking or exploitation, and the commission of the acts are shown to be the result of the encouragement, condonation, or approval;\n\n(vi) commits or allows to be committed against the child female genital mutilation as defined in Section 16-3-2210 or engages in acts or omissions that present a substantial risk that the crime of female genital mutilation would be committed against the child; or\n\n(vii) has committed abuse or neglect as described in subsubitems (i) through (vi) such that a child who subsequently becomes part of the person's household is at substantial risk of one of those forms of abuse or neglect; or\n\n(b) a child is a victim of trafficking in persons as defined in Section 16-3-2010, including sex trafficking, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare. Identifying a child as a victim of trafficking in persons does not create a presumption that the parent, guardian, or other individual responsible for the child's welfare abused, neglected, or harmed the child.\n\n(7) \"Childcare institution\" means a private childcare institution, or a public childcare institution which accommodates no more than twenty-five children, that is licensed by the department. \"Childcare institution\" does not include wilderness camps or training schools, nor does it include any facility that exists primarily for the detention or correction of children.\n\n(8) \"Child protective investigation\" means an inquiry conducted by the department in response to a report of child abuse or neglect made pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(9) \"Child protective services\" means assistance provided by the department as a result of indicated reports or affirmative determinations of child abuse or neglect, including assistance ordered by the family court or consented to by the family. The objectives of child protective services are to:\n\n(a) protect the child's safety and welfare; and\n\n(b) maintain the child within the family unless the safety of the child requires placement outside the home.\n\n(10) \"Court\" means the family court.\n\n(11) \"Department\" means the Department of Social Services.\n\n(12)(a) \"Emergency protective custody\" means the right to physical custody of a child for a temporary period of no more than twenty-four hours to protect the child from imminent danger.\n\n(b) Emergency protective custody may be taken only by a law enforcement officer pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(13) \"Legal Guardianship\" means:\n\n(a) a judicially established relationship between a child and caretaker that is intended to be permanent and self-sustaining and transfers to the caretaker the following parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child:\n\n(i) the duty to provide protection, support, food, clothing, shelter, supervision, education, and care;\n\n(ii) physical custody of the child;\n\n(iii) legal custody when family court has not awarded legal custody to another person, agency, or institution;\n\n(iv) the right to consent to marriage, enlistment in the armed forces, and medical and surgical treatment;\n\n(v) the duty and authority to represent the child in legal actions and to make decisions of substantial legal significance affecting the child;\n\n(vi) the right to determine the nature and extent of the child's contact with other persons; and\n\n(vii) the right to manage the child's income and assets.\n\n(b) Unless the court so orders, legal guardianship does not terminate the parent-child relationship, including the right of the child to inherit from his parent, the parent's right to consent to the child's adoption, and the parent's obligation to provide financial, medical, or other support for the child as the court may order.\n\n(14) \"Indicated report\" means a report of child abuse or neglect supported by facts which warrant a finding by a preponderance of evidence that abuse or neglect is more likely than not to have occurred.\n\n(15) \"Institutional child abuse and neglect\" means situations of known or suspected child abuse or neglect where the person responsible for the child's welfare is the employee of a public or private residential home, institution, or agency.\n\n(16) \"Legal custody\" means the right to the physical custody, care, and control of a child; the right to determine where the child shall live; the right and duty to provide protection, food, clothing, shelter, ordinary medical care, education, supervision, and discipline for a child and in an emergency to authorize surgery or other extraordinary care. The court may in its order place other rights and duties with the legal custodian. Unless otherwise provided by court order, the parent or guardian retains the right to make decisions of substantial legal significance affecting the child, including consent to a marriage, enlistment in the armed forces, and major nonemergency medical and surgical treatment, the obligation to provide financial support or other funds for the care of the child, and other residual rights or obligations as may be provided by order of the court.\n\n(17) \"Mental injury\" means an injury to the intellectual, emotional, or psychological capacity or functioning of a child as evidenced by a discernible and substantial impairment of the child's ability to function when the existence of that impairment is supported by the opinion of a mental health professional or medical professional.\n\n(18) \"Party in interest\" includes the child, the child's attorney and guardian ad litem, the natural parent, an individual with physical or legal custody of the child, the foster parent, and the local foster care review board.\n\n(19) \"Person responsible for a child's welfare\" includes the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, an operator, employee, or caregiver, as defined by Section 63-13-20, of a public or private residential home, institution, agency, or childcare facility or an adult who has assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the child, but who does not necessarily have legal custody of the child. A person whose only role is as a caregiver and whose contact is only incidental with a child, such as a babysitter or a person who has only incidental contact but may not be a caretaker, has not assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian. An investigation pursuant to Section 63-7-920 must be initiated when the information contained in a report otherwise sufficient under this section does not establish whether the person has assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the child.\n\n(20) \"Physical custody\" means the lawful, actual possession and control of a child.\n\n(21) \"Physical injury\" means death or permanent or temporary disfigurement or impairment of any bodily organ or function.\n\n(22) \"Preponderance of evidence\" means evidence which, when fairly considered, is more convincing as to its truth than the evidence in opposition.\n\n(23) \"Probable cause\" means facts and circumstances based upon accurate and reliable information, including hearsay, that would justify a reasonable person to believe that a child subject to a report under this chapter is abused or neglected.\n\n(24) \"Protective services unit\" means the unit established within the Department of Social Services which has prime responsibility for state efforts to strengthen and improve the prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect.\n\n(25) \"Qualified individual\" means a trained professional or licensed clinician.

When using the reasonable and prudent parent standard the caregiver must consider the following:\n\n(1) the best interest of the child based upon information known by the caregiver;\n\n(2) the overall health and safety of the child;\n\n(3) the child's age, maturity, behavioral history, and ability to participate in the proposed activity;\n\n(4) the potential risks and the appropriateness of the proposed activity;\n\n(5) the importance of encouraging the child's emotional and developmental growth; and\n\n(6) any permissions or prohibitions outlined in an existing court order.\n\n(C) Each caregiver shall use reasonable and prudent efforts to immediately notify the department when the caregiver approves any overnight travel out-of-state, whether with the caregiver or away from the caregiver, so that the department is informed as to where the child will be.

      "text": "(A) A safe haven in this State must, without a court order, take temporary physical custody of an infant who is voluntarily left with the safe haven by a person who does not express an intent to return for the infant and the circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that the person does not intend to return for the infant. If the safe haven is a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, the hospital or hospital facility shall perform any act necessary to protect the physical health or safety of the infant; any other safe haven shall, as soon as possible, but no later than six hours after receiving an infant, transport the infant to a hospital or hospital outpatient facility. The person leaving the infant is not required to disclose his or her identity; however, the person must leave the infant in the physical custody of a staff member or employee of the safe haven.\n\n(B)(1) A facility, agency, or other location designated as a safe haven pursuant to subsection (J)(2) must post a notice prepared by the department on its premises that is prominently displayed for view by the public, stating that the facility, agency, or other location is a safe haven at which a person may leave an infant.\n\n(2) The safe haven must offer the person leaving the infant information concerning the legal effect of leaving the infant with the safe haven.\n\n(3) The safe haven must ask the person leaving the infant to identify any parent of the infant other than the person leaving the infant with the safe haven. The safe haven also must attempt to obtain from the person information concerning the infant's background and medical history as specified on a form provided by the department. This information must include, but is not limited to, information concerning the use of a controlled substance by the infant's mother, provided that information regarding the use of a controlled substance by the infant's mother is not admissible as evidence of the unlawful use of a controlled substance in any court proceeding. The safe haven must give the person a copy of the form and a prepaid envelope for mailing the form to the department if the person does not wish to provide the information to the safe haven. The department must provide these materials to safe havens.\n\n(4) Identifying information disclosed by the person leaving the infant must be kept confidential by the safe haven and disclosed to no one other than the department. However, if a court determines that the immunity provisions of subsection (H) do not apply, the safe haven may disclose the information as permitted by confidentiality protections applicable to records of the safe haven, if the safe haven has such confidentiality protections for records. The department must maintain confidentiality of this information in accordance with Section 63-7-1990.\n\n(C) Not later than the close of the first business day after the date on which a hospital or hospital outpatient facility takes possession of an infant pursuant to subsection (A), the hospital or hospital outpatient facility shall notify the department that it has taken temporary physical custody of the infant. The department has legal custody of the infant immediately upon receipt of the notice. The department shall assume physical control of the infant as soon as practicable upon receipt of the notice, but no later than twenty-four hours after receiving notice that the infant is ready for discharge from the hospital or hospital outpatient facility. Assumption of custody by the department pursuant to this subsection does not constitute emergency protective custody, and the provisions of Subarticle 3 of Article 3 do not apply. The department is not required to initiate a child protective services investigation solely because an infant comes into its custody under this subsection.\n\n(D) Immediately after receiving notice from a hospital or hospital outpatient facility pursuant to subsection (C), the department shall contact the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division for assistance in assuring that the infant is not a missing infant. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division shall treat the request as ongoing for a period of thirty days and shall contact the department if a missing infant report is received that might relate to the infant.\n\n(E)(1) Within forty-eight hours after taking legal custody of the infant, the department shall publish notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the safe haven that initially took the infant is located, and send a news release to broadcast and print media in the area. The notice and the news release must state the circumstances under which the infant was left at the safe haven, a description of the infant, and the date, time, and place of the permanency planning and termination of parental rights hearing provided for in subsection (E)(2). The notice and the news release must also state that any person wishing to assert parental rights in regard to the infant must do so at the hearing. If the person leaving the infant identified anyone as being a parent of the infant, the notice must be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the person identified as a parent at least two weeks prior to the hearing.\n\n(2) Within forty-eight hours after obtaining legal custody of the infant, the department shall file a petition for permanency planning alleging that the infant has been abandoned, that the court should dispense with reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family, that continuation of keeping the infant in the home of the parent or parents would be contrary to the welfare of the infant, and that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the infant. The department shall file concurrently with the petition for permanency planning a petition for termination of parental rights pursuant to Section 63-7-2570 based on abandonment and any other applicable grounds. A hearing on both petitions must be held no earlier than thirty and no later than sixty days after the department takes legal custody of the infant. Unless a person wishing to assert parental rights does so at the hearing, this hearing shall serve as the permanency planning hearing and the termination of parental rights hearing for the infant. If the court approves the permanent plan of termination of parental rights and issues an order terminating parental rights to the infant, the order must also provide that the department shall, within thirty days of the close of the hearing, submit a plan to the court and to the infant's guardian ad litem for permanent placement of the infant and otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 63-7-2580(A). If a person asserts parental rights to the infant at the hearing, and the court approves a permanent plan of termination of parental rights and adoption, the court shall schedule a hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights no later than thirty days after the close of the permanency planning hearing.\n\n(F) In any judicial proceeding in which the abuse or neglect of an infant is an issue, the act of voluntarily leaving an infant with a safe haven pursuant to this section is conclusive evidence that the infant has been abused or neglected for purposes of Department of Social Services' jurisdiction and for evidentiary purposes. The act of voluntarily leaving an infant with a safe haven pursuant to this section is also conclusive evidence that the requirements for termination of parental rights have been satisfied as to any parent who left the infant or acted in concert with the person leaving the infant.\n\n(G) A person who leaves an infant at a safe haven or directs another person to do so must not be prosecuted for any criminal offense on account of such action if:\n\n(1) the person is a parent of the infant or is acting at the direction of a parent;\n\n(2) the person leaves the infant in the physical custody of a staff member or an employee of the safe haven; and\n\n(3) the infant is not more than sixty days old or the infant is reasonably determined by the hospital or hospital outpatient facility to be not more than sixty days old.\n\nThis subsection does not apply to prosecution for the infliction of any harm upon the infant other than the harm inherent in abandonment.\n\n(H) A safe haven and its agents, and any health care professionals practicing within a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, are immune from civil or criminal liability for any action authorized by this section, so long as the safe haven, or health care professional, complies with all provisions of this section.\n\n(I) The department, either alone or in collaboration with any other public entity, shall take appropriate measures to achieve public awareness of the provisions of this section.\n\n(J) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"infant\" means a person not more than sixty days old; and\n\n(2) \"safe haven\" means a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, a law enforcement agency, a fire station, an emergency medical services station, or any staffed house of worship during hours when the facility is staffed.\n\n(K) Annually the department shall submit a report to the General Assembly containing data on infants who come into the custody of the department pursuant to this section. The data must include, but are not limited to, the date, time, and place where the infant was left, the hospital to which the infant was taken, the health of the infant at the time of being admitted to the hospital, disposition and placement of the infant, and, if available, circumstances surrounding the infant being left at the safe haven.

Reports must be maintained in the category of suspected for no more than sixty days after the report was received by the department. By the end of the sixty-day time period, suspected reports must be classified as either unfounded or indicated pursuant to the agency's investigation.\n\n(B)(1) Indicated findings must be based upon a finding of the facts available to the department that there is a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child. Indicated findings must include a description of the services being provided the child and those responsible for the child's welfare and all relevant dispositional information.\n\n(2) If the family court makes a determination or the process described in Subarticle 9 results in a determination that the indicated finding is not supported by a preponderance of evidence that there was any act of child abuse or neglect, the case classification must be converted to unfounded and Section 63-7-940 applies.\n\n(3) If the family court makes a specific determination, or the process described in Subarticle 9 results in a determination that there is not a preponderance of evidence that the person who was the subject of the report committed an act of child abuse or neglect, but that the child was abused or neglected by an unknown person, the department must maintain the case as an indicated case and access to records of the case may be granted as provided in Section 63-7-1990.

Unfounded reports must be further classified as Category I, Category II, Category III, or Category IV.\n\n(1) Category I unfounded reports are those in which abuse and neglect were ruled out following the investigation. A report falls in this category if evidence of abuse or neglect as defined in this chapter was not found regardless of whether the family had other problems or was in need of services.\n\n(2) Category II unfounded reports are those in which the investigation did not produce a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child.\n\n(3) Category III unfounded reports are those in which an investigation could not be completed because the department was unable to locate the child or family or for some other compelling reason.\n\n(4) Category IV unfounded reports are records of information received pursuant to Section 63-7-350, but which were not investigated by the department.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.",

The court may consider this issue on the motion of a named party, the child's guardian ad litem, or the foster care review board, provided that the foster care review board has reviewed the case pursuant to Section 63-11-720 or the child has previous entry into foster care.\n\n(C) The family court may authorize the department to terminate or forego reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family when the records of a court of competent jurisdiction show or when the family court determines that one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) the parent has subjected the child or another child while residing in the parent's domicile to one or more of the following aggravated circumstances:\n\n(a) severe or repeated abuse;\n\n(b) severe or repeated neglect;\n\n(c) sexual abuse;\n\n(d) acts the judge finds constitute torture; or\n\n(e) abandonment;\n\n(2) the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to murder of another child, or an equivalent offense, in this jurisdiction or another;\n\n(3) the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to voluntary manslaughter of another child, or an equivalent offense, in this jurisdiction or another;\n\n(4) the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to aiding, abetting, attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of the child or another child while residing in the parent's domicile, or an equivalent offense, in this jurisdiction or another;\n\n(5) physical abuse of a child resulted in the death or admission to the hospital for in-patient care of that child and the abuse is the act for which the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to committing, aiding, abetting, conspiring to commit, or soliciting:\n\n(a) an offense against the person, as provided for in Title 16, Chapter 3;\n\n(b) criminal domestic violence, as defined in Section 16-25-20;\n\n(c) criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature, as defined in Section 16-25-65; or\n\n(d) the common law offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, or an equivalent offense in another jurisdiction;\n\n(6) the parental rights of the parent to another child of the parent have been terminated involuntarily;\n\n(7) the parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unable or unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child;\n\n(8) other circumstances exist that the court finds make continuation or implementation of reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family inconsistent with the permanent plan for the child.\n\n(D) The department may proceed with efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian concurrently with making efforts to prevent removal or to make it possible for the child to return safely to the home.\n\n(E) If the family court's decision that reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family are not required results from a hearing other than a permanency planning hearing, the court's order shall require that a permanency planning hearing be held within thirty days of the date of the order.\n\n(F) In determining whether to authorize the department to terminate or forego reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family, the court must consider whether initiation or continuation of reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family is in the best interests of the child. If the court authorizes the department to terminate or forego reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family, the court must make specific written findings in support of its conclusion that one or more of the conditions set forth in subsection (C)(1) through (8) are shown to exist, and why continuation of reasonable efforts is not in the best interest of the child. If the court does not authorize the department to terminate or forego reasonable efforts where one or more of the conditions set forth in subsection (C)(1) through (8) are shown to exist, the court must make specific written findings in support of its conclusion that continuation of reasonable efforts is in the best interest of the child.

If a noncustodial parent is not named as a party in the removal petition, the agency shall exercise every reasonable effort to promptly notify the noncustodial parent that a removal proceeding has been initiated and of the date and time of any hearings scheduled pursuant to this section.\n\n(B)(1) The petition shall contain a full description of the reasons why the child cannot be protected adequately in the custody of the parent or guardian, including facts supporting the department's allegation that the child is an abused or neglected child as defined in Section 63-7-20 and that retention of the child in or return of the child to the home would place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting the child's life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being and the child cannot reasonably be protected from this harm without being removed, a description of the condition of the child, any previous efforts to work with the parent or guardian, in-home treatment programs which have been offered and proven inadequate, and the attitude of the parent or guardian towards placement of the child in an alternative setting. The petition also shall contain a statement of the harms the child is likely to suffer as a result of removal and a description of the steps that will be taken to minimize the harm to the child that may result upon removal.\n\n(2) The petition for removal may include a petition for termination of parental rights. The petition for removal must include a petition for termination of parental rights if court records or other evidence indicate the existence of one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 63-7-1640(C)(1) through (8), unless there are compelling reasons for believing that termination of parental rights would be contrary to the best interests of the child.\n\n(C)(1) Whether or not the petition for removal includes a petition for termination of parental rights, the petition shall contain a notice informing the parents of the potential effect of the hearing on their parental rights and a notice to all interested parties that objections to the sufficiency of a placement plan, if ordered, or of any recommendations for provisions in the plan or court order must be raised at the hearing.

If you fail to comply with the plan, you could lose your rights as a parent\".\n\n(D) Upon receipt of a removal petition under this section, the family court shall schedule a hearing to be held within thirty-five days of the date of receipt to determine whether removal is necessary. The parties to the petition must be served with a summons and notices of right to counsel and the hearing date and time along with the petition.

The court may authorize service by publication in appropriate cases and may waive the thirty-five days requirement when necessary to achieve service.

The father or the other adult must be made a party to the action and subject to the court's order establishing the conditions for maintaining the child in the mother's home. This statutory presumption does not preclude the court from ordering removal of a child upon other proof of alcohol or drug abuse or addiction by the parent or person responsible for the child who has harmed the child or threatened the child with harm.\n\n(G) If the court removes custody of the child, the court's order shall contain a finding by the court of whether reasonable efforts were made by the department to prevent removal of the child and a finding of whether continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child. The order shall state:\n\n(1) the services made available to the family before the removal of the child and how they related to the needs of the family;\n\n(2) the efforts of the agency to provide these services to the family before removal;\n\n(3) why the efforts to provide services did not eliminate the need for removal; and\n\n(4) whether the efforts to eliminate the need for removal were reasonable including, but not limited to, whether they were reasonably available and timely, reasonably adequate to address the needs of the family, reasonably adequate to protect the child and realistic under the circumstances. If the department's first contact with the child occurred under such circumstances that reasonable services would not have allowed the child to remain safely in the home, the court shall find that removal of the child without services or without further services was reasonable.\n\n(H)(1) If the court removes custody of the child and there is a pending petition for termination of parental rights filed by the department, the department shall promptly exercise and document every reasonable effort to promote and expedite an adoptive placement and the adoption of the child, and the department must not delay adoption planning because of a pending termination of parental rights action or because of an upcoming permanency planning hearing.\n\n(2) If at any time after the court removes custody of the child and the department files a petition for termination of parental rights, then the department promptly shall exercise and document every reasonable effort to promote and expedite an adoptive placement and the adoption of the child prior to any permanency planning or termination of parental rights hearing, and the department must not delay adoption planning because of a pending termination of parental rights action or because of an upcoming permanency planning hearing.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2010 Act No. 160, Section 2, eff May 12, 2010; 2023 Act No. 80 (H.3553), Section 5, eff June 19, 2023.",

The placement must be as close to the child's home as is reasonably possible, unless there are compelling reasons for concluding that placement at a greater distance is necessary to promote the child's well-being. In the absence of good cause to the contrary, preference must be given to placement with a relative or other person who is known to the child and who has a constructive and caring relationship with the child;\n\n(2) visitation or other contact with siblings, other relatives, and other persons important to the child. The plan shall provide for as much contact between the child and these persons as is reasonably possible and consistent with the best interests of the child;\n\n(3) social and other supportive services to be provided to the child and the foster parents, including counseling or other services to assist the child in dealing with the effects of separation from the child's home and family; and\n\n(4) the minimum number and frequency of contacts that a caseworker with the department will have with the child, which must be based on the particular needs and circumstances of the individual child but which must not be less than once a month for a child placed in this State.\n\n(F) The court shall approve the plan only if it finds that:\n\n(1) the plan is consistent with the court's order placing the child in the custody of the department;\n\n(2) the plan is consistent with the requirements for the content of a placement plan set forth in subsections (B) through (E);\n\n(3) if the parents or guardian of the child did not participate in the development of the plan, that the department made reasonable efforts to secure their participation; and\n\n(4) the plan is meaningful and designed to address facts and circumstances upon which the court based the order of removal.\n\nIf the court determines that any of these criteria are not satisfied, the court shall require that necessary amendments to the plan be submitted to the court within a specified time but no later than seven days. A hearing on the amended plan must be held if requested by a party.\n\n(G) The court shall include in its order and shall advise defendants on the record that failure to remedy the conditions that caused the removal within six months, may result in termination of parental rights, subject to notice and a hearing as provided in Article 7. Before the court orders return of the child, the court must find that the changes in the home and family situation specified in section one of the plan have occurred and that the child can be safely returned to the home. Completion of the tasks specified in section two of the plan is not in itself sufficient basis for return of the child.\n\n(H) The department immediately shall give a copy of the plan to the parents or guardian of the child, and any other parties identified by the court, including the child if the court considers it appropriate. If a copy of the plan is not given to the child, the department shall provide the child with age-appropriate information concerning the substance of the plan unless the court finds that disclosure of any part of the plan to the child would be inconsistent with the child's best interests. A copy of any part of the plan that directly pertains to the foster family or the foster child must be provided to the foster parents.\n\n(I) The plan may be amended at any time if all parties agree to the revisions, and the revisions are approved by the court. The amended plan must be submitted to the court with a written explanation for the proposed change. The plan also may be amended by the court upon motion of a party after a hearing based on evidence demonstrating the need for the amendment. A copy of the amended plan immediately must be given to the parties specified in subsection (H).\n\n(J) Any objections to the sufficiency of a plan or the process by which a plan was developed must be made at the hearing on the plan. Failure to request a hearing or to enter an objection at the hearing constitutes a waiver of the objection. The sufficiency of the plan or of the process for developing the plan may not be raised as an issue in a proceeding for termination of parental rights under Article 7.\n\n(K) Upon petition of a party in interest, the court may order the state or county director or other authorized representative of the department to show cause why the agency should not be required to provide services in accordance with the plan.

If the court approves a plan of another planned permanent living arrangement (APPLA), the court must find compelling reasons for approval of the plan, including compelling reasons why reunification with the parents, custody, or guardianship with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental rights and adoption is not in the best interest, and that the plan is and continues to be in the child's best interest. The court shall not approve or order APPLA pursuant to this item for children under the age of sixteen. At each hearing in which the court approves or renews APPLA for a child over the age of sixteen, the court must ask the child about the child's wishes as to the placement plan.\n\n(3) In addition to the requirements in items (1) and (2), at each permanency planning hearing, the court shall review the department's efforts to facilitate the caregiver's compliance with the reasonable and prudent parent standard pursuant to Section 63-7-20 and Section 63-7-25 and the department's efforts to determine whether the child has regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities.\n\n(4) Upon motion of any party or at the discretion of the court, a pending termination of parental rights action may be consolidated with a contested permanency planning hearing.\n\n(D) If the court determines at the permanency planning hearing that the child may be safely maintained in the home in that the parent has remedied the conditions that caused the removal and the return of the child to the child's parent would not cause an unreasonable risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, safety, or mental well-being, the court shall order the child returned to the child's parent. The court may order a specified period of supervision and services not to exceed twelve months. When determining whether the child should be returned, the court shall consider all evidence; if the removal of the child from the family was due to drug use by one or both parents, then a drug test must be administered to the parent or both parents, as appropriate, and the results must be considered with all other evidence in determining whether the child should be returned to the parents' care; and the supplemental report including whether the parent has substantially complied with the terms and conditions of the plan approved pursuant to Section 63-7-1680.\n\n(E) Unless subsection (C), (F), or (G) applies, if the court determines at the permanency planning hearing that the child should not be returned to the child's parent at that time, the court's order shall require the department to file a petition to terminate parental rights to the child not later than sixty days after receipt of the order. If a petition to terminate parental rights is to be filed, the department shall exercise and document every reasonable effort to promote and expedite the adoptive placement and adoption of the child, including a thorough adoption assessment and child-specific recruitment. Adoptive placements must be diligently sought for the child and failure to do so solely because a child is classified as \"special needs\" is expressly prohibited. An adoption may not be delayed or denied solely because a child is classified as \"special needs\". For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) \"thorough adoption assessment\" means conducting and documenting face-to-face interviews with the child, foster care providers, and other significant parties; and\n\n(2) \"child specific recruitment\" means recruiting an adoptive placement targeted to meet the individual needs of the specific child including, but not be limited to, use of the media, use of photo listings, and any other in-state or out-of-state resources which may be utilized to meet the specific needs of the child, unless there are extenuating circumstances that indicate that these efforts are not in the best interest of the child.\n\n(F) If the court determines that the criteria in subsection (D) are not met but that the child may be returned to the parent within a specified reasonable time not to exceed eighteen months after the child was placed in foster care, the court may order an extension of the plan approved pursuant to Section 63-7-1680 or may order compliance with a modified plan, but in no case may the extension for reunification continue beyond eighteen months after the child was placed in foster care. An extension may be granted pursuant to this section only if the court finds:\n\n(1) that the parent has demonstrated due diligence and a commitment to correcting the conditions warranting the removal so that the child could return home in a timely fashion;\n\n(2) that there are specific reasons to believe that the conditions warranting the removal will be remedied by the end of the extension;\n\n(3) that the return of the child to the child's parent would not cause an unreasonable risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, safety, or mental well-being;\n\n(4) that, at the time of the hearing, initiation of termination of parental rights is not in the best interest of the child; and\n\n(5) that the best interests of the child will be served by the extended or modified plan.\n\n(G)(1) If after assessing the viability of adoption, the department demonstrates that termination of parental rights is not in the child's best interests, the court may award custody or legal guardianship, or both, to a suitable, fit, and willing relative, nonrelative, or fictive kin if the court finds this to be in the best interest of the child; however, a home study on the individual whom the department is recommending for custody or legal guardianship of the child must be submitted to the court for consideration before custody or legal guardianship, or both, are awarded. If the child's plan is legal guardianship with a relative or fictive kin with supplemental benefits, the requirements of Section 63-7-1705 and Article 9 must be met. The supplemental report and child's case plan must address:\n\n(a) how the child meets the eligibility requirements for legal guardianship with supplemental benefits;\n\n(b) the steps the department has taken to determine that the child's return home and termination of parental rights and adoption are not appropriate;\n\n(c) the department's efforts to discuss adoption with the relative or fictive kin, and the reasons why adoption is not an option;\n\n(d) the department's efforts to discuss legal guardianship with supplemental benefits with the child's parents or reason why efforts were not made;\n\n(e) the reason why legal guardianship and receipt of supplemental benefits is in the child's best interests;\n\n(f) if the child's placement with the relative or fictive kin does not include siblings, the reason why the child is separated from siblings during placement;\n\n(g) if the child is fourteen years or older, that the child has been consulted regarding the legal guardianship arrangement; and\n\n(h) that the relative or fictive kin meets all requirements for licensure as a kinship foster parent.\n\n(2) The court may order a specified period of supervision and services not to exceed twelve months, and the court may authorize a period of visitation or trial placement prior to receiving a home study.\n\n(H) If at the initial permanency planning hearing the court does not order return of the child pursuant to subsection (D), in addition to those findings supporting the selection of a different plan, the court shall specify in its order:\n\n(1) what services have been provided to or offered to the parents to facilitate reunification;\n\n(2) the compliance or lack of compliance by all parties to the plan approved pursuant to Section 63-7-1680;\n\n(3) the extent to which the parents have visited or supported the child and any reasons why visitation or support has not occurred or has been infrequent;\n\n(4) whether previous services should continue and whether additional services are needed to facilitate reunification, identifying the services, and specifying the expected date for completion, which must be no longer than eighteen months from the date the child was placed in foster care;\n\n(5) whether return of the child can be expected and identification of the changes the parent must make in circumstances, conditions, or behavior to remedy the causes of the child's placement or retention in foster care;\n\n(6) whether the child's foster care is to continue for a specified time and, if so, how long;\n\n(7) if the child has attained the age of sixteen, the services needed to assist the child to make the transition to independent living;\n\n(8) whether the child has provided written authorization to remain in foster care after the child's eighteenth birthday and whether the court finds that it would be in the child's best interests to remain in foster care after the child's eighteenth birthday for a period not to exceed the child's twenty-first birthday pursuant to Article 8;\n\n(9) whether the child's current placement is safe and appropriate;\n\n(10) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parents in remedying the causes of the child's placement or retention in foster care, unless the court has previously authorized the department to terminate or forego reasonable efforts pursuant to Section 63-7-1640; and\n\n(11) the steps the department is taking to promote and expedite the adoptive placement and to finalize the adoption of the child, including documentation of child specific recruitment efforts.\n\n(I) If after the permanency planning hearing, the child is retained in foster care, future permanency planning hearings must be held as follows:\n\n(1) If the child is retained in foster care and the agency is required to initiate termination of parental rights proceedings, the termination of parental rights hearing may serve as the next permanency planning hearing, but only if it is held no later than one year from the date of the previous permanency planning hearing.\n\n(2) If the court ordered extended foster care for the purpose of reunification with the parent, the court must select a permanent plan for the child other than another extension for reunification purposes at the next permanency planning hearing. The hearing must be held on or before the date specified in the plan for expected completion of the plan; in no case may the hearing be held any later than six months from the date of the last court order.\n\n(3) After the termination of parental rights hearing, the requirements of Section 63-7-2580 must be met. Permanency planning hearings must be held annually, starting with the date of the termination of parental rights hearing. No further permanency planning hearings may be required after filing a decree of adoption of the child or an order establishing legal guardianship.\n\n(4) If the court places custody or guardianship with the parent, extended family member, or suitable nonrelative and a period of services and supervision is authorized, services and supervision automatically terminate on the date specified in the court order. Before the termination date, the department or the guardian ad litem may file a petition with the court for a review hearing on the status of the placement. Filing of the petition stays termination of the case until further order from the court. If the court finds clear and convincing evidence that the child will be threatened with harm if services and supervision do not continue, the court may extend the period of services and supervision for a specified time. The court's order must specify the services and supervision necessary to reduce or eliminate the risk of harm to the child.\n\n(5) If the child is retained in foster care pursuant to a plan other than one described in items (1) through (4), future permanency planning hearings must be held at least annually.\n\n(J) A named party, the child's guardian ad litem, or the local foster care review board may file a motion for review of the case at any time. Any other party in interest may move to intervene in the case pursuant to the rules of civil procedure and if the motion is granted, may move for review. Parties in interest include, but are not limited to, the individual or agency with legal custody or placement of the child and the foster parent. The notice of motion and motion for review must be served on the named parties at least ten days before the hearing date. The motion must state the reason for review of the case and the relief requested.\n\n(K) The pendency of an appeal concerning a child in foster care does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear a case pursuant to this section. The court shall retain jurisdiction to review the status of the child and may act on matters not affected by the appeal.\n\n(L) In the case of a child who remains in a qualified residential treatment program, the court in its order shall address the evidence presented pursuant to subsection (B)(7) and shall state whether the court approves or disapproves the placement in a qualified residential treatment program.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2010 Act No. 160, Section 4, eff May 12, 2010; 2014 Act No. 281 (H.3102), Section 9, eff June 10, 2014; 2016 Act No. 238 (H.4546), Section 3, eff June 5, 2016; 2021 Act No. 24 (H.3567), Sections 5.A, 5.B, eff April 26, 2021; 2022 Act No. 143 (H.3509), Sections 2.A, 2.B, eff April 25, 2022 and upon contingency; 2023 Act No. 25 (S.380), Sections 3, 4, eff May 16, 2023; 2023 Act No. 80 (H.3553), Section 9, eff June 19, 2023.",

Nothing in this section prevents the department from using other information in department records when making decisions concerning licensing, employment, or placement, or performing other duties required by this act. The department also is authorized to consult any department records in providing information to persons conducting preplacement investigations of prospective adoptive parents in accordance with Section 63-9-520.\n\n(J) The department is authorized to maintain in its childcare regulatory records information about investigations of suspected child abuse or neglect occurring in childcare facilities.\n\n(1) The department must enter child abuse or neglect investigation information in its regulatory record from the beginning of the investigation and must add updated information as it becomes available.

In determining whether to allow a child in foster care to participate in an activity, a caregiver must exercise the reasonable and prudent parent standard pursuant to Section 63-7-20 and Section 63-7-25;\n\n(2) adhere strictly to the prescribed number of personal contacts, pursuant to Section 63-7-1680(B)(3).

These visits may be conducted in the foster home and in the presence of other persons who reside in the foster home; however, if the caseworker suspects that the child has been abused or neglected during the placement with the foster parent, the caseworker must observe and interview the child outside the presence of other persons who reside in the foster home;\n\n(3) ensure that a caseworker interviews the foster parent, either in person or by telephone, at least once each month. No less frequently than once every two months, ensure that a caseworker or member of the casework team interviews the foster parent face-to-face during a visit in the foster home;\n\n(4) ensure that a caseworker interviews other adults residing in the foster home, as defined in Section 63-1-40, face-to-face at least once each quarter. A foster parent must notify the department if another adult moves into the home, and the caseworker must interview the adult face-to-face within one month after receiving notice. Interviews of foster parents pursuant to item (3) and of other adults residing in the home pursuant to this item may be conducted together or separately at the discretion of the department;\n\n(5) ensure that its staff visit in the foster home and interview the foster parent or other adults in the home more frequently when conditions in the home, circumstances of the foster children, or other reasons defined in policy and procedure suggest that increased oversight or casework support is appropriate. When more than one caseworker is responsible for a child in the foster home, the department may assign one caseworker to conduct the required face-to-face interview with the other adults residing in the foster home;\n\n(6) provide to the foster child, if age appropriate, a printed card containing a telephone number the child may use to contact a designated unit or individual within the Department of Social Services and further provide an explanation to the child that the number is to be used if problems occur which the child believes his or her caseworker cannot or will not resolve;\n\n(7) provide to the foster child, if age appropriate, a document describing the rights of the child regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, and the right to stay safe and avoid exploitation and obtain a signed acknowledgement from the child upon receipt of the document;\n\n(8) strongly encourage by letter of invitation, provided at least three weeks in advance, the attendance of foster parents to all Foster Care Review Board proceedings held for children in their care. If the foster parents are unable to attend the proceedings, they must submit a progress report to the Foster Care Review Board, at least three days prior to the proceeding. Failure of a foster parent to attend the Foster Care Review Board proceeding or failure to submit a progress report to the Foster Care Review Board does not require the board to delay the proceeding. The letter of invitation and the progress report form must be supplied by the agency;\n\n(9) be placed under the full authority of sanctions and enforcement by the family court pursuant to Section 63-3-530(30) and Section 63-3-530(36) for failure to adhere to the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(B) If the department places a child in foster care in a county which does not have jurisdiction of the case, the department may designate a caseworker in the county of placement to make the visits required by subsection (A).\n\n(C) In fulfilling the requirements of subsection (A), the Department of Social Services shall reasonably perform its tasks in a manner which is least intrusive and disruptive to the lives of the foster children and their foster families.\n\n(D) The Department of Social Services, in executing its duties under subsection (A)(5), must provide a toll free telephone number which must operate twenty-four hours a day.\n\n(E) Any public employee in this State who has actual knowledge that a person has violated any of the provisions of subsection (A) must report those violations to the state office of the Department of Social Services; however, the Foster Care Review Board must report violations of subsection (A)(5) in their regular submissions of advisory decisions and recommendations which are submitted to the family court and the department. Any employee who knowingly fails to report a violation of subsection (A) is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(F) Foster parents have a duty to make themselves reasonably available for the interviews required by subsection (A)(3) and to take reasonable steps to facilitate caseworkers' interviews with other adults who reside in the home as required by subsection (A)(4). Failure to comply with either the duties in this subsection or those in subsection (A)(4) constitutes grounds for revocation of a foster parent's license or other form of approval to provide care to children in the custody of the department. Revocation would depend on the number of instances of noncompliance, the foster parents' wilfulness in noncompliance, or other circumstances indicating that noncompliance by the foster parents significantly and unreasonably interferes with the department's ability to carry out its protective functions under this section.\n\n(G) The department shall adopt and implement any policies consistent with this section that are necessary to promote a caregiver's ability to make decisions described by subsection (A)(1). The department shall make efforts to identify and review any department policy or procedure that may impede a caregiver's ability to make such decisions.\n\n(H) The department shall incorporate into its training for caregivers, as defined in Section 63-7-20(4), and agency personnel the importance of a child's participation in age or developmentally appropriate activities, the benefits of such activities to a child's well-being, and decision-making under the reasonable and prudent parent standard pursuant to Section 63-7-20 and Section 63-7-25.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2016 Act No. 238 (H.4546), Section 4, eff June 5, 2016.",

If the department determines that it is in the best interest of a child requiring out-of-home placement that the child be placed with a relative or fictive kin for foster care, or if a relative or fictive kin advises the department that the relative or fictive kin is interested in providing placement for a child requiring foster care, and the relative or fictive kin is not already licensed to provide foster care, the department shall inform the relative or fictive kin of the procedures for being licensed as a kinship foster parent, assist the foster parent with the licensing process, and inform the relative or fictive kin of availability of payments and other services to kinship foster parents. If the relative or fictive kin is licensed by the department to provide kinship foster care services, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the department regarding kinship foster care, and a placement with the relative or fictive kin is made, the relative or fictive kin may receive payment for the full foster care rate for the care of the child and any other benefits that might be available to foster parents, whether in money or in services.\n\n(D) The department shall establish, in accordance with this section and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, eligibility standards for becoming a kinship foster parent.\n\n(1) A person may be eligible for licensure as a kinship foster parent if he is:\n\n(a) a relative within the first, second, or third degree to the parent or stepparent of a child who may be related through blood, marriage, or adoption; or\n\n(b) a person who has been identified by the department as fictive kin.\n\n(2) The kinship foster parent must be twenty-one years of age or older, except that if the spouse or partner of the relative or fictive kin is twenty-one years of age or older and living in the home, and the relative or fictive kin is between eighteen and twenty-one years of age, the department may waive the age requirement.\n\n(3)(a) A person may become a kinship foster parent only upon the completion of a full kinship foster care licensing study performed in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Residents of the household who are eighteen years of age or older must undergo the state and federal fingerprint review procedures as provided for in Section 63-7-2340. The department shall apply the screening criteria in Section 63-7-2350 to the results of the fingerprint reviews and the licensing study.\n\n(b) The department shall maintain the confidentiality of the results of fingerprint reviews as provided for in state and federal regulations.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the requirement that a relative or fictive kin licensed as a kinship foster parent must be licensed in accordance with the same requirements as nonrelative applicants, the department may waive, on a case-by-case basis, for relative or fictive kin applicants nonsafety elements as the department deems appropriate. Safety elements, such as criminal and child abuse and neglect background checks required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 671(a)(20)(A), may not be waived. The department may not license a relative or fictive kin as a kinship foster parent or place the child with the relative or fictive kin if the placement would violate any provision of Section 63-7-2350. The department shall note on the standard license if there was a waiver of a nonsafety element and identify the element being waived.\n\n(5) The department shall determine, after a thorough review of information obtained in the kinship foster care licensing process, whether the person is able to care effectively for the foster child. The review must take into consideration the parental preference and the preference for placement with a relative or fictive kin who is known to the child and who has a constructive and caring relationship with the child, as provided in Section 63-7-1680(E)(1). The review also must take into consideration the preference for the placement with a relative or fictive kin who, but for the removal of the child at birth, would have had a constructive and caring relationship with the child, based on the relative's or fictive kin's fitness and ability to care for the child.\n\n(E)(1) The department shall involve the kinship foster parents in development of the child's permanent plan pursuant to Section 63-7-1700 and other plans for services to the child and the kinship foster home. The department shall give notice of proceedings and information to the kinship foster parent as provided for elsewhere in this chapter for other foster parents. If planning for the child includes the use of childcare, the department shall pay for childcare arrangements, according to established criteria for payment of these services for foster children. If the permanent plan for the child involves requesting the court to grant custody or guardianship of the child to the kinship foster parent, the department must ensure that it has informed the kinship foster parent about adoption, including services and financial benefits that might be available.\n\n(2) The kinship foster parent shall cooperate with any activities specified in the case plan for the foster child, such as counseling, therapy or court sessions, or visits with the foster child's parents or other family members. Kinship foster parents and placements made in kinship foster care homes are subject to the requirements of Section 63-7-2310.\n\n(F)(1) If a relative or fictive kin is not licensed as a kinship foster parent, then the department may still place the child with the relative or fictive kin notwithstanding the licensure requirement contained in this section if:\n\n(a) the relative or fictive kin begins the kinship foster parent licensure process within a reasonable time after the placement of the child; and\n\n(b)(i) the child has been removed from his home and is in the care, custody, or guardianship of the department, as provided in subsection (C), and the department determines that it is in the best interest of the child to be placed with a relative or fictive kin for foster care; or\n\n(ii) a relative or fictive kin advises the department that the relative or fictive kin is interested in providing placement for the child requiring foster care.\n\n(2) During the licensure process, a relative or fictive kin with whom a child has been placed pursuant to item (1) and who has begun the kinship licensure process shall have the same legal status and access to services as a licensed kinship foster care provider including, but not limited to, the availability of payments and other services.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2018 Act No. 146 (H.3701), Section 3, eff April 4, 2018; 2022 Act No. 168 (S.222), Section 1, eff May 16, 2022.",

      "text": "The family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child:\n\n(1) The child or another child while residing in the parent's domicile has been harmed as defined in Section 63-7-20, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months. In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent's previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child may be considered.\n\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to subarticle 3 or Section 63-7-1660 and has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.\n\n(3) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to visit the child. The court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order. The distance of the child's placement from the parent's home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to visit.\n\n(4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child. Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child's care. A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parent's means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parent's means. The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\n\n(5) The presumptive legal father is not the biological father of the child, and the welfare of the child can best be served by termination of the parental rights of the presumptive legal father.\n\n(6)(a) The following circumstances exist, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 63-21-20:\n\n(i) the parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, addiction to alcohol or illegal drugs or prescription medication abuse; and\n\n(ii) the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child.\n\n(b) It is presumed that the parent's condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time upon proof that the parent has been required by the department or the family court to participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug addiction, and the parent has failed two or more times to complete the program successfully or has refused at two or more separate meetings with the department to participate in a treatment program.\n\n(c) The department, and any other covered entity, must not terminate the rights of a parent or legal guardian with a disability solely on the basis of the disability.\n\n(7) The child has been abandoned as defined in Section 63-7-20.\n\n(8) The child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\n\n(9) The physical abuse of a child of the parent resulted in the death or admission to the hospital for in-patient care of that child and the abuse is the act for which the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to committing, aiding, abetting, conspiring to commit, or soliciting an offense against the person as provided for in Chapter 3, Title 16, criminal domestic violence as defined in Section 16-25-20, criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature as defined in Section 16-25-65, or an assault and battery offense as provided in Article 7, Chapter 3, Title 16.\n\n(10) A parent of the child pleads guilty or nolo contendere to or is convicted of the murder of the child's other parent.\n\n(11) Conception of a child as a result of the criminal sexual conduct of a biological parent, as found by a court of competent jurisdiction, is grounds for terminating the rights of that biological parent, unless the sentencing court makes specific findings on the record that the conviction resulted from consensual sexual conduct when neither the victim nor the actor were younger than fourteen years of age nor older than eighteen years of age at the time of the offense.\n\n(12) The parent of the child pleads guilty or nolo contendere to or is convicted of murder, voluntary manslaughter, or homicide by child abuse, of another child of the parent.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2010 Act No. 160, Sections 5, 6, 7, eff May 12, 2010; 2014 Act No. 281 (H.3102), Section 8, eff June 10, 2014; 2017 Act No. 36 (H.3538), Section 5, eff May 10, 2017.",

Within an additional sixty days the agency shall submit a report to the court and to the guardian ad litem on the implementation of the plan.

The court's order must be sufficient to continue jurisdiction over the parties without any need for filing or service of pleadings by the department. The permanency hearing must be held before the termination of parental rights trial if reasonably possible.\n\n(2) At the hearing, the department shall present a proposed disposition and permanent plan in accordance with Section 63-7-1700. No supplemental report may be required. The hearing and any order issuing from the hearing shall conform to Section 63-7-1700.\n\n(3) If the court approves retention of the child in foster care pursuant to Section 63-7-1700(E), any new plan for services and placement of the child must conform to the requirements of Section 63-7-1680.
