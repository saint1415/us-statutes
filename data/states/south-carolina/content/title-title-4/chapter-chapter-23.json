      "text": "(A) The Pelham-Batesville Fire District (district) was established by the South Carolina General Assembly pursuant to the provisions of Act 554 of 1971, as amended (act). The implementation of the act was contingent upon the results of a referendum to create the district. Thereafter, a referendum was held on September 14, 1971, which resulted favorably to the creation of the district. The district serves portions of Greenville County and Spartanburg County for the purpose of providing fire protection services. Since its creation, the area of the district has grown both industrially and commercially and now includes numerous manufacturing facilities as well as corporate headquarters of national and international companies along and beyond the corridor of I-85 between the cities of Greenville and Spartanburg.\n\nIn order to adequately serve the residents, commercial establishments and industrial facilities, the board of fire control, the governing body of the district (fire board) has determined that certain capital improvements must be undertaken as provided in subsection (B) (improvements). Due to the fact that the district is not a governmental entity with its boundaries located in only one county but is a fully integrated political unit located both in Greenville and Spartanburg counties, neither the County Council of Greenville County nor the County Council of Spartanburg has the individual authority to authorize the fire board to issue general obligation bonds. Thus, because of its regional nature, the fire board has determined to ask the General Assembly to authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds of the district in a specific amount for specific purposes.\n\n(B) The district is hereby authorized to issue general obligation bonds (bonds) in the principal amount of $6,500,000 in a single series or multiple series, in accordance with the remaining subsections of this section. The proceeds shall be used to defray the costs of the improvements to include, as follows:\n\n(1) the development, construction, and outfitting of an approximately 26,000 square foot headquarters and fire station building of the district, to include public access areas for meeting facilities, training, and community events; office and administrative areas; crew quarters; apparatus bays and apparatus and facility support areas; and furniture, fixtures, and equipment, the plan of which shall provide sufficient space, facilities, and equipment to satisfy the current and projected future needs of the district as necessary to ensure the district is capable of meeting the standards of modern fire and rescue facilities; and\n\n(2) the costs of issuance of the bonds.\n\n(C) A public hearing or hearings shall be held upon the question of the issuance of the bonds of the district by the governing bodies of both Spartanburg and Greenville counties at such time and place as they may prescribe. In the event public hearings are held under the provisions of Article 5, Chapter 11, Title 6 of the 1976 Code, as amended, such hearings shall meet the requirements to hold the public hearings provided for herein.\n\n(D) A notice of each public hearing shall be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper or newspapers, as necessary, of general circulation in Greenville County and in Spartanburg County. Such notice shall state:\n\n(1) the time and date of each such public hearing, which shall be not less than sixteen days following the first publication of the notice;\n\n(2) the place of each such public hearing;\n\n(3) the proposed principal amount of bonds to be issued by the district;\n\n(4) a statement setting forth the purpose for which the proceeds of such bonds are to be expended; and\n\n(5) a brief summary of the reasons for the issuance of such bonds and the method by which the principal and interest of such bonds are to be paid.\n\n(E) Such public hearing or hearings shall be conducted publicly and both proponents and opponents of the issuance of the bonds shall be given full opportunity to be heard.\n\n(F) Following the holding of the public hearing or hearings by the governing bodies of Greenville County and Spartanburg County, the fire board shall hold a public hearing in order to discuss the use of the proceeds of the bonds, the estimated annual principal and interest requirements for the proposed bonds and the method by which the bonds will be paid. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once not less than sixteen days prior to the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in Greenville County and in a newspaper of general circulation in Spartanburg County and except for requiring only one notice to be published, shall state the same particulars as required by the notice published pursuant to subsection (D). Subsequent to this public hearing, the fire board, by public vote, shall determine whether the bonds are to be issued. If the bonds are to be issued, the fire board shall determine by resolution the manner in which the bonds shall be issued, all in accordance with the remaining subsections of this section.\n\n(G) All bonds issued pursuant to this section shall mature in such annual series or installments as the fire board shall prescribe, except that the first maturing bonds shall mature not later than five years from the date of their original issuance. No bond shall mature later than forty years from the date of its original issuance.\n\nThe bonds shall be dated as of the date of delivery and shall bear interest from their dated date. The resolution of the fire board approving the bonds (resolution) shall state: (1) whether the bonds will be issued in fully registered form registered in the name of the purchaser thereof or under a book-entry only system in accordance with the provisions of subsection (R); (2) the denomination of the bonds, and the interest payment dates of the bonds; (3) whether to award the bonds on a net interest cost or true interest cost basis; (4) whether, and in what manner, the bonds may be subject to optional and/or mandatory sinking fund redemption; and (5) such other matters regarding the bonds as are necessary, desirable, or appropriate to effect the issuance thereof.\n\n(H) Subsequent to the adoption of the resolution, a notice of such adoption shall be published in a newspaper or newspapers, as necessary, of general circulation in Greenville County and in Spartanburg County. The resolution and the validity of the bonds authorized thereby shall not be open to question except by a suit or other proceeding instituted within twenty (20) days from the date of the publication.\n\n(I) Subject to the last sentence of this subsection, as long as any of the bonds remain outstanding, there shall be a registrar and paying agent, each of which shall be a financial institution maintaining corporate trust offices where: (1) the bonds may be presented for registration of transfers and exchanges, (2) notices and demands to or upon the district in respect of the bonds may be served, and (3) the bonds may be presented for payment, exchange, and transfer. Initially, such financial institution designated by the fire board shall act as both registrar and paying agent. In the event the bonds are issued in physical form payable to the successful bidder at the sale of the bonds, the Treasurer of Greenville County shall serve as registrar and paying agent for the bonds.\n\n(J) Any bonds issued pursuant to this section may be issued with a provision for their redemption prior to their maturity at par and accrued interest, plus such redemption premium as may be prescribed by the fire board, but no bond shall be redeemable before maturity unless it contains a statement to that effect. In the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, provisions shall be made specifying the manner of redemption and the notice thereof that must be given.\n\n(K) The bonds shall be payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.\n\n(L) The bonds issued pursuant to this section shall bear interest at a rate or rates determined by the fire board.\n\n(M)(1) The bonds shall be executed in the name and on behalf of the district by the manual or facsimile signature of the chairman of the fire board, with its official seal impressed, imprinted, or otherwise reproduced thereon, and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of the secretary of the fire board. The bonds may bear the signature of any person who shall have been such an officer authorized to sign the bond at the time such bond was so executed, and shall bind the district notwithstanding the fact that his or her authorization may have ceased prior to the authentication and delivery of the bond.\n\n(2) Each bond shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose nor shall it be entitled to any right or benefit hereunder unless there shall be endorsed on the bond a certificate of authentication in the form set forth in the resolution, duly executed by the manual signature of the registrar, and such certificate of authentication upon any bond executed on behalf of the district shall be conclusive evidence that the bond so authenticated has been duly issued hereunder and that the holder thereof is entitled to the benefit of the terms and provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds.\n\n(N) The bonds shall be sold at public sale, after advertisement of a notice of sale, which may be in summary form, in The State Newspaper or in a financial publication published in the City of New York. The advertisement must appear not less than seven days prior to the date set for the sale. The advertisement may set as a sale date a fixed date not less than seven days following publication, or the advertisement may advise that the sale date will be at least seven days following the date of publication. If a fixed date of sale is not set forth in the notice of sale published in accordance with this subsection, the date selected for the receipt of bids must be disseminated via an electronic information service at least forty-eight hours prior to the time set for the receipt of the bids. If a fixed date of sale is set forth in the notice of sale, it may be modified by notice disseminated via an electronic information service at least forty-eight hours prior to the time set for the receipt of bids on the modified date of sale. No bonds may be sold pursuant to this section on a date that is more than sixty days after the date of the most recent publication of the notice of sale. Bids for the purchase of bonds may be received in such form as determined by the fire board.\n\n(O) For the payment of the principal and interest of all bonds issued pursuant to this section, as they respectively mature, and for the creation of such sinking fund as may be necessary therefor, the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district shall be irrevocably pledged, and there shall be levied annually by the auditors of Greenville County and Spartanburg County and collected by the treasurers of Greenville County and Spartanburg County, in the same manner as county taxes are levied and collected, a tax without limit on all taxable property in the district sufficient to pay the principal and interest of such bonds as they respectively mature and to create such sinking fund as may be necessary therefor. The taxes levied and collected for the bonds shall be subject to a statutory lien in favor of the purchaser of the bonds.

The bonds additionally may be secured by a pledge of the net revenues that the district may derive from the operation of a revenue-producing facility. In that event, net revenues available must be delivered to the treasurers of Greenville and Spartanburg counties prior to the occasion when the auditors fix the annual levy. The annual ad valorem tax in this section directed to be levied may be reduced each year by the amount of net revenues actually in the hands of the treasurers of Greenville and Spartanburg counties at the time the tax for that year is required to be levied, and the tax may be entirely suspended for any year in case the monies on hand, applicable as aforesaid, are sufficient to pay both principal and interest then due or falling due in that year and remaining unpaid.\n\n(f) The pledge of net revenues authorized by subitem (e), in the discretion of the commission, need not be exclusive and the commission may reserve the right to issue further bonds, payable in whole or in part, from these net revenues, on a parity with the bonds authorized by this subitem under conditions the commission prescribes.\n\n(g) The proceeds derived from the sale of these bonds must be deposited with the treasurers of Greenville and Spartanburg counties in a separate and special fund and must be expended upon the warrants and orders of the commission for the purpose specified in this act, and no others except that any premium received must be deposited with the treasurers of Greenville and Spartanburg counties and applied by them to the first installment of principal becoming due on the bonds, and any accrued interest received must be applied by the treasurers of Greenville and Spartanburg counties to the first installment of interest becoming due on the bonds.

That tax must be uniformly imposed throughout the district. The auditors shall assess and collect the tax as requested, and the treasurers shall hold the funds and disburse them as directed by the commission. All property taxes shall constitute a lien upon the property against which they are levied, on a parity with the lien of county taxes, and the provisions of law relating to penalties for the nonpayment or tardy payment of county taxes, and the provisions relating to sale of property for delinquent county taxes shall apply to taxes levied pursuant to this act;\n\n(18) exercise the power of eminent domain as provided by the laws of this State to acquire any land, any easement, or any right of way for an authorized public purpose; and\n\n(19) do all other acts necessary or convenient to carry out a function or power granted to the district.\n\nHISTORY: 2015 Act No. 48 (H.3304), Section 1, eff June 3, 2015.",
