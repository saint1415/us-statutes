      "text": "The commission is authorized to study all matters relating to the establishment of a single countywide government within the county to be known as a consolidated political subdivision which has powers and jurisdiction throughout the territorial limits of the county and which shall supersede and replace the existing participating governments of the county and of all participating municipalities and all other participating political subdivisions in the county not continued by the charter. For those purposes the commission is authorized to draft a proposed consolidated government charter which may include any provisions necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. To that end and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the commission is authorized to draft a proposed charter which may provide any one or more of the following:\n\n(1) For the abolishment of specified existing governments within the county and for the creation of a new single government having all the powers formerly exercised by the county, special and public service districts, and the municipalities within the county and having such other powers as may be necessary or desirable, including those rights, powers, duties, and liabilities as are now or may be vested in counties or municipalities, or both, by the Constitution or by other provisions of law. However, in those counties where a special purpose district elects to exclude itself from consolidation pursuant to Section 4-8-95, the remaining special purpose districts shall continue to operate as if no consolidation had taken place for the purpose of its special purpose only. The form and composition of the new consolidated political subdivision is as authorized for counties pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9 of Title 4. However, in those counties in which there is located a municipality whose boundaries encompass more than one county, the governing body of that municipality shall make a recommendation to the charter commission as to how that municipality shall comply with the provisions of this section. The commission shall include the recommendations of that municipality in the charter submitted to the qualified electors of the county pursuant to the provisions of Section 4-8-80. No changes in the recommendation by the municipality may be made by the charter commission.\n\n(2) For the new consolidated political subdivision to be eligible to have, hold, enjoy, and be entitled to any assistance, credits, benefits, monies, grants, grants-in-aid, funds, loans, aid, appropriations, and matching funds to the same extent that any county, municipality, or other political subdivisions of the State is entitled or by any other provision of law or under any present or future state or federal programs.\n\n(3) For the abolishment of any public authorities, public service and special purpose districts, boards, and commissions created under acts of the General Assembly relating specifically to the county, public service or special purpose districts, or municipalities concerned and for the transfer of all powers, duties, and obligations of the authorities and special purpose districts to the consolidated political subdivision in the manner provided in the charter. However, the charter may also provide that specified public service districts and special purpose districts may continue to perform the functions assigned to them by law under the supervision of district governing bodies existing prior to the consolidation except that, for those special purpose districts which elect to be excluded from consolidation pursuant to Section 4-8-95, the charter must provide that the special purpose district electing to be excluded may, as permitted under this chapter, continue to perform the functions assigned to them by law as existing before the consolidation.\n\n(4) For the abolishment of any public offices, positions of public employment of the county and of any municipality within the county, created by law of the State, and positions of public employment with any public authorities or special purpose districts located and operated within the county, excluding constitutional officers, members of the judiciary, and persons employed by or elected to serve in the public school system.\n\n(5) For the creation of the governing body of the consolidated political subdivision, including the number of members, their powers, duties, terms of office, manner of election, compensation, method of removal, and all other matters of the governing body subject only to constitutional limitation.\n\n(6) For the creation, modification, and abolishment of various departments, offices, advisory boards, advisory commissions, and positions of public employment of the consolidated political subdivision, all of which must be subordinate branches or employees of the consolidated political subdivision, and all other matters related to it.\n\n(7) For the assumption by the consolidated political subdivision of all bonded indebtedness and all other obligations of whatever kind of all governmental units, public authorities, public service, and special purpose districts which are consolidated by the consolidated government charter and the method by which the consolidated political subdivision shall assume the payment of obligations issued under the Constitution and law of this State.\n\n(8) For the purposes for which the consolidated political subdivision or an agency of it may levy any type tax authorized by law for counties and municipalities and the debt limitations applicable to the consolidated political subdivision or an agency of it, subject to constitutional limitations. As used in this item the term \"taxes\" includes uniform service charges based on services provided which may be levied in conjunction with or in lieu of ad valorem taxes.\n\n(9) For the creation of several classifications of taxing districts by which taxes must be assessed, levied, and collected by the consolidated political subdivision in accordance with the kind, character, type, and degree of services provided within the taxing districts, including a general service district which consists of the total area of the county, and in which must be provided such services as are generally required or demanded by all citizens of the county. The rate and manner of taxation may vary in any one district from that in other districts.\n\n(10) For a method by which the taxing districts are created, other than the general services district, may be expanded or reduced in area, or transformed from one tax district classification to another and a system by which no district may be taxed in any way for services, functions, or programs that are not available or provided to the citizens or property owners of that district.\n\n(11) For the method or methods by which the consolidated political subdivision may be dissolved. Any proposal to disband or dissolve a consolidated political subdivision is not authorized until a consolidated political subdivision has been in existence for a minimum of four years.\n\n(12) For the method or methods by which the charter of the consolidated political subdivision may be amended and municipalities or special purpose districts of the county not included in the initial boundaries of the consolidated political subdivision if any may be annexed to it.\n\nHISTORY: 1992 Act No. 319, Section 3, eff April 8, 1992.",
