(B) When the tax authorized by this article is imposed for more than one purpose, the enacting ordinance must set forth the priority in which the net proceeds are to be expended for the purposes stated. The enacting ordinance may set forth a formula or system by which multiple projects are funded simultaneously. (C)(1) Upon receipt of the ordinance, the county election commission must conduct a referendum on the question of imposing the sales and use tax in the area of the county that is to be subject to the tax. The referendum for imposition or reimposition of the tax must be held at the time of the general election. Subject to item (2), two weeks before the referendum the election commission must publish in a newspaper of general circulation the question that is to appear on the ballot, with the list of projects and the cost of the projects. If the proposed question includes the use of sales taxes to defray debt service on bonds issued to pay the costs of any project, the notice must include a statement indicating that principal amount of the bonds proposed to be issued for the purpose and, if the issuance of the bonds is to be approved as part of the referendum, stating that the referendum includes the authorization of the issuance of bonds in that amount. This notice is in lieu of any other notice otherwise required by law. (2) If the referendum on the question of imposing sales and use tax is conducted in an odd-numbered year, and it is the only matter being considered at the general election, then six weeks before the referendum, the election commission must publish in a newspaper of general circulation the question that is to appear on the ballot, with the list of projects and the cost of the projects. (D) The referendum question to be on the ballot must read substantially as follows: \"Must a special one percent sales and use tax be imposed in (county) for not more than (time) to raise the amounts specified for the following purposes? (1) $________ for __________ (2) $________ for __________ (3) etc. Yes [] No []\" If the referendum includes the issuance of bonds, the question must be revised to include the principal amount of bonds proposed to be authorized by the referendum and the sources of payment of the bonds if the sales tax approved in the referendum is inadequate for the payment of the bonds. (E) All qualified electors desiring to vote in favor of imposing the tax for the stated purposes shall vote \"yes\" and all qualified electors opposed to levying the tax shall vote \"no\". If a majority of the votes cast are in favor of imposing the tax, then the tax is imposed as provided in this article and the enacting ordinance. A subsequent referendum on this question must be held on the date prescribed in subsection (C). The election commission shall conduct the referendum under the election laws of this State, mutatis mutandis, and shall certify the result no later than November thirtieth to the county governing body and to the Department of Revenue. Expenses of the referendum must be paid by the governmental entities that would receive the proceeds of the tax in the same proportion that those entities would receive the net proceeds of the tax. (F) Upon receipt of the returns of the referendum, the county governing body must, by resolution, declare the results thereof. In such event, the results of the referendum, as declared by resolution of the county governing body, are not open to question except by a suit or proceeding instituted within thirty days from the date such resolution is adopted.

The amount so specified must not exceed the amount of sales and use tax proceeds held by the county treasurer for the school district as of the June thirtieth immediately preceding such first day of August. The notice applies only to debt service payments to be made in the eighteen-month period following that June thirtieth. Upon receipt of notice from a school district pursuant to this section, the county treasurer shall certify to the county auditor, by the fifteenth day of August of the amount of sales and use taxes designated by the school district for application to general obligation bond debt service payments. The county auditor shall reduce the next levy of property taxes required to pay debt service on such general obligation bonds by the amount of sales and use tax revenues certified as held by the county treasurer and designated by the school district for the purpose. This amount of sales and use taxes thereafter must not be released to the school district, but must be held by the county treasurer to pay debt service on general obligation bonds. However, any sales and use taxes held by the county treasurer in excess of the amounts designated by the school district for payment of debt service on such general obligation bonds must be expended as directed by the school district in accordance with this article. Any investment earnings derived from the sales and use tax must be expended as directed by the school district in accordance with this article. Any sales and use taxes allocated to a school district and not required to accomplish the purposes described in the resolution of the school district adopted pursuant to Section 4-10-425 may be applied to debt service on any general obligation bonds of the school district. (B) If the school district presents the county treasurer with a surety bond or letter of credit from a financial institution which is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by two national ratings agencies, the county treasurer may treat the amount available under such surety as if it were taxes held by the county treasurer and shall provide the certificate called for in the foregoing paragraph to the auditor by including the amount available under the surety or letter of credit so long as such amount is not in excess of ninety percent of the actual sales and use taxes allocated to the school district in the prior fiscal year, or which would have been allocated if the sales and use tax had been in force for all of the prior fiscal year. The county auditor shall reduce the next levy of ad valorem property taxes required to pay debt service on bonds to which the tax is applicable by the amount so certified by the county treasurer. If the sales and use taxes thereafter allocated to the school district are less than the amount required to pay debt service on bonds during the eighteen-month period established in Section 4-10-445(A), the county treasurer shall draw upon the surety to provide for timely payment of such general obligation bonds. The costs of such surety, including any reimbursements for payments thereon, are deemed to be part of the debt service requirements for such general obligation bonds covered by such surety and may be paid from amounts available in the fund created in accordance with Section 4-10-445(A). Any reimbursement to the financial institution providing such surety may be paid from the fund from taxes collected in the year after any draw.

Once a county meets this threshold it thereafter remains eligible to impose this tax. (B)(1) The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax authorized by this article also may be imposed in a county without regard to the requirements of subsection (A) if: (a) at the time of the referendum, no portion of the county in which the tax is to be imposed is subject to more than two percent total local sales tax; and (b) the county in which the tax is to be imposed is encompassed completely by one entire school district, and that school district also extends into one adjacent county. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax is imposed pursuant to this subsection, then: (a) stated in calendar years, the tax may not be imposed for more than ten years; (b) at least ten percent of the proceeds must be used to provide a credit against existing debt service millage on general obligation bonds in the same manner as in item (3) with the applicable adjustment to the numerator. The offset only may be applied within the county, and not to the portion of the adjacent county, in a manner similar to item (3); and (c) the total debt service on bonds issued by the school district resulting from the imposition, net of any premium or accrued interest, shall not exceed ninety percent of the total amount of Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax proceeds estimated to be allocated to the school district during the imposition, minus any amounts dedicated to the credit required pursuant to subitem (b). The Board of Economic Advisors shall provide the estimate of the total amount. (3)(a) The revenues allotted to the district must be used to provide a nonrefundable credit against the millage imposed for debt service to service bonds issued by the district resulting from the imposition, on property taxable in the county only. The amount of the credit is determined by multiplying the value of the taxable property, before the exemption provided in Section 12-37-250, by a fraction in which the numerator is the total estimated revenue allotted to the district during the applicable fiscal year of the district minus the amounts set forth in item (2), and the denominator is the total of the property tax value of taxable property in the county as defined pursuant to Section 12-37-3135(5), including the value exempted in Section 12-37-250, in the district as of January first of the applicable property tax year. For motor vehicles subject to the payment of property taxes pursuant to Article 21, Chapter 37, Title 12, the credit provided pursuant to this subsection applies against the tax liability for motor vehicle tax years beginning after December of the year in which the credit is calculated. The credit applies first against the liability arising from millage imposed for debt obligations for schools, and then against any liability arising from school operations. (b) The credit provided by this article is in addition to any credits allowed pursuant to Article 1 of this chapter, and to the extent that there is unused credit, then the credit provided by this article may be applied proportionately against other property tax liability. (c) Before the provisions of subitem (b) apply, an amount equal to the credit that would apply against the property tax liability for school operations imposed on an owner-occupied residence but for the exemption allowed pursuant to Section 12-37-220(B)(47) is allowed as a credit to be applied proportionately against all nonschool-related property tax otherwise due on the residence. (d) If proceeds from the imposition are unused after the termination of the tax, then the unused funds must be used to provide a credit in the same manner as provided in subitem (a) over the next three property tax years. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if, within a county there is imposed the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax pursuant to this subsection, then no other local sales tax may be imposed in that county if the subsequent imposition causes the total sales tax to exceed two percent in any portion of the county. This limitation applies so long as this subsection is utilized to impose the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the tax imposed pursuant to this subsection and another sales tax are approved at the same referendum, and the approval of both subjects any portion of the county to more than two percent total local sales tax, then only the tax whose approving resolution was adopted first may be imposed, and the other tax is deemed to not have been approved. (6) For purposes of this subsection, a sales tax is a tax levied pursuant to this chapter, pursuant to Chapter 37, Title 4, or pursuant to any local law enacted by the General Assembly. (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax authorized by this article also may be imposed in a county so long as the county or school district imposed a local sales and use tax to fund education capital improvements on January 1, 2014. The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax may be imposed pursuant to this subsection at any time after the local sales and use tax terminates. (D) The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax authorized by this article also may be imposed in a county which does not meet the collection requirements of subsection (A) so long as: (1) the county only has one school district which encompasses the entire county area in which the tax is to be imposed; and (2) the county collected at least one million dollars in state accommodations taxes as imposed pursuant to Section 12-36-920(A) in the most recent fiscal year for which full collection figures are available. Once a county meets this threshold, it thereafter remains eligible to impose this tax pursuant to this subsection. (E)(1) The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax authorized by this article also may be imposed in a county which does not meet the collection requirements of subsection (A) so long as the county in which the tax is to be imposed: (a) is comprised of more than one school district and the county has a county board of education; and (b) has no other local sales tax imposition at the time of the referendum. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax is imposed pursuant to this subsection, then: (a) at least ten percent of the proceeds must be used to provide property tax relief by using the proceeds to offset the existing debt service millage levy on general obligation bonds pursuant to Section 4-10-445; and (b) the tax revenue distributed to each district must be in the proportion that the district's average daily membership (ADM) attributes to the total ADM of all the school districts in the county, limited to ADM attributable to the county. (3) The resolution required pursuant to Section 4-10-425 must be agreed to by a majority vote of the board of trustees of each school district located in whole or in part in the county. (4) For purposes of this subsection, a sales tax is a tax levied pursuant to this chapter, pursuant to Chapter 37, Title 4, or pursuant to any local law enacted by the General Assembly. (5) Once a county meets the provisions of item (1) and imposes the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax, it thereafter remains eligible to impose this tax pursuant to this subsection. (F) The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax authorized by this article also may be imposed in a county which does not meet the collection requirements of subsection (A) so long as: (1) immediately prior to the imposition date, if approved, the county is imposing the local option sales tax imposed pursuant to Article 1, and the county had not imposed that tax for twenty years or more as of the date the imposition of the education capital improvements sales tax authorized in this article was first proposed in that county in a 2014 referendum, in which any portion of a calendar year counts as a year, and no other local sales and use tax that is administered by the Department of Revenue is imposed in the county; and (2) the county collected at least one hundred thousand dollars in state accommodations taxes as imposed pursuant to Section 12-36-920(A) in the most recent fiscal year for which full collection figures are available. Once a county meets the provisions of item (1) and the threshold in item (2), it thereafter remains eligible to impose this tax pursuant to this subsection.

The county council must obtain from the Board of Economic Advisors the board's certified estimate of the rate of sales and use tax necessary in the county to equal property tax revenues derived from private passenger motor vehicles, motorcycles, general aviation aircraft, boats, and boat motors in the latest completed fiscal year. If this rate exceeds two percent, the maximum rate the board may certify is two percent. This certified rate is the rate of tax that must appear in the referendum question. If the revenue of a two percent tax does not at least equal the revenue not collected, then for the first year of implementation, the shortfall must be made up by a distribution to the county from the Trust Fund for Tax Relief, and this distribution is considered additional sales tax revenue pursuant to this article. Thereafter, this distribution must be adjusted by an amount equal to any increase in the consumer price index in the most recently completed calendar year, but in no case may this distribution result in a reimbursement to a county that exceeds the personal property tax revenue not collected because of the exemption allowed by this article.

This new rate applies effective beginning with the month the assessment ratio changes and continues to apply while that assessment ratio applies or until the tax is rescinded.

The ordinance may provide for a credit against the property tax liability for the county or the school district(s) in the county, or the property tax liability for both the county and the school district(s) in the county. An ordinance must be enacted or a petition initiating an ordinance must be presented to the county governing body at least one hundred twenty days before the Tuesday following the first Monday of November of that year. (2) The rate of the tax must be set at an amount expressed in tenths of one percent estimated to be sufficient to produce revenues that do not exceed those necessary to replace property tax revenue in the county for the affected political subdivisions in the most recently completed fiscal year, but not more than one percent and must take into account reimbursements received by political subdivisions for property tax exemptions. (3) If the county or municipality within the county has enacted a tax increment financing redevelopment plan, or other financing plan that relies upon property tax for its funding to retire indebtedness or pay for project costs, the rate of tax must be set in an amount that must consider full funding for the project or retirement of indebtedness, which must include compliance with any covenants in the governing documents authorizing this indebtedness or future indebtedness heretofore authorized by the tax increment financing redevelopment plan that relies upon property tax for its funding for the amount that the sales tax would substitute for the property tax payments. The revenues of such tax attributable to the funding replacement for a tax increment redevelopment financing plan that relies upon property tax for its funding must be distributed by the county treasurer pursuant to Section 4-10-780. (4) The governing body of the county shall obtain from RFA after RFA has obtained all information necessary to provide such estimate, a certified estimate of the rate of sales and use tax necessary in the county to equal the property tax not collected, and for the amount, if applicable, for the funding replacement for the tax increment financing redevelopment plan or other financing plan that relies upon property tax for its funding. This certified rate, not to exceed one percent, is the rate of tax that must appear in the referendum question. (5) A qualified elector of the county desiring to circulate a petition shall file a written request with the governing body of the county detailing the property tax liability or liabilities to which the credit will apply and the governing body shall forward the request to RFA, which shall design the petition form in consultation with the State Election Commission and calculate and certify the tax rate necessary to provide the credits proposed in the petition. The petition form and a copy of the certification must be forwarded to the governing body of the county and the governing body shall provide the petition form to the qualified elector requesting the petition form. (6) If competing petitions are timely filed with the governing body of the county and the signatures verified, the governing body may determine which petition initiated ordinance shall go on the ballot or it may substitute its own ordinance in lieu of any petition initiated ordinance. (B) If the sales and use tax authorized pursuant to this article is imposed in a county, then the sales and use tax revenue must be used to provide a credit against the property tax liability on all classes of property by the affected political subdivision.

(2) Revenues received in the second and subsequent years of imposition must be used as provided in item (1) except that up to twenty percent may be retained by the municipality and used as follows: (a) at least twenty percent of the amount retained must be used to provide a credit against the property tax liability imposed by the municipality on parcels of owner-occupied residential property located in the municipality classified for property taxes pursuant to Section 12-43-220(c). The credit is an amount determined by multiplying the appraised value of the residence by a fraction in which the numerator is the total estimated revenue retained by the municipality allocated to the credit and the denominator is the total of the appraised value of all such property in the municipality as of January first of the applicable property tax year. For purposes of this calculation, appraised value is as defined in Section 12-37-3130(3) reduced by the limitation provided pursuant to Section 12-37-3140(B); (b) the balance for tourism-related capital projects. No capital project is eligible to be funded directly or indirectly with fee revenues unless the project consists of construction of new or renovation of existing tourism-related facilities intended to grow or maintain the overnight tourism market in the municipality; and (c) the credit allowed pursuant to subitem (a) of this item applies after all other credits have been applied. To the extent that the credit amount allowed by this item exceeds the municipal property tax liability, the excess credit is added to the amount set aside for use as provided in subitem (b) of this item. If no projects are funded pursuant to subitem (b) of this item, the excess credit must be used to provide a credit against the municipal tax liability of all taxable property in the municipality ineligible for the credit allowed by subitem (a) of this item. This credit must be calculated in the same manner as the credit provided in subitem (a), mutatis mutandis. (B) The municipality shall designate no more than two organizations within the county to receive the revenues and interest and conduct the promotional activities provided pursuant to subsection (A)(1). These organizations must be nonprofit destination marketing organizations representing a broad cross-section of tourism interests within the county. In addition, before an organization may be designated, it must certify to the imposing municipality that: (1) its promotional and advertising programs are based on research based outcomes; (2) the organization has a proven record of success in creating new and repeat visitation to the county; (3) it has sufficient resources to create, plan, implement, and measure the marketing program generated by the fee revenues; (4) it will use the funds only for the purposes provided pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this section. (C) Municipalities located in the same county that are imposing a fee pursuant to this article jointly may designate a regional tourism promoter located in the county to jointly promote tourism in the municipalities imposing the fee. The regional tourism promoter must be designated in the manner provided in subsection (B) and only may promote tourism to non-South Carolina residents. (D) At least quarterly, an organization designated by the municipality pursuant to this section shall provide a report to the municipality that includes identification of revenues received from the Local Option Tourism Development Fee during the previous quarter, as well as expenditures made from those funds during the previous quarter. Each report also shall be posted by the organization on its website.

An enacting ordinance must specify: (1) the purpose for which the proceeds of the tax are to be used, which may include preservation procurements located within or without, or both within and without, the boundaries of the local governmental entities, including the county, municipalities, and special purpose districts located in the county area; (2) if the county proposes to issue bonds to provide for the payment of any costs of the preservation procurements, the maximum amount of bonds to be issued, whether the sales tax proceeds are to be pledged to the payment of the bonds and, if other sources of funds are to be used for the preservation procurements, a list of the other sources; (3) the maximum cost of the preservation procurements, to be funded from the proceeds of the tax or bonds issued as provided in this article and the maximum amount of net proceeds expected to be used to pay the cost or debt service on the bonds, as the case may be; and (4) the fact that preservation procurements may pertain to real property situated outside of the boundaries of the taxing jurisdiction. (B) Upon receipt of an ordinance, a county's election commission must conduct a referendum on the question of imposing the sales and use tax in the area of the county that is to be subject to the tax. A referendum for imposition or reimposition of the tax must be held at the time of the next general election in an even-numbered year. Two weeks before a referendum, a county's election commission must publish in a newspaper of general circulation the question that is to appear on the ballot, with a description of the methods by which the county's governing body intends to procure open lands and green space for preservation. If the proposed question includes the use of sales taxes to defray debt service on bonds issued to pay the costs of any preservation procurements, then the notice must include a statement indicating the principal amount of the bonds proposed to be issued for the purpose and, if the issuance of the bonds is to be approved as part of the referendum, stating that the referendum includes the authorization of the issuance of bonds in that amount. This notice is in lieu of any other notice otherwise required by law. (C) The referendum question to be on the ballot must read substantially as follows: \"Must a special [percent] sales and use tax be imposed in [county] for not more than [time] to raise the amounts specified for preservation procurements for the purpose of procuring open lands and green space by and through the acquisition of interests in real property, such interests to include: (a) the acquisition of fee simple titles; (b) conservation easements; (c) development rights; (d) rights of first refusal; (e) options; (f) leases with options to purchase; or (g) any other interests in real property? Yes [] No []\" If the referendum includes the issuance of bonds, then the question must be revised to include the principal amount of bonds proposed to be authorized by the referendum and the sources of payment of the bonds if the sales tax approved in the referendum is inadequate for the payment of the bonds. (D) All qualified electors desiring to vote in favor of imposing the tax for the stated purposes shall vote \"yes\", and all qualified electors opposed to levying the tax shall vote \"no\". If a majority of the votes cast are in favor of imposing the tax, then the tax is imposed as provided in this article and the enacting ordinance. Any subsequent referendum on this question must be held on the date prescribed in subsection (B). The election commission shall conduct the referendum under the election laws of this State, mutatis mutandis, and shall certify the result no later than November thirtieth to the county governing body and to the Department of Revenue. Expenses of the referendum must be paid by the governmental entities that would receive the proceeds of the tax in the same proportion as those entities would receive the net proceeds of the tax. (E) Upon receipt of the returns of a referendum, a county's governing body must, by resolution, declare the results thereof. In such event, the results of the referendum, as declared by resolution of the county's governing body, are not open to question except by a suit or proceeding instituted within thirty days from the date such resolution is adopted.
