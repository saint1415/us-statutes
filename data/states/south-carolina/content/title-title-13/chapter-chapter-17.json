The innovation centers shall:\n\n(1) enhance the research and technology transition capabilities of the state's three research universities;\n\n(2) establish a continuing forum to foster greater dialogue between the state's three research universities and industry;\n\n(3) promote the development of high technology industries and applied research facilities in South Carolina;\n\n(4) focus their efforts on the development, testing, and implementation of new advances in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, hydrogen and fuel cells, military and defense technology, chemical products, high tech fibers, advanced materials, automotive, aerospace, and information technology; and\n\n(5) maximize the use of the funds and activities of the innovation centers for partnerships among the research universities and between the public and private sectors for the purpose of generating professional research and development jobs in South Carolina.\n\n(B) The SCRIC shall operate in conjunction with the three research universities in South Carolina. One innovation center must be located in each of the following areas; except that an innovation center and its activities are not otherwise required to be at a particular location:\n\n(1) Charleston, to be associated with the Medical University of South Carolina;\n\n(2) Columbia, to be associated with the University of South Carolina; and\n\n(3) the Upstate, to be associated with Clemson University.\n\n(C) Each of the three innovation centers may have a center director appointed or removed with the advice and consent of the president of the research university associated with the respective center. Staff for innovation centers should encompass a variety of specialty areas, which may include market research, intellectual property protection, finance, management and business practices, relevant science and technology, industry research partner recruitment, and other specific skills as required to advise and assist start-up companies, pre-company initiatives, or launch new products. Consulting services may be obtained for specialized needs not otherwise met by existing staff personnel.\n\n(D)(1) The SCRIC must be funded by a direct payment of funds by the SCRA for at least the first three years of the centers' existence. The payments must be at least three million dollars for the first year and at least four million dollars for the second year. After the second year, the board of trustees shall determine the method and payment of funds. By the end of the third year, total funding dedicated to the SCRIC for startup must be twelve million dollars; however, the board of trustees may provide a portion of the twelve million dollars with funds generated by other means as determined by the board. Additionally, all remaining vacant land, excluding those parcels mutually agreed upon by the SCRA and the university to which the land is geographically associated, not currently in use by the SCRA for its core mission in the Clemson Research Park in Anderson County and in the Carolina Research Park in Columbia as well as the authority's land located at the intersection of Line Street and Hagood Avenue in downtown Charleston may be dedicated to the benefit of the innovation centers or sold to account for part of the twelve million dollar payment. If the land is not sold, the board of trustees shall determine how best to use this land for the benefit of the innovation centers consistent with the plans of the university to which the land is geographically associated. Any revenue, net of expenses generated from this land, including but not limited to the sale of this land, must be used for the benefit of the innovation centers. If land is offered for sale by the SCRA, it must be offered first to the university associated with the innovation center before it is offered to the public or to another potential buyer.\n\n(2) After the initial three-year period, the State shall explore methods to provide additional funding until the innovation centers have a reasonable opportunity to become self-sustaining. These methods may include direct appropriation from the general fund, private donations, or other funds as necessary.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section 73.18(A) of Part IB of the General Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2004-2005, or any subsequent appropriations bills or other legislation, the land identified in Section 13-17-87(D)(1) and any additional real property owned or held by SCRA now or in the future must be titled in the name of, and under the control of, the SCRA.\n\n(E) Costs associated with the physical space for the innovation centers including, but not limited to, the costs to acquire, lease, or build the physical space and to up fit the physical space, may be financed through the issuance of general obligation debt to the maximum extent allowed by Chapter 51, Title 11, the South Carolina Research University Infrastructure Act, by private match funding, from the budget of the authority, or by other means; provided, however, that in no event shall there be a pledge of the credit and taxing power of the State or a political subdivision of the State in connection with this financing. The facilities and programs at each site may be tailored to the predominant research focuses of that area. Each may contain wet and dry laboratory space, office space, prototype production facilities, pilot operations, clean rooms, and other specialized facilities.\n\n(F) The SCRIC may:\n\n(1) admit qualified companies including, but not limited to, start-up companies, new product initiatives, and pre-company initiatives into a center and grant these companies up to two hundred thousand dollars each as well as physical and staff resources;\n\n(2) solicit grants and other financial support from federal, local, and private sources and fees, royalties, and other resources from innovation center users, which ultimately should enable the innovation centers to become self-sufficient;\n\n(3) allow a company to remain in an innovation center for up to five years or until exceeding five million dollars in annual commercial revenue; provided, however, that this requirement may not apply with respect to thirty-five percent of the square feet in an innovation center, as determined by the SCRA;\n\n(4) allow rent and fees for services initially to be waived; and\n\n(5) provide financing to qualified companies.\n\n(G) The SCRIC shall use monetary grants for proof-of-concept studies, Small Business Innovation Research program matches, the protection of intellectual property, and other similar uses. Early support programs must support specialized equipment, facilities, staff assistance, and recruitment for consultants for specific projects. These support programs may be modified quarterly based on the progress of the company or new product.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 133, Section 1, eff June 7, 2005; 2006 Act No. 319, Section 6, eff June 1, 2006; 2012 Act No. 209, Section 4, eff June 7, 2012; 2022 Act No. 172 (S.635), Section 3, eff May 16, 2022.",
