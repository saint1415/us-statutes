Such additional payment shall include the following elements: (a) The amount, if any, which when added to the acquisition cost of the dwelling acquired, equals the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling which is a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling adequate to accommodate such displaced person, reasonably accessible to public services and places of employment and available on the private market.

The discount rate shall be determined by regulations issued pursuant to Section 55-15-70. (c) Reasonable expenses incurred by such displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not including prepaid expenses.

(2) Where a condemnation proceeding is instituted by the public authority under the laws of this State to acquire real property and (a) the final judgment is that the real property cannot be acquired by condemnation or (b) the proceeding is abandoned, the owner of any right, title, or interest in such real property shall be paid by the public authority such sum as will, in the opinion of the public authority, reimburse such owner for his reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees, actually incurred because of the condemnation proceeding. (3) Where an inverse condemnation proceeding is instituted by the owner of any right, title, or interest in real property, the court, rendering a judgment for the plaintiff in such proceeding and awarding compensation for the taking of property, or the public authority's attorney effecting a settlement of any such proceeding, shall determine and award or allow to such plaintiff, as a part of such judgment or settlement, such sum as will, in the opinion of the court or the public authority's attorney, reimburse such plaintiff for his reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal and engineering fees, actually incurred because of such proceeding. (4) The public authority, in acquiring real property which they have the power to acquire under the eminent domain or condemnation laws of this State shall comply with the following policies: (a) Every reasonable effort shall be made to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation. (b) Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property. (c) Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an amount must be established which it is reasonably believed is just compensation for it and the amount must be offered for the property. In no event shall the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property. Any decrease or increase of the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which such property is acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation. Where appropriate the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. (d) No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the agreed purchase price is paid or deposited with a court having jurisdiction of condemnation of such property, in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding of such property. (e) The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling, assuming a replacement dwelling will be available, or to move his business or farm operation without at least ninety days' written notice from the date by which such move is required. (f) If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier. (g) In no event shall the time of condemnation be advanced, on negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, or any other coercive action be taken to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property. (h) If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted. The public authority shall not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his real property. (i) If the acquisition of only part of the property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire the entire property shall be made. (5)(a) Where any interest in real property is acquired, an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property so acquired and which is required to be removed from such real property or which is determined to be adversely affected by the use to which such real property will be put shall be acquired. (b) For the purpose of determining the just compensation to be paid for any building, structure, or other improvement required to be acquired as above set forth, such building, structure, or other improvement shall be deemed to be a part of the real property to be acquired notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant, as against the owner of any other interest in the real property, to remove such building, structure, or improvement at the expiration of his term, and the fair market value which such building, structure, or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the property to be acquired, or the fair market value of such building, structure, or improvement for removal from the real property, whichever is the greater, must be paid to the tenant for it. (c) Payment for such buildings, structures, or improvements as set forth above shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by state law. No such payment shall be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release all his right, title, and interest in and to such improvements. Nothing with regard to the above-mentioned acquisition of buildings, structures, or other improvements shall be construed to deprive the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for such property interests in accordance with other laws of this State.
