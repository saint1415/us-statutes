      "text": "All bonds issued by a governing board under authority of this chapter shall be limited obligations of the city. The principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, shall be payable solely out of the moneys to be derived by such city pursuant to the loan agreement. Bonds and interest coupons issued under authority of this chapter shall never constitute an indebtedness of the city within the meaning of any State constitutional provision or statutory limitation and shall never constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the city or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and such fact shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. The bonds may be executed and delivered as a single issue or from time to time as several issues, may be in such form and denominations, may be of such tenor, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in such installments and at such times not exceeding forty years from their date, may be subject to such terms of redemption, may be payable at such places, may bear interest at such rates as the governing board and the developer shall agree upon without limitation, may be payable at such places and evidenced in such manner, may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all of which shall be provided in the proceedings of the governing board authorizing the bonds. Any bonds issued under the authority of this chapter may be sold at public or private sale, at such price and in such manner, and from time to time as may be determined by the governing board to be most advantageous and the governing board may pay as a part of the cost of acquiring any land and out of the bond proceeds all expenses, premiums and commissions which the governing board may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of bonds. All bonds, except registered bonds which are registered otherwise than to bearer, and all interest coupons appurtenant thereto shall be construed to be negotiable instruments despite the fact that they are payable solely from a specified source. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide for the issuance in the future of further bonds on a parity with those initially issued.\n\nPending the issuance of bonds, bond anticipation notes may be issued and to the end that a vehicle be provided therefor, the provisions of Sections 11-17-10 to 11-17-110 as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to such bond anticipatory borrowing.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 36-453; 1974 (58) 2337.",

The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued or any trust indenture may contain any agreement or provisions customarily contained in instruments securing such obligations, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions respecting the fixing and collection of the sums payable by the developer to the city pursuant to the loan agreement; the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings or other facilities or improvements upon the land, the creation and maintenance of special funds by the developer, the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the bondholders or to the trustee under such trust indenture, all as the governing board shall deem advisable; provided, however, that in making any such agreements or provisions, no city shall have the power to obligate itself except with respect to any security pledged, mortgaged or otherwise made available by the developer for the securing of the bonds, and the application of the revenues from the loan agreement and shall not have the power to incur a pecuniary liability or charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers. The proceedings authorizing any bonds and any trust indenture securing bonds may provide that in the event of default in payment of the principal of, or interest on such bonds, or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or trust indenture, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by appointment of a receiver in equity with such powers as may be necessary to enforce the obligations thereof. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon any city or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers.\n\nThe trustees under any trust indenture or any depository specified by such trust indenture may be such persons or corporations as the governing board shall designate, notwithstanding that they may be nonresidents of South Carolina, or incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 36-454; 1974 (58) 2337.",
