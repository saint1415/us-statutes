      "text": "(A) A manufacturing or industrial facility, or expansion of such a facility, may not be found to be a public or private nuisance by reason of the operation of that facility if the manufacturing or industrial facility: (1) is operating pursuant to and in compliance with the requisite licenses, permits, certifications, or authorizations under the applicable federal and state environmental laws and county and municipal zoning and nuisance ordinances; and (2) commenced operations before the landowner alleging the nuisance acquired, moved onto, or improved the affected property.

This protected status of a manufacturing or industrial facility, once acquired: (1) is assignable, alienable, and inheritable, provided the manufacturing or industrial facility is operating for the same use as when it commenced operations as provided in subsection (A)(2) or a reasonable expansion thereof as provided in this subsection; and (2) may not be waived by the temporary cessation of operation for a period not to exceed two years or by diminishing the size of the operation.
