      "text": "(A) A local government, including a municipality or county, may create and operate an LHTF or RHTF by ordinance, or join an existing trust fund to implement either a local or regional program for affordable housing as defined in this chapter. A local government may jointly form a regional housing trust fund by ordinance. A regional housing trust fund created under this chapter is subject to the same requirement and has the same power as a local housing trust fund created by an individual local government.\n\n(B) A local government that creates an LHTF or RHTF may finance the LHTF or RHTF with money available to the local government through its budgeting authority unless expressly prohibited by the law of this State. Sources of these funds include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:\n\n(1) donations;\n\n(2) bond proceeds; and\n\n(3) grants and loans from a state, federal, or private source.\n\nThe local government may alter a source of funding for the LHTF or RHTF by amending the ordinance that establishes financing for the LHTF or RHTF, but only if sufficient funds exist to cover the projected debts or expenditures authorized by the LHTF or RHTF in its budget. This chapter does not create, grant, or confer a new or additional tax or revenue authority to a local government or political subdivision of the State unless otherwise provided by the law of this State.\n\n(C) A local government operating an LHTF or RHTF shall safeguard the fund in the same manner as the general fund or a separate utility fund established for specific purposes. The LHTF or RHTF may be included in the required financial expense reports or annual audit for each local government.\n\n(D) A local government operating an LHTF or RHTF may allocate funds to a program that promotes the development or rehabilitation of affordable housing as defined in this chapter. Regarding the distribution of funds from an LHTF or RHTF, preference must be given to a program or project that promotes the development or rehabilitation of affordable housing for an individual or family with an annual income at or below fifty percent of the median income for the local area, adjusted for family size according to current data from HUD, the development or rehabilitation of special needs housing, or the development or rehabilitation of homeless housing.\n\n(E) LHTF or RHTF funds may be used to match other funds from federal, state, or private resources, including the State Housing Trust Fund. A local government shall seek additional resources for housing programs and projects to the maximum extent practicable. A local government shall administer its housing trust fund through new or existing nonprofit organizations to encourage private charitable donation to the funds. Where an LHTF or RHTF receives such a donation, the donation must be used and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(F) An LHTF or RHTF established, utilized, or funded under this chapter must provide an annual report to the local government that created the fund. The local government shall require the LHTF or RHTF to provide an accounting of its funds each year. This report must be made available to the public by posting on the appropriate website of the local government.\n\nHISTORY: 2007 Act No. 19, Section 2, eff May 15, 2007.",
