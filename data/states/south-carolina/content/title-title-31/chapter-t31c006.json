      "text": "(A) The General Assembly finds that: (1) Section 14 of Article X of the Constitution of South Carolina provides that the General Assembly may authorize by general law that indebtedness for the purpose of redevelopment within incorporated municipalities may be incurred and that the debt service of such indebtedness be provided from the added increments of tax revenues to result from the project. (2) An increasing demand for public services must be provided from a limited tax base. Incentives must be provided for redevelopment in areas which are, or threaten to become, predominantly slum or blighted. (3) There exist in many municipalities of this State blighted and conservation areas; the conservation areas are rapidly deteriorating and declining and may soon become blighted areas if their decline is not checked; the stable economic and physical development of the blighted areas and conservation areas is endangered by the presence of blighting factors as manifested by progressive and advanced deterioration of structures, by the overuse of housing and other facilities, by a lack of physical maintenance of existing structures, by obsolete and inadequate community facilities, and a lack of sound community planning, by obsolete platting, diversity of ownership, excessive tax and special assessment delinquencies, or by a combination of these factors; that as a result of the existence of blighted areas and areas requiring conservation, there is an excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds, inadequate public and private investment, unmarketability of property, growth in delinquencies and crime, and substandard housing conditions and zoning law violations in such areas together with an abnormal exodus of families and businesses so that the decline of these areas impairs the value of private investments and threatens the sound growth and the tax base of taxing districts in such areas, and threatens the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public. (4) In order to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public, blighted conditions need to be eradicated and conservation measures instituted and redevelopment of such areas undertaken; to remove and alleviate adverse conditions it is necessary to encourage private investment and restore and enhance the tax base of the taxing districts in such areas by the redevelopment of project areas. The eradication of blighted areas and treatment and improvement of areas by redevelopment projects is declared to be essential to the public interest. (4.5) There exists in or contiguous to many municipalities in the State large tracts of land which served the people of this State and its economy when originally developed and maintained over the generations as agricultural property, contributing food, fiber, timber, and pulpwood, and which now, in an evolving economy and amidst a much smaller, yet vastly more efficient agricultural economy, are in need of redevelopment to provide multiple uses utilizing the redevelopment tools provided in this chapter. (5) The use of incremental tax revenues derived from the tax rates of various taxing districts in redevelopment project areas for the payment of redevelopment project costs is of benefit to the taxing districts because taxing districts located in redevelopment project areas would not derive the benefits of an increased assessment base without the benefits of tax increment financing, all surplus tax revenues are turned over to the taxing districts in redevelopment project areas, and all taxing districts benefit from the removal of blighted conditions, the eradication of conditions requiring conservation measures, and the redevelopment of agricultural areas. (B) The General Assembly intends to implement the authorization granted in Article X, Section 14, of the Constitution of this State. The authorization in this chapter provides for this State an essential method for financing redevelopment. The governing bodies of the incorporated municipalities are vested with all powers consistent with the Constitution necessary, useful, and desirable to enable them to accomplish redevelopment in areas which are or threaten to become blighted and to sufficiently meet all constitutional requirements pertaining to incurring indebtedness for the purpose of redevelopment and funding the debt service of such indebtedness from the added increment of tax revenues to result from such redevelopment as provided in subsection (10) of Section 14 of Article X of the Constitution of this State. The indebtedness incurred pursuant to subsection (10) of Section 14 of Article X of the Constitution is exempt from all debt limitations imposed by Article X. The powers granted in this chapter must be in all respects exercised for the benefit of the inhabitants of the State, for the increase of its commerce, and for the promotion of its welfare and prosperity. (C) All action taken by any municipality in carrying out the purposes of this chapter will perform essential governmental functions. (D) Pursuant to the authorization granted in Article VIII, Section 13, of the Constitution of this State, if a redevelopment project area is located in more than one municipality, the powers granted herein may be exercised jointly.

      "text": "Obligations secured by the special tax allocation fund set forth in Section 31-6-70 for the redevelopment project area may be issued to provide for redevelopment project costs. The obligations, when so issued, must be retired in the manner provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the obligations by the receipts of taxes levied as specified in Section 31-6-110 against the taxable property included in the area and other revenue as specified in Section 31-6-110 designated by the municipality which source does not involve revenues from any tax or license. In the ordinance the municipality may pledge all or any part of the funds in and to be deposited in the special tax allocation fund created pursuant to Section 31-6-70 to the payment of the redevelopment project costs and obligations. Any pledge of funds in the special tax allocation fund must provide for distribution to the taxing districts of monies not required for payment and securing of the obligations and the excess funds are surplus funds. In the event a municipality only pledges a portion of the monies in the special tax allocation fund for the payment of redevelopment project costs or obligations, any funds remaining in the special tax allocation fund after complying with the requirements of the pledge are also considered surplus funds. All surplus funds must be distributed annually to the taxing districts in the redevelopment project area by being paid by the municipality to the county treasurer of the county in which the municipality is located. The county treasurer shall immediately thereafter make distribution to the respective taxing districts in the same manner and proportion as the most recent distribution by the county treasurer to the affected districts of real property taxes from real property in the redevelopment project area. In addition to obligations secured by the special tax allocation fund, the municipality may pledge for a period not greater than the term of the obligations toward payment of the obligations any part of the revenues remaining after payment of operation and maintenance, of all or part of any redevelopment project. The obligations may be issued in one or more series, may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their respective dates, may bear such rate or rates of interest as the governing body shall determine, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be in such form, either coupon or registered, may carry such registration and conversion privileges, may be executed in such manner, may be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, may be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium, may be declared or become due before the maturity date thereof, may provide for the replacement of mutilated, destroyed, stolen, or lost bonds, may be authenticated in such manner and upon compliance with such conditions, and may contain such other terms and covenants, as may be provided by the governing body of the municipality. If the governing body determines to sell any obligations the obligations must be sold at public or private sale in such manner and upon such terms as the governing body considers best for the interest of the municipality. A certified copy of the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the obligations must be filed with the clerk of the governing body of each county and treasurer of each county in which any portion of the municipality is situated and shall constitute the authority for the extension and collection of the taxes to be deposited in the special tax allocation fund. A municipality also may issue its obligations to refund in whole or in part obligations previously issued by the municipality under the authority of this chapter, whether at or prior to maturity, and all references in this chapter to \"obligations\" are considered to include these refunding obligations. The debt incurred by a municipality pursuant to this chapter is exclusive of any statutory limitation upon the indebtedness a taxing district may incur. All obligations issued pursuant to this chapter shall contain a statement on the face of the obligation specifying the sources from which payment is to be made and shall state that the full faith, credit, and taxing powers are not pledged for the obligations. The trustee or depositary under any indenture may be such persons or corporations as the governing body designates, or they may be nonresidents of South Carolina or incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States.

Any ordinance adopted based on acts of the municipality occurring before the effective date of this chapter must incorporate by reference and adopt those prior acts undertaken in accordance with the procedures of this chapter as if they had been undertaken pursuant to this chapter. Obligations may be issued subsequent to the initial ten-year period.

Upon the payment of all redevelopment project costs, retirement of all obligations of a municipality issued under this chapter, and the distribution of any surplus monies pursuant to this section, the municipality shall adopt an ordinance dissolving the tax allocation fund for the project redevelopment area and terminating the designation of the redevelopment project area as a redevelopment project area for purposes of this chapter. Thereafter, the rates of the taxing districts must be extended and taxes levied, collected, and distributed in the manner applicable in the absence of the adoption of a redevelopment plan and the issuance of obligations under this chapter. If ten years have passed from the time a redevelopment project area is designated and the municipality has not issued the initial obligations under this chapter to finance the redevelopment project, upon the expiration of the ten-year term, the municipality shall adopt an ordinance terminating the designation of the redevelopment project area.

Notice of the adoption of the ordinance must be published by the municipality in a newspaper having general circulation in the affected taxing districts. Any interested party may, within twenty days after the date of publication of the notice of adoption of the redevelopment plan, but not afterwards, challenge the validity of such adoption by action de novo in the court of common pleas in the county in which the redevelopment plan is located.

The proposed changes shall become effective only with respect to affected taxing districts that consent to the proposed changes by resolution of the governing body of the taxing districts. (b) The municipality must publish notice of the adoption of the ordinance in a newspaper having general circulation in the affected taxing districts. Any interested party may, within twenty days after the date of publication of the notice of adoption of the redevelopment plan, but not afterwards, challenge the validity of the adoption by action de novo in the court of common pleas in the county in which the redevelopment plan is located.

      "text": "(A) If a municipality by ordinance approves a redevelopment plan pursuant to Section 31-6-80, the auditor of the county in which the municipality is situated, immediately after adoption of the ordinance pursuant to Section 31-6-80, must, upon request of the municipality, determine and certify: (1) the most recently ascertained equalized assessed value of all taxable real property within the redevelopment project area, as of the date of adoption of the ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 31-6-80, which value is the \"initial equalized assessed value\" of the property; and (2) the total equalized assessed value of all taxable real property within the redevelopment project area and certifying the amount as the \"total initial equalized assessed value\" of the taxable real property within the redevelopment project area. (B) After the county auditor has certified the total initial equalized assessed value of the taxable real property in the area, then in respect to every taxing district containing a redevelopment project area, the county auditor or any other official required by law to ascertain the amount of the equalized assessed value of all taxable property within the district for the purpose of computing the rate percent of tax to be extended upon taxable property within such district, shall in every year that obligations are outstanding for redevelopment projects in the redevelopment area ascertain the amount of value of taxable property in a project redevelopment area by including in the amount the certified total initial equalized assessed value of all taxable real property in the area in lieu of the equalized assessed value of all taxable real property in the area. The rate percent of tax determined must be extended to the current equalized assessed value of all property in the redevelopment project area in the same manner as the rate percent of tax is extended to all other taxable property in the taxing district. The method of extending taxes established under this section terminates when the municipality adopts an ordinance dissolving the special tax allocation fund for the redevelopment project.
