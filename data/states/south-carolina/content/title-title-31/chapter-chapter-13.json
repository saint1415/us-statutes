The trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including convenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the exercise of its corporate powers and functions and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The Authority may provide by the trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues to the trustee under the trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the Authority.\n\n(8) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(9) In case any of the commissioners or officers of the Authority whose signatures appear on any notes or bonds or coupons shall cease to be commissioners or officers before the delivery of the notes or bonds, the signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the commissioners or officers had remained in office until delivery.\n\n(10) The Authority may exercise in connection with the issuance of any of its obligations, including notes, bonds, bond anticipation notes and refunding notes or bonds, all or any part or combination of the powers granted herein or in Section 31-3-1580, and may make convenants other than and in addition to the covenants herein and therein expressly authorized, of like or different character and make such covenants and do any and all such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to secure its notes or bonds or, in the absolute discretion of the Authority, as will tend to make the notes or bonds more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein or in Section 31-3-1580.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in the first sentence of subsection (1) of this section, any earnings, fees or charges derived by the Authority from any of the programs authorized by items (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) not required by the proceedings pursuant to which notes or bonds were issued to be used for the payment of such notes or bonds or for any reserves required therefor are to be used by the Authority for any of its corporate purposes including the promotion of any program which the Authority is authorized to undertake.\n\nHISTORY: 1977 Act No. 76, Section 5; 1983 Act No. 31, Sections 1-4; 1988 Act No. 538, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 370, Section 1; 2005 Act No. 110, Section 2.\n\nCode Commissioners Note\n\nThe Code Commissioner changed the reference in item (2) from Section 11-9-350 to Section 11-9-360.",
