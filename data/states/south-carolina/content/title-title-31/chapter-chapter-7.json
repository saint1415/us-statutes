      "text": "(A) The General Assembly finds that:\n\n(1) Section 14(10) of Article X of the Constitution of South Carolina provides that the General Assembly may authorize by general law that indebtedness for the purpose of redevelopment within counties may be incurred and that the debt service of such indebtedness be provided from the added increments of tax revenues to result from the project.\n\n(2) An increasing demand for public services must be provided from a limited tax base. Incentives must be provided for redevelopment in areas which are, or threaten to become, predominantly slum or blighted.\n\n(3) There exist in many counties of this State blighted, conservation, and sprawl areas; the sprawl and conservation areas are rapidly deteriorating and declining and may soon become blighted areas if their decline is not checked; the stable economic and physical development of the blighted areas, conservation areas, and sprawl areas are endangered by the presence of blighting factors as manifested by progressive and advanced deterioration of structures, by the overuse of housing and other facilities, by a lack of physical maintenance of existing structures, by obsolete and inadequate community facilities, and a lack of sound community planning, by obsolete platting, diversity of ownership, excessive tax, and special assessment delinquencies, or by a combination of these and other factors; that as a result of the existence of blighted areas, areas requiring conservation, and sprawl areas, there is an excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds, inadequate public and private investment, unmarketability of property, growth in delinquencies and crime, and substandard housing conditions and zoning law violations in such areas together with an abnormal exodus of families and businesses so that the decline of these areas impairs the value of private investments and threatens the sound growth and the tax base of taxing districts in such areas, and threatens the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public.\n\n(4) In order to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public, blighted conditions need to be eradicated and conservation measures instituted, sprawl areas controlled, and redevelopment of such areas undertaken; to remove and alleviate adverse conditions it is necessary to encourage private investment and restore and enhance the tax base of the taxing districts in such areas by the redevelopment of project areas. The eradication of blighted areas and treatment and improvement of sprawl areas and conservation areas by redevelopment projects is declared to be essential to the public interest.\n\n(5) The use of incremental tax revenues derived from the tax rates of various taxing districts in redevelopment project areas for the payment of redevelopment project costs is of benefit to the taxing districts because taxing districts located in redevelopment project areas would not derive the benefits of an increased assessment base without the benefits of tax increment financing, all surplus tax revenues are turned over to the taxing districts in redevelopment project areas, and all taxing districts benefit from the removal of blighted conditions, the eradication of conditions requiring conservation measures, and control of sprawl conditions.\n\n(B) The General Assembly intends to implement the authorization granted in Article X, Section 14 of the Constitution of this State. The authorization in this chapter provides for this State an essential method for financing redevelopment. The governing bodies of the counties are vested with all powers consistent with the Constitution necessary, useful, and desirable to enable them to accomplish redevelopment in areas which are or threaten to become blighted and to sufficiently meet all constitutional requirements pertaining to incurring indebtedness for the purpose of redevelopment and funding the debt service of such indebtedness from the added increment of tax revenues to result from such redevelopment as provided in Section 14(10) of Article X of the Constitution of this State. The indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 14(10) of Article X of the Constitution is exempt from all debt limitations imposed by Article X. The powers granted in this chapter must be in all respects exercised for the benefit of the inhabitants of the State, for the increase of its commerce, and for the promotion of its welfare and prosperity.\n\n(C) All action taken by any county in carrying out the purposes of this chapter shall perform essential governmental functions.\n\n(D) Pursuant to the authorization granted in Article VIII, Section 13, of the Constitution of this State, if a redevelopment project area is located in more than one county, the powers granted herein may be exercised jointly.\n\nHISTORY: 1999 Act No. 109, Section 1; 2005 Act No. 109, Section 2.",

Each redevelopment plan shall set forth in writing the program to be undertaken to accomplish the objectives and shall include, but not be limited to, estimated redevelopment project costs including long-term project maintenance, as applicable, the anticipated sources of funds to pay costs, the nature and term of any obligations to be issued, the most recent equalized assessed valuation of the project area, an estimate as to the equalized assessed valuation after redevelopment, and the general land uses to apply in the redevelopment project area. A redevelopment plan established by Chapter 10 of Title 31 is deemed a redevelopment plan for purposes of this paragraph.\n\n(7) \"Redevelopment project\" means any buildings, improvements, including street, road, and highway improvements, water, sewer and storm drainage facilities, parking facilities, tourism and recreation-related facilities, energy production or transmission infrastructure, communications technology, and public transportation infrastructure including, but not limited to, rail and airport facilities.

A redevelopment project for purposes of this chapter also includes affordable housing projects where all or a part of new property tax revenues generated in the tax increment financing district are used to provide or support publicly owned affordable housing in the district or is used to provide infrastructure projects to support privately owned affordable housing in the district. The term \"affordable housing\" as used herein means residential housing for rent or sale that is appropriately priced for rent or sale to a person or family whose income does not exceed eighty percent of the median income for the local area, with adjustments for household size, according to the latest figures available from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\n(8) \"Redevelopment project area\" means an area designated by the county, which is not less in the aggregate than one and one-half acres and in respect to which the county has made a finding that there exist conditions that cause the area to be classified as a blighted area, a conservation area, or a sprawl area, or a combination of two or three of them. The total aggregate amount of all redevelopment project areas of any one county may not exceed five percent of the total acreage of the county but this limit does not apply with respect to these parts of a redevelopment project area comprised of a conservation area or a RRZ sprawl area.\n\n(9) \"Redevelopment project costs\" means and includes the sum total of all reasonable or necessary costs incurred or estimated to be incurred and any costs incidental to a redevelopment project.

In the ordinance the county may pledge all or any part of the funds in and to be deposited in the special tax allocation fund created pursuant to Section 31-7-70 to the payment of the redevelopment project costs and obligations. Any pledge of funds in the special tax allocation fund must provide for distribution to the taxing districts of monies not required for payment and securing of the obligations and the excess funds are surplus funds. In the event a county only pledges a portion of the monies in the special tax allocation fund for the payment of redevelopment project costs or obligations, any funds remaining in the special tax allocation fund after complying with the requirements of the pledge are also considered surplus funds.
