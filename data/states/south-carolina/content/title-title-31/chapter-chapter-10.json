Prior to the public sale of bonds hereunder, the commission shall first cause a notice of the sale of the bonds to be published at least once at least ten days before the date fixed for the receipt of bids for the bonds in a newspaper of general circulation in the commission's area of operation, and provided, that any bonds may be sold by the commission at private sale upon such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon between the commission and the purchaser. No bonds issued pursuant to this chapter may be sold at less than par and accrued interest.\n\n(e) In case any of the commissioners or officers of the commission whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures are, nevertheless, valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery. Any provisions of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter are fully negotiable unless specified to the contrary by the commission.\n\n(f) In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond of the commission or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the commission to aid in financing a redevelopment project, as defined by this chapter is conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project is conclusively deemed to have been planned, located, and carried out in accordance with the purposes and provisions of this chapter.\n\n(g) Bonds (including, without limitation, interim and long-term notes) may be issued or sold under this chapter at private sale upon such terms and conditions as may be negotiated and mutually agreed upon by the commission and the purchaser who may be the government or other public or private lender.\n\nHISTORY: 1984 Act No. 451, Section 13; 1987 Act No. 2, Section 1.",
