A noncharitable irrevocable trust may be modified upon consent of all of the beneficiaries if the court concludes that modification is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust.\n\n(c) Upon termination of a trust under subsection (a) or (b), the trustee shall distribute the trust property as ordered by the court.\n\n(d) If not all of the beneficiaries consent to a proposed modification or termination of the trust under subsection (a) or (b), the modification or termination may be approved by the court if the court is satisfied that:\n\n(1) if all of the beneficiaries had consented, the trust could have been modified or terminated under this section; and\n\n(2) the interests of a beneficiary who does not consent will be adequately protected.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
