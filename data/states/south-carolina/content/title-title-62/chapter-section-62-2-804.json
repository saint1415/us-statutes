This presumption does not apply to property:\n\n(1) acquired by either spouse before marriage;\n\n(2) acquired by either spouse by gift or inheritance during the marriage;\n\n(3) used by the decedent spouse in a trade or business in which the surviving spouse has no interest;\n\n(4) held for another; or\n\n(5) specifically devised in a will or devised in a written statement or list disposing of tangible personal property pursuant to Section 62-2-512.\n\n(B) The presumption created in this section may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence demonstrating that ownership was held other than in joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nHISTORY: 2010 Act No. 266, Section 2, eff June 24, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
