A person concerned for the welfare of the animal may request the court to appoint a person to enforce the trust or to remove a person appointed.\n\n(c) Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use.
