      "text": "(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, on death of a party sums on deposit in a multiple-party account belong to the surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 belongs to the surviving spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares, and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201, and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.\n\n(b) In an account with a POD designation:\n\n(1) on death of one of two or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed by subsection (a);\n\n(2) on death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. If two or more beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares, and there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary thereafter. If no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to the estate of the last surviving party.\n\n(c) Sums on deposit in a single-party account without a POD designation, or in a multiple-party account that, by the terms of the account, is without right of survivorship, are not affected by death of a party, but the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate. A POD designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship.\n\n(d) The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary, or of the decedent's estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial institution before or after death, or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent's estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section, to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 70; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 88; 1976 Code Section 62-6-104; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.",

      "text": "(a) Rights at death of a party under Section 62-6-202 are determined by the terms of the account at the death of the party. A party may alter the terms of the account by a notice signed by the party and given to the financial institution to change the terms of the account or to stop or vary payment under the terms of the account. To be effective the notice must be received by the financial institution during the party's lifetime.\n\n(b) A right of survivorship arising from the express terms of the account under Section 62-6-202 may be altered by clear and convincing evidence, including but not limited to express provisions in a will.\n\n(c) A multiple-party account of husband and wife is presumed to be joint with right of survivorship unless clear and convincing evidence shows survivorship was not the intent of the party.\n\nHISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
