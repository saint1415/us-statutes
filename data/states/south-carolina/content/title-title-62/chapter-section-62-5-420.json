The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in Section 62-5-404 or Section 62-5-428 are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator. This protection extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. This protection is not a substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1.
