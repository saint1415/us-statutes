If the net aggregate amount to be paid or delivered in a given year exceeds fifteen thousand dollars, a protective proceeding is required. If the person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor or incapacitated person does not have actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed or that appointment of a conservator is pending, the person may pay or deliver the money or property in amounts not exceeding a net aggregate of fifteen thousand dollars each year to: (1) a person having the care and custody of the minor or incapacitated individual with whom the minor or incapacitated individual resides; (2) a guardian of the minor or an incapacitated individual; or (3) a financial institution incident to a deposit in a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor or for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act and giving notice of the deposit to the minor.

      "text": "(A) The process for emergency orders without notice is as follows: (1) Emergency orders without notice must not be issued unless the moving party files a summons, verified petition, notice of and motion for emergency relief and hearing with any available supporting affidavit(s), and any other document required by the court. The verified petition, motion, and affidavits shall set forth specific facts supporting the allegation that an immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be served on adverse parties and a hearing held pursuant to subsection (B). (a) If emergency relief is requested, the moving party must present evidence of the emergency and of the individual's incapacity to the court's satisfaction including, but not limited to, an affidavit from a physician or nurse practitioner, or at the discretion of the court, a physician assistant or psychologist, who has performed an examination within thirty days prior to the filing of the action. Additionally, the moving party shall file a motion for the appointment of counsel if counsel has not been retained for an alleged incapacitated individual, and a motion for the appointment of a guardian ad litem. (b) If the emergency relief requested is an order for: (i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or (ii) the removal of an existing guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, then the moving party must submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary. (2) If the motion for emergency relief is not granted, the moving party may seek temporary relief after notice pursuant to subsection (B) or proceed to a final hearing. The court may, in its discretion, treat a motion for emergency relief as a motion for temporary relief as set forth in subsection (B). (3) If the motion for an emergency relief is granted, the date and hour of its issuance must be endorsed on the order. The date and time for the emergency hearing must be entered on the notice of hearing and it must be no later than ten days from the date of the order or as the court determines is reasonable for good cause shown. (4) The moving party shall serve all pleadings on the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person, counsel for the alleged incapacitated individual, guardian ad litem, and other adverse parties immediately after issuance of the emergency order. (5) If the moving party does not appear at the emergency hearing, the court may dissolve the emergency order without notice. (6) Evidence admitted at the hearing may be limited to verified pleadings and any supporting affidavits. Upon good cause shown or at the court's direction, additional evidence of incapacity and the nature of the emergency may be admitted. (7) On two days' notice to the party who obtained the emergency order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, an adverse party may appear and move for the emergency order's dissolution or modification, and in that event, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the motion as expeditiously as possible and may consolidate motions. (8) No emergency order for conservatorship must be issued except upon the court receiving adequate assurances the assets will be protected, which may include providing of security by the moving party in a sum the court deems proper for costs and damages incurred by any party who without just cause is aggrieved as a result of the emergency order. A surety upon a bond or undertaking submits to the jurisdiction of the court. (9) The court may take whatever actions it deems necessary to protect assets including, but not limited to, issuing an order to freeze accounts. (10) Upon the hearing on the ex parte order, if the court continues its prior emergency order, the order must be for a duration of no more than six months unless otherwise specified in an order. A hearing held for the purpose of the issuance of a final order shall be de novo as to all issues. (11) In an emergency, the court may exercise the power of a guardian with or without notice if the court makes emergency findings as required by the Adult Health Care Consent Act, Section 44-66-30. (B) The process for temporary orders and temporary hearings with notice is as follows: (1) A temporary order must not be issued without proof of service on a notice of hearing to the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person, counsel for the alleged incapacitated individual, the guardian ad litem, and other parties. (2) A temporary hearing may be scheduled upon the filing of the summons, motion for temporary hearing with any supporting affidavits, a verified petition, and motions for the appointment of counsel and guardian ad litem if none have been previously appointed or retained. The temporary hearing may not be held fewer than ten days from service on all interested parties or as the court determines is reasonable. (a) If temporary relief is requested, the moving party shall present evidence of the need for temporary relief and of incapacity, including without limitation, an affidavit from a physician or nurse practitioner or, at the discretion of the court, a physician assistant or psychologist, who has performed an examination within the previous forty-five days. (b) If the temporary relief requested is an order for: (i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or (ii) removal of an existing guardian, conservator or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, in addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (B)(2) and (a), as applicable, the moving party shall submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary. (3) If the motion for temporary relief is not granted, the action will remain on the court docket for a de novo hearing on the underlying petition. (4) If the court determines that the motion for temporary relief should be set for a hearing, the court shall enter a date and time for the temporary hearing on the notice of hearing. (5) Temporary orders resulting from the hearing shall expire six months from the date of issuance unless otherwise specified in an order. (C) After preliminary hearing upon such notice as the court deems reasonable, and if the petition requests temporary relief, the court has the power to preserve and apply the property of the alleged incapacitated individual as may be required for his benefit or the benefit of his dependents. Notice of the court's actions shall be given to interested parties as soon thereafter as possible. (D) A hearing concerning the need for a protective order or the appointment of a permanent guardian or conservator must be a hearing de novo as to all issues before the court.

(B) When acting as conservator or when approving a conservator's or special conservator's action, the court may consider the: (1) wishes of the protected person; (2) financial needs and legal obligations of the protected person and those who are dependent upon him for support; (3) tax consequences; (4) protected person's eligibility or potential eligibility for governmental assistance; (5) protected person's previous pattern of giving or level of support; (6) protected person's gifting and estate plan; and (7) protected person's life expectancy and the probable duration of incapacity.

(3) The conservator shall consider: (a) the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage his affairs and the estate that has been conserved for him; (b) the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of his household; and (c) other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person. (4) Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person, as reimbursement for expenditures or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances. (5) If the conservator determines that it is reasonably necessary to supply funds to the protected person, the conservator may provide these funds to the protected person through reasonable financial methods, including, but not limited to, checks, currency, debit card, or allowance. All funds so provided must be reported on the accountings as required by the court. (B) After paying outstanding expenses of administration and any claims approved by the court, after meeting the requirements of Section 62-5-416, and after complying with any additional requirements established by the court, the conservator shall pay over and distribute all remaining funds and properties as follows: (1) when a person who is incapacitated solely by reason of minority attains the age of eighteen or is emancipated by a court order, to the now-adult or emancipated protected person as soon as practical, unless a: (a) protective order has been issued because the protected person is incapacitated; or (b) protective proceeding or other petition with regard to the protected person is pending; a protected person under the age of eighteen who is married shall remain a minor for purposes of this subsection until attaining the age of eighteen or being emancipated by court order; (2) upon an adjudication restoring capacity, to the former protected person as soon as practical; (3) upon a determination by the court that the protected person's estate has a net aggregate amount of less than fifteen thousand dollars to or for the protected person as soon as practical pursuant to Section 62-5-103; or (4) if a protected person dies, to the protected person's duly appointed personal representative or as ordered by the court.

      "text": "(A) The probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the protected person arising from the internal affairs of the conservatorship which may be commenced in the following manner: (1) A claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed. The claimant also must file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the probate court in which the conservatorship is under administration. (2) A claim is considered presented upon the filing of the statement of claim with the court. (3) As to claims presented in the manner described in item (1), within sixty days after the presentment of the claim, the conservator must serve upon the claimant a notice stating the claim has been allowed or disallowed in whole or in part. Service of such notice shall be by United States mail, personal service, or otherwise as permitted by rule, and a copy of the notice must be filed with the probate court, along with proof of delivery setting forth the date of mailing or other service on the claimant. A notice of disallowance or partial disallowance of a claim must contain a warning that the claim will be barred to the extent disallowed unless the claimant commences a proceeding for allowance of the claim in accordance with item (4) within thirty days of the mailing or other service of the notice of disallowance or partial disallowance. Every claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the conservator is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant commences a proceeding for allowance of the claim in accordance with item (4) no later than thirty days after the mailing or other service of the notice of disallowance or partial disallowance by the conservator. For good cause shown, the court may reasonably extend the time for filing the notice of allowance or disallowance of a properly filed claim. (4) Once a claim is presented in accordance with item (1), a claimant may at any time thereafter commence a legal proceeding against the conservator by the filing of a summons and petition for allowance of a claim in the probate court having jurisdiction over the conservatorship, seeking payment of the claim by the conservatorship, and serving the same upon the conservator. Thereafter, the probate court shall not authorize the termination of the conservatorship until the legal proceeding has ended. (5) In lieu of the procedure provided for in items (1) through (4), a claimant may commence a legal proceeding against the conservator, by the filing of a summons and petition for allowance of a claim or complaint in the probate court having jurisdiction over the conservatorship, seeking payment of his claim by the conservatorship, and serving the same upon the conservator. Thereafter, the probate court may not permit the termination of the conservatorship until the legal proceeding has ended. (6) Notwithstanding another provision of this section, no proceeding for enforcement or allowance of a claim may be commenced more than thirty days after the conservator has mailed a notice of disallowance or partial disallowance of the claim. (7) This subsection does not apply to a proceeding by a secured creditor to enforce the secured creditor's right to its security. (B) Except as limited by Section 62-5-433, the probate court has jurisdiction concurrent with the circuit court in matters involving a request for a judicial determination as to the external affairs of a conservatorship, including actions by or against creditors or debtors of conservatorships and other actions or proceedings involving conservators and third parties. If a creditor has notice of the appointment of a conservator, all pleadings must be served by or on the conservator. Within thirty days after the conservator files, or becomes aware of, any court action in which the protected person is a party, the conservator must notify the court where the conservatorship is being administered if the outcome may constitute a claim against the estate. The conservator may request instructions from the court as necessary. (C) If it appears that the conservatorship assets are likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference must be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or his dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

(2) The court may approve or deny the application without notice, require notice to such persons as the court directs, or may require the commencement of a formal proceeding pursuant to Section 62-5-428(B). (3) If the court determines that the protected person's estate has a net aggregate amount of less than fifteen thousand dollars, the court may in its discretion, terminate the conservatorship. (4) If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person which may have come into the conservator's possession, inform the personal representative or a beneficiary named in the will of the delivery, and retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the deceased protected person or other persons entitled to delivery. If, after thirty days from the death of the protected person, no person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is pending in the court, the conservator may apply for appointment as personal representative. A person must not be disqualified as a personal representative of a deceased protected person solely by reason of his having been appointed or acting as conservator for that protected person. (B)(1) Upon filing of a summons and petition with the appointing court, the protected person, the conservator, or interested person may request an order: (a) terminating a conservatorship; (b) requiring distributions from the protected person's estate after the conservator has denied the request; (c) upon the death of a conservator, appointing a successor conservator, if necessary; (d) limiting or expanding the conservatorship; (e) authorizing a transaction involving a conflict of interest pursuant to Section 62-5-419; (f) reviewing the denial of an application pursuant to Section 62-5-422(C); or (g) granting other appropriate relief. (2) The procedure for obtaining orders subsequent to appointment is as follows: (a) The summons and petition shall state the relief sought and the reasons the relief is necessary and must be served upon the protected person; the conservator; the guardian, if any; the spouse; adult children; and parents of the protected person whose whereabouts are reasonably ascertainable; and, if there is no spouse, adult child, or parent, any person who has equal or greater priority for appointment; any person with whom the protected person resides outside of a health care facility, group home, homeless shelter, or prison; and the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs if the conservatorship is for the purpose of receiving veterans benefits. (b) After filing and service of the summons and petition, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem and may appoint counsel for the protected person, unless the protected person has private counsel, and such examiners as are needed to evaluate and confirm the allegations of the petition. (c) As soon as the interests of justice may allow, but after the time for response to the petition has elapsed as to all parties served, the court may hold a hearing on the merits of the petition or may follow the procedure for a consent order without a hearing outlined in Section 62-5-403C. The protected person and all parties not in default must be given notice of the hearing. If all parties not in default waive a hearing, the court may issue a consent order. (d) The court may issue interim orders, for a period not to exceed ninety days, until a hearing is held and a final order is issued. (C) The court may specify a minimum period, not exceeding one year, during which no application or petition for readjudication may be filed without leave of court. Subject to this restriction, the protected person or the conservator may petition the court for a termination of incapacity or of the protective order, which must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. (D) An attorney who has been asked by the protected person to represent him in an action under this section may file a motion with the court for permission to represent the protected person.

The court shall treat this as the filing of authenticated or certified records and shall charge fees set forth in Section 8-21-770 for the filing of these documents.

      "text": "(A) For purposes of this section: (1) \"Estate\" and \"income\" include only monies received from the VA, all real and personal property acquired in whole or in part with these monies, and all earnings, interest, and profits. (2) \"Benefits\" means all monies payable by the United States through the VA. (3) \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or his successor. (4) \"Protected person\" means a beneficiary of the VA. (5) \"Conservator\" has the same meaning as provided in Section 62-1-201 but only as to benefits from the VA. (B) Whenever, pursuant to a law of the United States or regulation of the VA, the Secretary requires that a conservator be appointed for a protected person before payment of benefits, the appointment must be made in the manner provided in this part, except to the extent this section requires otherwise. The petition shall show that the person to be protected has been rated incapable of handling his estate and monies on examination by the VA in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the VA. (C) When a petition is filed for the appointment of a conservator and a certificate of the secretary or his representative is filed setting forth the fact that the appointment of a conservator is a condition precedent to the payment of benefits due the protected person by the VA, the certificate is prima facie evidence of the necessity for the appointment and no examiner's report is required. (D) Except as provided or as otherwise permitted by the VA, a person may not serve as conservator of a protected person if the proposed conservator at that time is acting simultaneously as conservator for five protected persons. Upon presentation of a petition by an attorney for the VA alleging that a person is serving simultaneously as a conservator for more than five protected persons and requesting that person's termination as a conservator for that reason, upon proof substantiating the petition, the court shall restrain that person from acting as a conservator for the affected protected person and shall require a final accounting from the conservator. After the appointment of a successor conservator if one is warranted under the circumstances, the court shall terminate the appointment of the person as conservator in all requested cases. The limitations of this section do not apply when the conservator is a bank or trust company. (E) The conservator shall file an inventory, accountings, exhibits or other pleadings with the court and with the VA as provided by law or VA regulation. The conservator is required to furnish the inventory and accountings to the VA. (F) Every conservator shall invest the surplus funds in his protected person's estate in securities, or otherwise, as allowed by law, and in which the conservator has no interest. These funds may be invested, without prior court authorization, in direct interest-bearing obligations of this State or of the United States and in obligations in which the interest and principal are both unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government. (G) Whenever a copy of a public record is required by the VA to be used in determining the eligibility of a person to participate in benefits made available by the VA, the official charged with the custody of the public record shall provide a certified copy of the record, without charge, to an applicant for the benefits, a person acting on his behalf, or a representative of the VA. (H) With regard to a minor or a mentally incompetent person to whom, or on whose behalf, benefits have been paid or are payable by the VA, the secretary is and must be a necessary party in a: (1) proceeding brought for the appointment, confirmation, recognition, or removal of a conservator; (2) suit or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, arising out of the administration of the person's estate; and (3) proceeding which is for the removal of the disability of minority or of mental incompetency of the person. (I) In a case or proceeding involving property or funds of a protected person not derived from the VA, the VA is not a necessary party, but may be an interested party in the proceedings. (J) For services as conservator of funds paid from the VA, a conservator may be paid an amount not to exceed five percent of the income of the protected person during any year. If extraordinary services are rendered by a conservator, the court may, upon application of the conservator and notice to the VA, authorize additional compensation payable from the estate of the protected person. No compensation is allowed on the corpus of an estate derived from payments from the VA. The conservator may be allowed reimbursement from the estate of the protected person for reasonable premiums paid to a corporate surety upon the bond furnished by the conservator.

For purposes of this section and for any claim not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars in favor of or against any minor or incapacitated individual, \"court\" means either the circuit court or the probate court of the county in which the minor or incapacitated individual resides or the circuit court or probate court in the county in which the suit is pending. (2) \"Claim\" means the net or actual amount accruing to or paid by the minor or incapacitated individual as a result of the settlement. (3) \"Petitioner\" means either a conservator appointed by the court for the minor or incapacitated individual or the guardian or guardian ad litem of the minor or incapacitated individual if a conservator has not been appointed. (4) \"Guardian ad litem\" means a person who has been appointed by the court as provided in Rule 17, South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and not a person appointed pursuant to Section 62-5-303B or Section 62-5-403B. (B) The settlement of a claim over twenty-five thousand dollars in favor of or against a minor or incapacitated individual for the payment of money or the possession of personal property must be effected on his behalf in the following manner: (1) The petitioner must file with the court a verified petition setting forth all of the pertinent facts concerning the claim, payment, attorney's fees, and expenses, if any, and the reasons why, in the opinion of the petitioner, the proposed settlement should be approved. For all claims that exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, the verified petition must include a statement by the petitioner that, in his opinion, the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the minor or incapacitated individual. (2) If, upon consideration of the petition and after hearing the testimony as it may require concerning the matter, the court concludes that the proposed settlement is proper and in the best interests of the minor or incapacitated individual, the court shall issue its order approving the settlement and authorizing the petitioner to consummate it and, if the settlement requires the payment of money or the delivery of personal property for the benefit of the minor or incapacitated individual, to receive the money or personal property and execute a proper receipt and release or covenant not to sue therefor, which is binding upon the minor or incapacitated individual. (3) The order authorizing the settlement must require that payment or delivery of the money or personal property be made through the conservator or pursuant to a protective order issued by the probate court. If a conservator has not been appointed nor a protective order issued, the petitioner, upon receiving the money or personal property, shall pay and deliver it to the court pending the appointment and qualification of a duly-qualified conservator or the issuance of a protective order. If a party subject to the court order fails or refuses to pay the money or deliver the personal property as required by the order, he is liable and punishable as for contempt of court, but failure or refusal does not affect the validity or conclusiveness of the settlement. (C) The settlement of a claim that does not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars in favor of or against a minor or incapacitated individual for the payment of money or the possession of personal property may be effected in any of the following manners: (1) If a conservator has been appointed, he may settle the claim without court authorization or confirmation, as provided in Section 62-5-422, or he may petition the court for approval, as provided in items (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (B). If the settlement requires the payment of money or the delivery of personal property for the benefit of the minor or incapacitated individual, the conservator shall receive the money or personal property and execute a proper receipt and release or covenant not to sue therefor, which is binding upon the minor or incapacitated individual. (2) If a conservator has not been appointed, the guardian or guardian ad litem must petition the court for approval of the settlement, as provided in items (1) and (2) of subsection (B), and without the appointment of a conservator. The payment or delivery of money or personal property to or for a minor or incapacitated individual must be made in accordance with Section 62-5-103. If a party subject to the court order fails or refuses to pay the money or deliver the personal property, as required by the order and in accordance with Section 62-5-103, he is liable and punishable as for contempt of court, but failure or refusal does not affect the validity or conclusiveness of the settlement. (D) The settlement of a claim that does not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars in favor of or against a minor or incapacitated individual for the payment of money or the possession of personal property may be effected by the parent or guardian of the minor or incapacitated individual without court approval of the settlement and without the appointment of a conservator. If the settlement requires the payment of money or the delivery of personal property for the benefit of the minor or incapacitated individual, the parent or guardian shall receive the money or personal property and execute a proper receipt and release or covenant not to sue therefor, which is binding upon the minor or incapacitated individual. The payment or delivery of money or personal property to or for a minor or incapacitated individual must be made in accordance with Section 62-5-103.

Statutory provisions that refer to a durable power of attorney or judicial interpretations of the law relating to durable powers of attorney apply to a health care power of attorney to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this part. (b) This section does not affect the right of a person to execute a durable power of attorney relating to health care pursuant to other provisions of law but which does not conform to the requirements of this section. If a durable power of attorney for health care executed under this part or under the laws of another state does not conform to the requirements of this section, the provisions of this section do not apply to it. However, a court is not precluded from determining that the law applicable to nonconforming durable powers of attorney for health care is the same as the law set forth in this section for health care powers of attorney. (c) To the extent not inconsistent with this part, the provisions of the Adult Health Care Consent Act apply to the making of decisions by a health care agent and the implementation of those decisions by health care providers. (d) In determining the effectiveness of a health care power of attorney, mental incompetence is to be determined according to the standards and procedures for inability to consent pursuant to Section 44-66-20(8), except that certification of mental incompetence by the agent may be substituted for certification by a second physician. If the certifying physician states that the principal's mental incompetence precludes the principal from making all health care decisions or all decisions concerning certain categories of health care, and that the principal's mental incompetence is permanent or of extended duration, no further certification is necessary in regard to the stated categories of health care decisions during the stated duration of mental incompetence unless the agent or the attending physician believes the principal may have regained capacity.
