Proper execution may be established by other evidence, including an affidavit of an attesting witness. An attestation clause that is signed by the attesting witnesses raises a rebuttable presumption that the events recited in the clause occurred.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 22; 1988 Act No. 659, Section 16; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
