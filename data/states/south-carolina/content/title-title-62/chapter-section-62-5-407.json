With respect to persons having equal priority, the court shall select the person it considers best qualified to serve as conservator. The court, acting in the best interest of the alleged incapacitated individual, may decline to appoint a person having higher priority and appoint a person having lesser priority or no priority.\n\n(C) Except when authorizing, directing, or ratifying the implementations of provisions of protective arrangements, pursuant to Section 62-5-405, a probate judge or an employee of the court shall not serve as a conservator of an estate of a protected person; except, a probate judge or an employee of the court may serve as a conservator of the estate of a family member if such service does not interfere with the proper performance of the probate judge's or the employee's official duties. For purposes of this subsection, \"family member\" means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1995 Act No. 15, Section 4.
