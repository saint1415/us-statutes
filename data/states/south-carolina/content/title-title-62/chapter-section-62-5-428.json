If, after thirty days from the death of the protected person, no person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is pending in the court, the conservator may apply for appointment as personal representative.

The protected person and all parties not in default must be given notice of the hearing. If all parties not in default waive a hearing, the court may issue a consent order.\n\n(d) The court may issue interim orders, for a period not to exceed ninety days, until a hearing is held and a final order is issued.\n\n(C) The court may specify a minimum period, not exceeding one year, during which no application or petition for readjudication may be filed without leave of court. Subject to this restriction, the protected person or the conservator may petition the court for a termination of incapacity or of the protective order, which must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(D) An attorney who has been asked by the protected person to represent him in an action under this section may file a motion with the court for permission to represent the protected person.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2008 Act No. 303, Section 1, eff June 11, 2008; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 36, 39, eff June 7, 2010.
