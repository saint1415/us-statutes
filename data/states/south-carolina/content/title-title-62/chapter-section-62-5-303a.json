Unless the guardian ad litem or the alleged incapacitated individual objects, if a physician's or nurse practitioner's notarized report or, at the discretion of the court, or the report of a physician assistant or psychologist is filed with the petition and served upon the alleged incapacitated individual and all interested parties with the petition, then the court may appoint such physician as the examiner. Upon the court's own motion or upon request of the initial examiner, the alleged incapacitated individual, or his guardian ad litem, the court may appoint a second examiner, who must be a physician, physician assistant, nurse, nurse practitioner, social worker, or psychologist.\n\n(B) At any time during the proceeding, if requested by a guardian ad litem who is not an attorney, the court may appoint counsel for the guardian ad litem.\n\n(C) At the attorney's discretion, the attorney for the alleged incapacitated individual may file a motion requesting that the court relieve him as the attorney if the alleged incapacitated individual is incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences regarding the appointment of a guardian. The attorney must file an affidavit in support of the motion. If the court is satisfied that the alleged incapacitated individual is incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences regarding the appointment of a guardian, then the court may relieve the attorney from his duties as attorney for the alleged incapacitated individual. If the former attorney requests to be appointed as the guardian ad litem, the court may appoint him to serve as the guardian ad litem. An attorney cannot serve as both an attorney and as a guardian ad litem in a guardianship action.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 25, eff June 7, 2010.
