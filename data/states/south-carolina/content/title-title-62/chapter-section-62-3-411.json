If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and search was made, he may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative. In addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decedent may recover any estate or its proceeds from distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 41; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
