If a creditor has notice of the appointment of a conservator, all pleadings must be served by or on the conservator. Within thirty days after the conservator files, or becomes aware of, any court action in which the protected person is a party, the conservator must notify the court where the conservatorship is being administered if the outcome may constitute a claim against the estate. The conservator may request instructions from the court as necessary.\n\n(C) If it appears that the conservatorship assets are likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference must be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or his dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 659, Section 6; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 26; 2010 Act No. 244, Sections 31, 38, eff June 7, 2010.
