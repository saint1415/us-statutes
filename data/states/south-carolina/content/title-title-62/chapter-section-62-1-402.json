If there is no conflict of interest and no conservator or guardian has been appointed, a person may represent his minor or unborn issue.\n\n(iii) A minor or unborn or unascertained person who is not otherwise represented is bound by an order to the extent his interest is adequately represented by another party having a substantially identical interest in the proceeding.\n\n(3) Service of summons, petition, and notice is required as follows:\n\n(i) Service of summons, petition, and notice must be given to every interested person or to one who can bind an interested person as described in (2)(i) or (2)(ii) above. Service of summons and petition upon, as well as notice, may be given both to a person and to another who may bind him.\n\n(ii) Service upon and notice is given to unborn or unascertained persons who are not represented under (2)(i) or (2)(ii) above by giving notice to all known persons whose interests in the proceedings are substantially identical to those of the unborn or unascertained persons.\n\n(4) At any point in a proceeding, a court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of a minor, an incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained person, or a person whose identity or address is unknown, if the court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate. If not precluded by conflict of interests, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests. The court shall set out its reasons for appointing a guardian ad litem as a part of the record of the proceeding.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 5; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 4, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
