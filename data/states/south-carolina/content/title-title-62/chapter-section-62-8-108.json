      "text": "(a) Except as provided in subsection (c), a power of attorney is effective when executed pursuant to Sections 62-8-105 and 62-8-106 unless the principal provides in the power of attorney that it becomes effective at a future date or upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency.\n\n(1) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency, the principal, in the power of attorney, may authorize one or more persons to determine in a writing or other record that the event or contingency has occurred.\n\n(2) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal's incapacity and the principal has not authorized a person to determine whether the principal is incapacitated, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the power of attorney becomes effective upon a determination in a writing or other record by:\n\n(A) a physician or licensed psychologist that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of Section 62-8-102(5)(A); or\n\n(B) attorney at law, court of competent jurisdiction, or an appropriate governmental official that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of Section 62-8-102(5)(B).\n\n(b) A person authorized by the principal in the power of attorney to determine that the principal is incapacitated may act as the principal's personal representative pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Sections 1171 through 1179 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320d, as amended, and applicable regulations, to obtain access to the principal's health care information and communicate with the principal's health care provider.\n\n(c) After the principal's incapacity, an agent may exercise the authority granted unto the agent under the power of attorney only if the power of attorney has been recorded in the same manner as a deed in the county where the principal resides at the time the instrument is recorded. If the principal resides out of State, the power of attorney may be recorded in any county where property of the principal is located at the time the instrument is recorded. The power of attorney may be recorded before or after the principal's incapacity. After the principal's incapacity and before recordation, the agent's authority cannot be exercised.\n\n(d) An agent may exercise a power of attorney executed in another jurisdiction if its execution complies with Section 62-8-106 if, after the principal's incapacity, it is recorded as required in subsection (c). Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 30-5-30, a valid power of attorney as provided for pursuant to this part, which is executed in another jurisdiction, may be recorded as though it complies with the provisions of Section 30-5-30.\n\nHISTORY: 2016 Act No. 279 (S.778), Section 1, eff January 1, 2017.",
