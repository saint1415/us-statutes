      "text": "The time to answer a summons and petition for sale of real property of a decedent is the same as the time to answer in any civil litigation case. Interested persons who wish to file an answer or return to the petition must do so in writing in the same manner as an answer to a complaint in other civil litigation cases. In addition the court may hear motions and accept such subsequent pleadings as would be heard or accepted in other civil litigation cases. After the filing and service of the summons and petition and the time for filing responsive pleadings has elapsed, the court will convene a hearing on the merits of the petition. If based on the evidence presented at the hearing the court finds the real property should be sold it shall then, in its discretion, either (a) order the personal representative to sell the same at private sale upon such terms and conditions as the court may impose; or (b) proceed to sell the same upon the next or some subsequent convenient sales day after publishing a notice of such sale three weeks prior thereto in some paper published in the county. Upon the sale being made, after the payment of the costs and expenses thereof, the proceeds of the sale will be paid over to the personal representative. The personal representative shall administer such proceeds in like manner as proceeds of personal property coming into his hands. Nothing in this part may be construed to abridge homestead exemptions. Notice of hearings in regard to the petition will be provided to interested persons in accordance with Section 62-1-401.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 59; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 77; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 23, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
