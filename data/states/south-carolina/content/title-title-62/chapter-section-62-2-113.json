If the court makes such a determination as to a parent or parents, the parent shall be a disqualified parent. The proceeds, or portion of the proceeds, that a disqualified parent would have taken shall pass as though the disqualified parent had predeceased the decedent.\n\nHISTORY: 1996 Act No. 370, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
