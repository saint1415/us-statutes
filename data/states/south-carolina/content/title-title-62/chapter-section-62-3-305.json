      "text": "(a) The moving party must give notice as described by Section 62-1-401 of his application for informal probate to any person demanding it pursuant to Section 62-3-204, and to any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated. No other notice of informal probate is required.\n\n(b) If an informal probate is granted, within thirty days thereafter the applicant shall give written information of the probate to the heirs (determined as if the decedent died intestate) and devisees. The information must include the name and address of the applicant, the date of execution of the will, and any codicil thereto, the name and location of the court granting the informal probate, and the date of the probate. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the applicant. No duty to give information is incurred if a personal representative is appointed who is required to give the written information required by Section 62-3-705. An applicant's failure to give information as required by this section is a breach of his duty to the heirs and devisees but does not affect the validity of the probate.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 37; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
