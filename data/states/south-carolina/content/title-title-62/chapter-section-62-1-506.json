His death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier.\n\n(6) In the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stated on a document described in subsection (2) or (3), a document described in subsection (2) or (3) that states a time of death one hundred twenty hours or more after the time of death of another person, however the time of death of the other person is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the person survived the other person by one hundred twenty hours.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; Code 1976 Section 62-1-107; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
