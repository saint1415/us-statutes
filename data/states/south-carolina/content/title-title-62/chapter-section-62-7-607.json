      "text": "If after executing a revocable trust the settlor is divorced or the marriage annulled or the spouse is a party to a valid proceeding concluded by an order purporting to terminate all marital property rights or confirming equitable distribution between spouses, the divorce or annulment or order revokes any disposition or appointment of property including beneficial interests made by such trust to the spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the spouse, and any nomination of the spouse as trustee, unless the trust expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment or order passes as if the spouse failed to survive the settlor, and other provisions conferring some power or office on this spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the settlor. If these provisions for the spouse are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the settlor's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment or order means any divorce or annulment or order which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of Section 62-2-802. A decree of separate maintenance which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of marital circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a disposition to a spouse in a revocable trust.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"If these provisions for the spouse\" for \"If provisions\", in the third sentence; in the last sentence, deleted \"or parental\" before \"change of marital\" and inserted \"a disposition to a spouse in\" before \"a revocable trust\"; and made other nonsubstantive changes.",
