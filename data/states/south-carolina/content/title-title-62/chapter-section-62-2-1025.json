If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose:\n\n(1) a subset limited by date of the user's digital assets;\n\n(2) all of the user's digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;\n\n(3) none of the user's digital assets; or\n\n(4) all of the user's digital assets to the court for review in camera.\n\nHISTORY: 2016 Act No. 260 (S.908), Section 2, eff June 3, 2016.",
