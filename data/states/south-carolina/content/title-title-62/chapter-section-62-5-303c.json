The alleged incapacitated individual, all parties, and any person who has filed a demand for notice, shall be given notice of the hearing. The alleged incapacitated individual is entitled to be present at the hearing, to conduct discovery, and to review all evidence bearing upon his condition. The hearing may be closed at the request of the alleged incapacitated individual or his guardian ad litem. The alleged incapacitated individual may waive notice of a hearing and his presence at the hearing. If there is an agreement among all the parties and the guardian ad litem's report indicates that a hearing would not further the interests of justice, the alleged incapacitated individual may waive his right to a hearing. If the alleged incapacitated individual waives his right to a hearing, the court may:\n\n(1) require a formal hearing;\n\n(2) require an informal proceeding as the court shall direct; or\n\n(3) proceed without a hearing.\n\n(B) If no formal hearing is held, the court shall issue a temporary consent order, which shall expire in thirty days.

      "text": "(A) Each examiner shall complete a notarized report setting forth an evaluation of the condition of the alleged incapacitated individual. The original report must be filed with the court by the court's deadline, but not less than forty-eight hours prior to any hearing in which the report is introduced as evidence. For good cause, the court may admit an examiner's report filed less than forty-eight hours prior to the hearing. All parties are entitled to review the reports after filing, which must be admissible as evidence. The evaluation shall contain, to the best of the examiner's knowledge and belief:\n\n(1) a description of the nature and extent of the incapacity, including specific functional impairments;\n\n(2) a diagnosis and assessment of the alleged incapacitated individual's mental and physical condition, including whether he is taking any medications that may affect his actions;\n\n(3) an evaluation of the alleged incapacitated individual's ability to exercise the rights set forth in Section 62-5-304A;\n\n(4) when consistent with the scope of the examiner's license, an evaluation of the alleged incapacitated individual's ability to learn self-care skills, adaptive behavior, social skills, and a prognosis for improvement;\n\n(5) the date of all examinations and assessments upon which the report is based;\n\n(6) the identity of the persons with whom the examiner met or consulted regarding the alleged incapacitated individual's mental or physical condition; and\n\n(7) the signature and designation of the professional license held by the examiner.\n\n(B) Unless otherwise directed by the court, the examiner may rely upon an examination conducted within the ninety-day period immediately preceding the filing of the petition, or longer at the discretion of the court in extraordinary circumstances. In the absence of bad faith, an examiner appointed by the court pursuant to Section 62-5-303B, is immune from civil liability for breach of patient confidentiality made in furtherance of his duties.\n\n(C) For the purposes of this section, at the discretion of the court, the \"examination\" must be conducted in person or virtually via telemedicine or other appropriate methods.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 25, eff June 7, 2010.
