      "text": "(a) Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will, such as the grant to the personal representative of a power of sale, the distributable assets of a decedent's estate must be distributed in kind to the extent possible through application of the following provisions:\n\n(1) A specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the thing devised to him, and a spouse or child who has selected particular assets of an estate as provided in Section 62-2-401 shall receive the items selected.\n\n(2) Any devise payable in money may be satisfied by value in kind provided:\n\n(i) the person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash;\n\n(ii) the property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution; and\n\n(iii) no residuary devisee has requested that the asset in question remain a part of the residue of the estate.\n\n(3) For the purpose of valuation under item (2), securities regularly traded on recognized exchanges, if distributed in kind, are valued at the price for the last sale of like securities traded on the business day prior to distribution, or if there was no sale on that day, at the median between amounts bid and offered at the close of that day. Assets consisting of sums owed the decedent or the estate by solvent debtors as to which there is no known dispute or defense are valued at the sum due with accrued interest or discounted to the date of distribution. For assets which do not have readily ascertainable values, a valuation as of a date not more than thirty days prior to the date of distribution, if otherwise reasonable, controls. For purposes of facilitating distribution, the personal representative may ascertain the value of the assets as of the time of the proposed distribution in any reasonable way, including the employment of qualified appraisers, even if the assets may have been previously appraised.\n\n(4) The personal property of the residuary estate must be distributed in kind if there is no objection to the proposed distribution and it is practicable to distribute undivided interests. Subject to the provisions of Section 62-3-711(b), in other cases, personal property of the residuary estate may be converted into cash for distribution.\n\n(b) After the probable charges against the estate are known, the personal representative may mail or deliver a proposal for distribution to all persons who have a right to object to the proposed distribution, notifying such persons of the pending termination of the right to object to the proposed distribution. The right of any distributee to object to the proposed distribution on the basis of the kind or value of asset he is to receive, if not waived earlier in writing, terminates if he fails to object in writing received by the personal representative within thirty days after mailing or delivery of the proposal.\n\n(c) When a personal representative or a trustee is empowered under the will or trust of a decedent to satisfy a pecuniary devise or transfer in trust, in kind with assets at their value for federal estate tax purposes, the fiduciary, in order to implement the devise or transfer in trust, shall, unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, distribute assets, including cash, fairly representative of appreciation or depreciation in the value of all property thus available for distribution in satisfaction of the pecuniary devise or transfer.\n\n(d) Personal representatives and trustees are authorized to enter into agreements with beneficiaries and with governmental authorities, agreeing to make distribution in accordance with the terms of Section 62-3-906 for any purpose which they consider to be in the best interests of the estate, including the purpose of protecting and preserving the federal estate tax marital deduction as applicable to the estate, and the guardian or conservator of a surviving beneficiary or the personal representative of a deceased beneficiary is empowered to enter into such agreements for and on behalf of the beneficiary or the deceased beneficiary.\n\n(e) The provisions of Section 62-3-906 are not intended to change the present laws applicable to fiduciaries, but are statements of the fiduciary principles applicable to these fiduciaries and are declaratory of these laws.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 41; 2000 Act No. 398, Section 5; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
