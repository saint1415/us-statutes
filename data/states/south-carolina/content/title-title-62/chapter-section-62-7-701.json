      "text": "(a) A trustee shall provide bond to secure the performance of the trustee's duties if:\n\n(1) the terms of the governing instrument require the trustee to provide bond;\n\n(2) a beneficiary requests the trustee to provide bond and the court finds the request to be reasonable; or\n\n(3) the court finds that it is necessary for the trustee to provide bond in order to protect the interests of the beneficiaries who are not able to protect themselves and whose interests otherwise are not adequately represented.\n\nHowever, in no event shall bond be required of a trustee, including a trustee appointed by the court, if the governing instrument directs otherwise. On petition of the trustee or other interested person, the court may excuse a requirement of bond, reduce the amount of the bond, release the surety, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.\n\n(b) If bond is required, it shall be filed in the court in the place in which the trust has its principal place of administration in amounts and with sureties and liabilities consistent with the requirements of South Carolina Code Sections 62-3-604 relating to bonds of personal representatives.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
