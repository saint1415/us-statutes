An agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this subsection is liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the principal or taken such action.\n\nHISTORY: 2016 Act No. 279 (S.778), Section 1, eff January 1, 2017.",
