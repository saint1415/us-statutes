      "text": "(A) If property distributed in kind (whether real or personal property) or a mortgage or other security interest therein is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee from such distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested persons, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order or the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to himself, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or his transferee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution. Any instrument described in this section on which the deed recording fee prescribed by Chapter 24, Title 12, has been paid, and which has been recorded is prima facie evidence that the sale was made for value.\n\n(B) If a will devises real property to a personal representative or authorizes a personal representative to sell real property (the title to which was not devised to the personal representative), a purchaser for value who receives a deed from the personal representative takes title to the real property free of rights of any heirs or devisees or other interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate or to any heir or devisee or other interested person in the estate. The purchaser is protected whether or not the sale was proper and regardless of whether the heirs or devisees to whom title devolved pursuant to Section 62-3-101 executed or consented to the deed; however, creditors, and others interested in the estate have a right of recourse against the personal representative under Section 62-3-712 if the sale constitutes a breach of the personal representative's fiduciary duty. This section protects a purchaser of real property from a personal representative who has title to the real property or who has sold real property to the purchaser pursuant to an authorization in the will. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the sale, even if the personal representative and the purchaser are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the sale. Any instrument described in this section on which the deed recording fee prescribed by Chapter 24, Title 12 has been paid, and which has been recorded is prima facie evidence that the sale was made for value.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 44; 2000 Act No. 398, Section 8; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.",
