The evaluation shall contain, to the best of the examiner's knowledge and belief:\n\n(1) a description of the nature and extent of the incapacity, including specific functional impairments;\n\n(2) a diagnosis and assessment of the alleged incapacitated individual's mental and physical condition, including whether he is taking any medications that may affect his actions;\n\n(3) an evaluation of the alleged incapacitated individual's ability to exercise the rights set forth in Section 62-5-407;\n\n(4) when consistent with the scope of the examiner's license, an evaluation of the alleged incapacitated individual's ability to learn self-care skills, adaptive behavior, and social skills, and a prognosis for improvement;\n\n(5) the date of all examinations and assessments upon which the report is based;\n\n(6) the identity of the persons with whom the examiner met or consulted regarding the alleged incapacitated individual's mental or physical condition; and\n\n(7) the signature and designation of the professional license held by the examiner.\n\n(B) Unless otherwise directed by the court, the examiner may rely upon an examination conducted within the ninety-day period immediately preceding the filing of the petition.
