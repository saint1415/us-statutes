      "text": "(a) Whenever a trust instrument provides that a trustee is to follow the direction of a trust investment advisor with respect to investment decisions or distribution decisions, then, except to the extent that the trust instrument provides otherwise, the trustee has no duty to:\n\n(1) monitor the conduct of the trust investment advisor;\n\n(2) provide advice to the trust investment advisor; or\n\n(3) communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the trustee would or might have exercised the trustee's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the advisor.\n\n(b) Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the trustee pertaining to matters within the scope of the trust investment advisor's authority, such as confirming that the trust investment advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the trust investment advisor's direction, are presumed to be administrative actions taken by the trustee solely to allow the trustee to perform those duties assigned to the trustee under the governing instrument and these administrative actions are not deemed to constitute an undertaking by the trustee to monitor the trust investment advisor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the trust investment advisor's authority.\n\n(c) For purposes of this section, \"investment decision\" means, with respect to any investment, the retention, purchase, sale, exchange, tender or other transaction affecting the ownership thereof, or rights therein.\n\nHISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
