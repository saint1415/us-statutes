      "text": "(A) The process for emergency orders without notice, emergency hearings, duration, and security is as follows:\n\n(1) Emergency orders without notice must not be issued unless the moving party files a summons, motion for emergency order with supporting affidavit(s), verified pleading, notice of emergency hearing, and any other document required by the court. The verified pleading, motions, and affidavits shall set forth specific facts supporting the allegation that an immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be served on adverse parties and a hearing held pursuant to subsection (B).\n\n(a) If emergency relief is required to protect the welfare of an alleged incapacitated individual, the moving party must present an affidavit from a physician who has performed an examination within thirty days prior to the filing of the action, a motion for the appointment of counsel if counsel has not been retained, and a motion for the appointment of a proposed qualified individual to serve as guardian ad litem.\n\n(b) If the emergency relief requested is an order for:\n\n(i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or\n\n(ii) the removal of an existing guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, then the moving party must submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary.\n\n(2) If the motion for an emergency order is not granted, the moving party may seek temporary relief after notice pursuant to subsection (B) or proceed to a final hearing.\n\n(3) If the motion for an emergency order is granted, the date and hour of its issuance must be endorsed on the order. The date and time for the emergency hearing must be entered on the notice of hearing and it must be no later than ten days from the date of the order or as the court determines is reasonable for good cause shown.\n\n(4) The moving party shall serve all pleadings on the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person and other adverse parties immediately after issuance of the emergency order.\n\n(5) If the moving party does not appear at the emergency hearing, the court may dissolve the emergency order without notice.\n\n(6) Evidence admitted at the hearing may be limited to pleadings and supporting affidavits. Upon good cause shown or at the court's direction, additional evidence may be admitted.\n\n(7) On two days' notice to the party who obtained the emergency order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move for the emergency order's dissolution or modification, and in that event, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the motion as expeditiously as possible and may consolidate motions.\n\n(8) No emergency order for conservatorship must be issued except upon the court receiving adequate assurances the assets will be protected, which may include providing of security by the moving party in a sum the court deems proper for costs and damages incurred by any party who without just cause is aggrieved as a result of the emergency order. A surety upon a bond or undertaking submits to the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n(9) The court may take whatever actions it deems necessary to protect assets, including, but not limited to, issuing an order to freeze accounts.\n\n(B) The process for temporary orders and temporary hearings with notice is as follows:\n\n(1) A temporary order must not be issued without notice to the adverse party.\n\n(2) An order for a temporary hearing must not be issued unless the moving party files a summons, motion for temporary hearing with supporting affidavits, and a petition or other appropriate pleading setting forth specific facts supporting the allegation that immediate relief is needed during the pendency of the action, and an affidavit of service of the notice of the temporary hearing to adverse parties.\n\n(a) If temporary relief is required to protect the welfare of an alleged incapacitated individual, in addition to the requirements set forth above in subsection (B)(2), the moving party shall present an affidavit from a physician who has performed an examination within forty-five days prior to the filing of the action, a motion for the appointment of counsel if counsel has not been retained, and a motion for appointment of a proposed qualified individual to serve as guardian ad litem.\n\n(b) If the temporary relief requested is an order for:\n\n(i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or\n\n(ii) removal of an existing guardian, conservator or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, in addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (B)(2) and (a), as applicable, the moving party shall submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary.\n\n(3) If the motion for temporary relief is not granted, the action will remain on the court docket for a final hearing.\n\n(4) If the motion for temporary relief is granted, the court shall enter a date and time for the temporary hearing on the notice of hearing.\n\n(5) The moving party shall serve pleadings on the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person, and other adverse parties. Service must be made no later than ten days prior to the temporary hearing or as the court determines is reasonable for good cause shown.\n\n(6) Temporary orders resulting from the hearing shall expire six months from the date of issuance unless otherwise specified in the order.\n\n(C) In an emergency, the court may exercise the power of a guardian with or without notice if the court makes emergency findings as required by the Adult Health Care Consent Act, Section 44-66-30.\n\n(D) After preliminary hearing upon such notice as the court deems reasonable, and if the petition requests temporary relief, the court has the power to preserve and apply the property of the alleged incapacitated individual as may be required for his benefit or the benefit of his dependents. Notice of the court's actions shall be given to interested parties as soon thereafter as possible.\n\n(E) A hearing concerning the need for appointment of a permanent guardian must be a hearing de novo as to all issues before the court.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 483, Section 3; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 22; 2000 Act No. 398, Section 10; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 29, eff June 7, 2010.

Pursuant to the court's authority to appoint a guardian, and Section 62-5-309, the guardian has the authority to maintain custody of the person of the ward and to establish the ward's place of abode, unless otherwise specified in the court's order. Other than the proceeding set forth in Section 62-5-303(C), the court does not have jurisdiction over the care, custody, and control of the person of a minor, but does have jurisdiction over the property of a minor if the court determines that the minor owns property that requires management or protection.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 66; 1988 Act No. 659, Section 5.
