In this subpart: (1) \"Account\" means a contract of deposit between a depositor and a financial institution, and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit, share account, and other like arrangements. (2) \"Agent\" means a person authorized to make account transactions for a party. (3) \"Beneficiary\" means a person named as one to whom sums on deposit in an account are payable on request after the death of all parties or for whom a party is named as the trustee. (4) \"Financial institution\" means any organization authorized to do business under state or federal laws relating to financial institutions, and includes a bank, trust company, savings bank, building and loan association, savings and loan company or association, and credit union. (5) \"Multiple-Party account\" means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties, whether or not a right of survivorship is mentioned including, but not limited to, joint accounts or POD accounts. (6) \"Net contribution of a party\" means the sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less all payments from the account made to or for the party which have not been paid to or applied to the use of another party and a proportionate share of any charges deducted from the account, plus a proportionate share of any interest or dividends earned, whether or not included in the current balance. The term includes deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of death of the party whose net contribution is in question. (7) \"Party\" means a person who, by the terms of an account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from the account other than as a beneficiary or agent. (8) \"Payment\" of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment to a party, or third person pursuant to a check or other request, and a pledge of sums on deposit by a party, or a set-off, reduction, or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge. (9) \"Proof of death\" includes a death certificate or record or report which is prima facie proof of death under Section 62-1-507. (10) \"P.O.D. designation\" means the designation of: (i) a beneficiary in an account payable on request to one party during the party's lifetime and on the party's death to one or more beneficiaries, or to one or more parties during their lifetimes and on death of all of them to one or more beneficiaries, or (ii) a beneficiary in an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries if the relationship is established by the terms of the account and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account, whether or not payment to the beneficiary is mentioned. (11) \"Receive\" as it relates to notice to a financial institution, means receipt in the office or branch office of the financial institution in which the account is established, but if the terms of the account require notice at a particular place, in the place required. (12) \"Request\" means a request for payment complying with all terms of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the financial institution. However, for purposes of this subpart, if terms of the account condition payment on advance notice, a request for payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for payment.

      "text": "(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, on death of a party sums on deposit in a multiple-party account belong to the surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 belongs to the surviving spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares, and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201, and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. (b) In an account with a POD designation: (1) on death of one of two or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed by subsection (a); (2) on death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. If two or more beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares, and there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary thereafter. If no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to the estate of the last surviving party. (c) Sums on deposit in a single-party account without a POD designation, or in a multiple-party account that, by the terms of the account, is without right of survivorship, are not affected by death of a party, but the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under Section 62-6-201 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate. A POD designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship. (d) The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary, or of the decedent's estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial institution before or after death, or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent's estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section, to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment.

(A) In addition to such other methods for registering and titling titled personal property as permitted in Title 50 and Title 56, any owner of a vehicle, mobile home, watercraft, outboard motor, or any similar personal property for which legal titles are issued and administered by the Department of Motor Vehicles or Department of Natural Resources may establish a Transfer on Death (TOD) designation upon any such title or registration, subject to the provisions of this section, for the purposes set forth herein. (B) A TOD designation on any titled personal property shall pass, upon the death of all owners of such titled personal property, to the TOD beneficiary or beneficiaries pursuant to this section and is effective by reason of this statute and such transfer is not testamentary or subject to Articles 1 through 4 (estate administration). (C) A beneficiary of a TOD designation on any titled personal property has no ownership of the titled personal property during the lifetime of the owner or owners of such titled personal property. (D) The following rules shall apply to titled personal property owned by one owner with TOD designation: (1) On the death of an owner who is the sole owner of titled personal property with a TOD designation, the titled personal property belongs to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the TOD designation. If two or more beneficiaries survive, the titled personal property must be titled to them in undivided equal shares, and there is no right of survivorship in the event of a later death of a beneficiary, unless such beneficiaries shall thereafter change the titling during their lifetimes to reflect such a right of survivorship. (2) If no beneficiary named on the TOD designation survives upon the death of the owner, then the titled personal property belongs to the estate of the owner. (3) Any sole owner who utilizes a TOD designation on titled personal property may revoke or modify the TOD designation at any time during the owner's life without the consent of any beneficiary listed on a TOD designation. (E) The following rules shall apply to titled personal property owned by two or more owners with a TOD designation: (1) Only multiple owners who own titled personal property with right of survivorship shall be entitled to utilize a TOD designation to transfer property pursuant to this section and a TOD designation for multiple owners who own titled personal property without such right of survivorship shall be ineffective. (2) On the death of one owner among multiple owners with right of survivorship the titled personal property belongs to the surviving owner or owners. If two or more owners survive, the titled personal property belongs to the surviving owners in undivided equal shares and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. (3) On the death of the last surviving owner among multiple owners with right of survivorship, the titled personal property belongs to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries named in a TOD designation. If two or more beneficiaries survive, the titled personal property belongs to them in undivided equal shares, and there is no right of survivorship in the event of a later death of a beneficiary, unless such beneficiaries shall thereafter change the titling to reflect such a right of survivorship during their lifetimes. If no beneficiary named in the TOD designation is living on the date of the last surviving owner's death, the titled personal property belongs to the estate of the last surviving owner. (4) When multiple owners own titled personal property, all of such multiple owners, or the survivors among them, must act together to establish such TOD designation or to thereafter revoke or modify such TOD designation, but the consent of any beneficiary selected in such TOD designation must not be required. (F) An owner or multiple owners of a vehicle, mobile home, or any other similar vehicle or property for which the Department of Motor Vehicles issues and administers titles shall apply to the Department of Motor Vehicles for such TOD designation pursuant to the terms of this section pursuant to the rules and standards of the department. (G) An owner or multiple owners of a watercraft, outboard motor, or any other similar watercraft or property for which the Department of Natural Resources issues and administers titles shall apply to the Department of Natural Resources for such TOD designation pursuant to the terms of this section pursuant to the rules and standards of the department. (H) The Department of Motor Vehicles or the Department of Natural Resources, as appropriate, upon request, shall retitle the appropriate titled personal property with a TOD designation, to: (1) The beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the TOD designation, if proof of death is presented to the appropriate department showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all owners of the titled personal property. (2) The personal representative of a deceased party, if proof of death is presented to the appropriate department showing that the deceased party was the last survivor of all other owners named on the title to the titled personal property and there shall be no surviving beneficiaries named in any TOD designation. (3) To such party or parties in accordance with a court order directing the retitling of such titled personal property. (I) For purposes of this section, ownership of titled personal property using \"OR\" with two or more multiple owners shall indicate \"joint tenants with right of survivorship\", while ownership using \"AND\" with two or more multiple owners shall indicate ownership \"tenants in common\". Only sole owners and multiple owners holding title to titled personal property with such right of survivorship (e.g., \"OR\" titling between multiple owners) are eligible to utilize the TOD procedures described in this statute.
