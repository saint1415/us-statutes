      "text": "(A) The parent of an alleged incapacitated individual may by will nominate a guardian for an alleged incapacitated individual. A testamentary nomination by a parent gives the nominee priority pursuant to Section 62-5-308 in any proceeding to determine incapacity and appoint a guardian. A testamentary nomination by a parent gives priority to the nominee to make health care decisions for the alleged incapacitated individual pursuant to Section 44-66-30. Such nomination creates priority under Sections 62-5-308 and 44-66-30 when the will is informally or formally probated, if prior to the will being probated, both parents are deceased or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are deceased, the nomination by the parent who died later has priority unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.\n\n(B) The spouse of an alleged incapacitated individual may by will nominate a guardian for an alleged incapacitated individual. A testamentary nomination by a spouse gives the nominee priority pursuant to Section 62-5-308 in any proceeding to determine incapacity and appoint a guardian. A testamentary nomination by a spouse gives priority to the nominee to make health care decisions for the alleged incapacitated individual pursuant to Section 44-66-30. Such nomination creates priority under Sections 62-5-308 and 44-66-30 when the will is informally or formally probated. An effective nomination by a spouse has priority over a nomination by a parent unless the nomination is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.\n\n(C) This State shall recognize a testamentary nomination under a will probated at the testator's domicile in another state.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2017 Act No. 87 (S.415), Section 5.A, eff January 1, 2019.",
