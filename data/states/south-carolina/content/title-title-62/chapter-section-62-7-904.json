In lieu of exercising the power to adjust, the trustee may convert the trust to a unitrust as permitted under Sections 62-7-904A through 62-7-904P, in which case the unitrust amount becomes the net income of the trust.\n\n(B) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in subsection (A), a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including, but not limited to:\n\n(1) the nature, purpose, and expected duration of the trust;\n\n(2) the intent of the settlor;\n\n(3) the identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries;\n\n(4) the needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital;\n\n(5) the assets held in the trust and the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property and the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary, and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor;\n\n(6) the net amount otherwise allocated to income under other sections of the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;\n\n(7) whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;\n\n(8) the actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and\n\n(9) the anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.\n\n(C) A trustee may not make an adjustment:\n\n(1) that diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a surviving spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction is allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment, but only to the extent that making such an adjustment would cause adverse tax consequences under applicable tax laws and regulations;\n\n(2) that reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;\n\n(3) that changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;\n\n(4) from any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside, but only to the extent that making such an adjustment would cause adverse tax consequences under applicable tax laws and regulations;\n\n(5) if possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment is determinative in causing an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;\n\n(6) if possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment is determinative in causing all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;\n\n(7) if the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust;\n\n(8) if the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly, except that a trustee may make an adjustment that also benefits a beneficiary even if the terms of the trust provide for trustee compensation as a percentage of the trust's income; or\n\n(9) if the trust has been converted to, and is then operating as a unitrust under Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P.\n\n(D) If subsection (C)(5), (6), (7), or (8) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.\n\n(E) A trustee may release the entire power of adjustment in subsection (A) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power causes a result described in subsections (C)(1) through (6) or subsection (C)(8) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not contemplated in subsection (C).

      "text": "(A) A court may not change a fiduciary's decision, or order a fiduciary to change its decision, to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. A fiduciary's decision is not an abuse of discretion merely because the court would have exercised the power in a different manner or would not have exercised the power.\n\n(B) The decisions subject to subsection (A) include, but are not limited to, a determination:\n\n(1) pursuant to Section 62-7-904(A) of whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal; and\n\n(2) of the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which they are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to the relevant factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power in Section 62-7-904(A).\n\n(C) If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused its discretion, the court may place the income and remainder beneficiaries in the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, according to the following rules:\n\n(1) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or in a distribution that is too small, the court must order the fiduciary to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position;\n\n(2) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court must place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, in their appropriate positions by ordering the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or ordering that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust;\n\n(3) to the extent that the court is unable, after applying items (1) and (2), to place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, the court may order the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to one or more of the beneficiaries or the trust, or both.\n\n(D) Upon a petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over the trust or estate must determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power in the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act would result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries would be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.\n\nHISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
