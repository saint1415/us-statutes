This power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances provided in Section 62-7-904(D) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner provided in Section 62-7-904(E). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if:\n\n(1) the amount of the allocation increases or decreases net income in an accounting period, as determined before the allocation, by less than ten percent; or\n\n(2) the value of the asset producing the receipt for which the allocation is made is less than ten percent of the total value of the assets of the trust at the beginning of the accounting period.\n\nHISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.",
