If a person under lawful arrest on a charge not bailable is brought before a magistrate, the magistrate shall commit the person to jail. If the offense charged is bailable, the magistrate shall take recognizance with sufficient surety, if it is offered, in default whereof the person must be incarcerated. (B) A person charged with a bailable offense must have a bond hearing within twenty-four hours of his arrest and must be released within a reasonable time, not to exceed four hours, after the bond is delivered to the incarcerating facility. (C) In determining conditions of release that will reasonably assure appearance, or if release would constitute an unreasonable danger to the community or an individual, a court, on the basis of the following information, may consider the nature and circumstances of an offense charged and the charged person's: (1) family ties; (2) employment; (3) financial resources; (4) character and mental condition; (5) length of residence in the community; (6) record of convictions; and (7) record of flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at other court proceedings. (D) A court must consider: (1) a person's criminal record; (2) any charges pending against a person at the time release is requested; (3) all incident reports generated as a result of an offense charged; (4) whether a person is an alien unlawfully present in the United States, and poses a substantial flight risk due to this status; (5) whether the charged person appears in the state gang database maintained at the State Law Enforcement Division; and (6) whether a person is currently out on bond for another offense. (E) Prior to or at the time of the bond hearing, the arresting law enforcement agency must provide the court with the following information: (1) the person's criminal record; (2) any charges pending against the person at the time release is requested; (3) all incident reports generated as a result of the offense charged; and (4) any other information that will assist the court in determining conditions of release to include, but not be limited to, notification of any existing bonds for another offense. (F) The arresting law enforcement agency shall inform the court if any of the information required in subsections (C), (D), and (E) is not available at the time of the hearing and the reason the information is not available. Failure on the part of the law enforcement agency to provide the court with the information does not constitute grounds for the postponement or delay of the person's bond hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, when a person is charged with a violation of Chapter 25, Title 16, the bond hearing may not proceed without the person's criminal record and incident report or the presence of the arresting officer. The bond hearing for a violation of Chapter 25, Title 16 must occur within twenty-four hours after the arrest. (G) A court hearing this matter has contempt powers to enforce these provisions.
