If the director has reason to believe that a label in use or prepared for use is false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that the use of the label be withheld unless it is modified in a manner as he may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person using or proposing to use the label does not accept the determination of the director, he may request a hearing, but the use of the label, if the director so directs, must be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the director. A determination by the director is conclusive unless within thirty days after the receipt of notice of the final determination the person adversely affected appeals to the Administrative Law Court as provided in Sections 1-23-380(B) and 1-23-600(D).
