On loans with cash advance not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars, a charge not to exceed two dollars and fifty cents per month if contracted for in writing by the borrower, may be charged in lieu of interest, and such loans may be repaid in weekly payments, with four weeks constituting a month.\n\n(2) Loans Over One Hundred Fifty Dollars But Not Exceeding Two Thousand Dollars. On loans with a cash advance exceeding one hundred fifty dollars but not exceeding two thousand dollars, twenty-five dollars per one hundred dollars on that portion of the cash advance not exceeding six hundred dollars; eighteen dollars per one hundred dollars on that portion of the cash advance exceeding six hundred dollars but not exceeding one thousand dollars; and twelve dollars per one hundred dollars on that portion of the cash advance exceeding one thousand dollars but not exceeding two thousand dollars when the loan is made payable over a period of one year, and proportionately at those rates over a longer or shorter period of time.\n\nIn addition to the finance charges authorized in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (a), a licensee under this chapter may contract for and receive an initial charge in such an amount as may be agreed upon in writing with the borrower, but not to exceed seven percent of the cash advance or fifty-six dollars, whichever is the lesser, for the expenses including, but not limited to, any attorney's fees and broker's fees, then or theretofore incurred and the services then or theretofore rendered by the lender incident to the loan or the security therefor, such as investigating the moral and financial standing of the borrower, investigating the security, title and similar investigations and for closing the loan, including any and all expenses incurred or services rendered at the request of the borrower or on his behalf in connection with the loan. Such initial charge may not be contracted for and received on any renewal loan more often than once in a three-month period. Upon any loan made to the borrower of a sum in excess of the amount on which the initial charge may have been charged within the three-month period, then the initial charge may be contracted for and received on the excess. The initial charge on loans not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars is a one-time charge, not a per annum charge and is not subject to refund. The initial charge on loans in excess of one hundred fifty dollars is a one-time charge, not a per annum charge and shall be subject to refund upon prepayment of the loan. The amount of the refund or refund credit shall represent at least as great a proportion of the total charges as the sum of the periodical time balances after the date of the prepayment bears to the sum of all periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the loan contract.\n\n(3) Loans Over Two Thousand But Not Over Seventy-Five Hundred Dollars. On loans with a cash advance exceeding two thousand dollars but not exceeding seventy-five hundred dollars, the finance charges authorized in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (a) shall not be permitted on any part of the loan. On such loans a licensee under this chapter may contract for and receive finance charges not to exceed nine dollars per one hundred dollars of the cash advance, when the loan is made payable over a period of one year, and proportionately at that rate over a longer or shorter period.\n\nIn addition to the finance charges authorized in subparagraph (3) of this subsection (a), a licensee under this chapter may contract for and receive an initial charge in such an amount as may be agreed upon in writing with the borrower, but not to exceed five percent of the cash advance or two hundred dollars, whichever is lesser, for the expenses including, but not limited to, any attorney's fees and broker's fees, then or theretofore incurred and the services then and theretofore rendered by the lender incident to the loan or the security therefor, such as investigating the morals and financial standing of the borrower, investigating the security, title and similar investigations and for closing the loan, including any and all expenses incurred or services rendered at the request of the borrower or on his behalf in connection with the loan. The initial charge may not be contracted for or received on any renewal loan made to the same borrower more often than once in a twelve-month period. Upon any loan made to the borrower of a sum in excess of the amount on which the initial charge may have been charged within the twelve-month period, then the initial charge may be contracted for and received on the excess. If a loan is renewed or financed after the expiration of the initial twelve-month period, the initial charge may not exceed two percent of the cash advance. The initial charge is a one-time charge, not a per annum charge and shall be subject to refund upon prepayment of the loan. The amount of the refund or refund credit shall represent at least as great a proportion of the total charges as the sum of the periodical time balances after the date of the prepayment bears to the sum of all periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the loan contract.\n\n(b) Installment payments and maximum term of loan contract. - The payments on any loan governed by this chapter shall be in substantially equal, consecutive monthly installments and shall be in an amount not less than ten dollars per month, exclusive of finance charges. The final installment shall mature within the time limits set out below:\n\nCash advance of $1000 or less 24 1/2 months Cash advance of $1001 to $1500 36 1/2 months Cash advance of $1501 to $2000 48 1/2 months Cash advance of $2001 to $7500 60 1/2 months\n\n(c) Payment prior to maturity. - Any balance to become payable under any loan contract made under the provisions of this chapter may be repaid in full prior to maturity. When such balance is so repaid before maturity, whether by payment in cash, a new loan, renewal or otherwise, the unearned portion of the charges shall be refunded or credited to the borrower. The amount of the refund or refund credit shall represent at least as great a proportion of the total charges as the sum of the periodical time balances after the date of the prepayment bears to the sum of all periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the loan contract; provided, that if a loan is renewed or refinanced during the first ninety days of the loan contract period, the refund shall be on a pro rata basis.\n\n(d) Splitting of loan prohibited. - No licensee shall induce or permit any person, nor any husband and wife, jointly or severally, to become obligated directly or contingently, or both, under more than one contract of loan at the same time, for the sole purpose of obtaining a higher rate of interest or greater charge than would otherwise be permitted by this chapter.\n\n(e) Delinquent charge; penalties for excessive charges. In addition to the charges and fees provided for by this chapter, no further or other amount may be charged, contracted for, or received, directly or indirectly, except that a licensee, if agreed to in writing, may contract for, impose, and collect a delinquent charge of five cents for each full dollar of an installment that is delinquent for ten or more days. The charge may be imposed only once on each delinquent installment and, if a portion of an installment is delinquent, the delinquent charge may be imposed only once on that portion of the installment that is delinquent. A lender may contract for and receive a minimum delinquency charge of five dollars, even if the charge exceeds five percent of the unpaid amount of the installment. The restriction does not apply to official fees as defined in Section 37-1-301(17), or actual and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court in which suit is filed and court costs incurred in the collection or to the actual and reasonable expenses of repossession, storing, and selling of property pledged as security on a contract in default, or insurance premiums or identifiable charges authorized by this chapter. If an amount in excess of the charges permitted by this chapter is charged, contracted for, or received, except as the result of an accidental or bona fide error, the contract of loan is void, and the licensee has no right to collect or receive any principal, interest, charge, or recompense. The licensee and its several members, officers, directors, and agents who participated in the violation are guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred and not less than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not less than thirty days nor more than six months.\n\n(f) Deferment charge. - If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all wholly unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the maturity of the contract is extended for a corresponding period, the licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge not exceeding one percent per month of the outstanding balance for each month of the deferment period, provided that two percent per month of the outstanding balance for each month of the deferment period may be charged on loans where the original cash advance is five hundred dollars or less. The deferment period is that period during which no payment is made or required by reason of such deferment, except that no deferment made pursuant to this subsection shall extend the maturity of any contract made under this chapter for more than two months during any twelve-months period. The deferment charge may be collected at the time of deferment or at any time thereafter. The portion of the charges contracted for under Section 34-29-140 (a) and (d) applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance and period under the original loan contract. No installment on which a delinquent charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial payment has been made, shall be deferred or included in the computation of the deferment charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period, the borrower shall receive, in addition to the refund required under Section 34-29-140 (c), a refund of that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full month or months of such deferment period.\n\nProvided, however, no deferment charge for a deferment of a period of one month or less shall exceed ten dollars.\n\n(g) Charges not deducted in advance. - Finance charges and initial charges made under this chapter shall not be paid, deducted, or received in advance, but shall be added to the cash advance.\n\n(h) Loans to purchase real estate prohibited. - A licensee shall not contract for or receive the charges authorized by this chapter, on any loan which is directly or indirectly for the purchase price of real estate or an interest therein and which is secured by a purchase money lien or interest therein; provided, that this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a licensee from taking a nonpurchase money lien, whether primary or secondary, on real estate as security for a loan made in compliance with this chapter, and contracting for or receiving on such loan the charges authorized by this chapter.\n\n(i) In addition to all other charges authorized by this section, a licensee may charge and add to the gross note a maintenance fee of two dollars for each month for the term of the loan for each loan account. If the loan is prepaid, the maintenance fee must be refunded pro rata with the unexpired term of the loan and a part of a month must be treated like a full month.\n\n(j) Change of Dollar Amounts. - The dollar amounts provided in subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section shall change from time to time in the manner provided by Section 37-1-109, except that the index for December, 1991, is the Reference Base Index for purposes of adjustments to the dollar amounts of this section. The Chairman of the State Board of Financial Institutions has the same powers and duties in regard to the adjustments to the dollar amounts of subsection (a)(2) of this section as does the Administrator of the Department of Consumer Affairs with adjustments to the dollar amounts required in Section 37-1-109.\n\n(k) Dollar Limits on Renewals. A licensee under this chapter may not renew a loan more than one time during any fifteen-month period where the actual dollars given to the customer is less than ten percent of the net outstanding loan balance at the time of renewal.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-800.10; 1956 (49) 2052, 2967; 1957 (50) 339; 1966 (54) 2391; 1967 (55) 558; 1976 Act No. 686 Section 56; 1977 Act No. 137; 1980 Act No. 392, Sections 1, 2; 1986 Act No. 370, Section 1; 1991 Act No. 98, Sections 1, 2, eff May 30, 1991; 1995 Act No; 135, Sections 2, 3, eff January 1, 1996; 2001 Act No. 44, Section 1, eff May 29, 2001.",

      "text": "Subject to the conditions provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, reasonable insurance may be sold to and required of the borrower for insuring personal property securing a loan and for insuring the life and earning capacity of not more than two parties obligated on the loan other than accommodation parties.\n\nProperty insurance shall be in an amount not to exceed the reasonable value of the property insured and for the customary term approximating the term of the loan contract. It shall be optional with the borrower to obtain such insurance in an amount greater than the amount of the loan or for a longer term.\n\nLife insurance must be in an amount not to exceed the approximate amount of the debt and for a term not exceeding the approximate term of the loan contract. For purposes of credit coverage, the 'approximate amount of the debt' is defined as follows: (1) the periodic installment payment multiplied by the number of scheduled periodic installment payments for a loan with a term of sixty months or less; (2) the amount necessary to liquidate the remaining debt in a single lump sum payment, excluding all unearned interest and other unearned finance charges, plus six monthly installment payments for a loan with a term in excess of sixty months. Accident and health insurance and unemployment insurance, or both, must provide periodic benefits which may not exceed an amount which approximately equals the amount of each periodic installment payment to be made under the loan contract. However, when a loan is discharged or a new policy or policies of insurance are issued, the life, property, or accident and health insurance or all three on the prior obligation must be canceled and the unearned portion of the insurance premium or premiums, or identifiable charge, must be refunded to the borrower. However, the method of refunding the premiums on the policies must be pursuant to the Rule of 78 or the Sum of the Digits Method, except that no refund under three dollars must be made. The insurance company shall calculate its reserves on the policies in the same manner or, in the case of credit life insurance, in accordance with a mortality table and interest assumption used for ordinary life policies. Notwithstanding this requirement, if the property insurance policy or policies cover the insurable interest of the borrower as well as the lender, the policy or policies may be continued in force at the request of the borrower.\n\nThis section does not require a creditor to grant a refund or credit of a life insurance premium to the debtor if any refund or credit due to the debtor under this section is less than three dollars. If the coverage provides accident and health benefits, the policy or certificate shall contain a provision that, if the insured obligor is disabled, as defined in the policy, for a period of more than three days, benefits shall commence as of the first day of disability, provided that accident and health insurance shall not be allowed on loans with a cash advance of less than one hundred dollars. Disability shall not be defined more restrictively than the inability of the insured to engage in his own occupation during the first year of disability or for the length of the benefit period if less than one year. After the first year of disability, disability shall not be defined more restrictively than the inability of the insured to engage in the substantial duties of any gainful occupation for substantially equivalent remuneration to the insured's own occupation. Substantially equivalent remuneration means not less than seventy-five percent of the insured's base wage, exclusive of overtime and bonus, as of the date disability commences.\n\nAll insurance sold or provided pursuant to this section shall bear a reasonable and bona fide relation to the existing hazard or risk of loss and shall be written by an agent or agency licensed in this State in an insurance company authorized to conduct such business in this State. A licensee shall not require the purchasing of insurance from the licensee or any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee, as a condition precedent to the making of a loan and shall not decline existing insurance where such insurance is provided by an insurance company authorized to conduct such business in this State.\n\nThe licensee shall within thirty days after the loan is made, deliver to the borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, a policy or certificate of insurance covering any insurance procured by or through the licensee or any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee, which shall set forth the amount of any premium or identifiable charge which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the amount of insurance, the term of insurance, and a complete description of the risks insured. Such policy or certificate may contain a mortgage clause or other appropriate provisions to protect the insurable interest of the licensee.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any gain or advantages in the form of commission, dividend, identifiable charge, or otherwise, to the licensee or to any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from such insurance or its sale shall not be deemed to be additional or further interest or charge in connection with such a loan.\n\nAny accident and health or property insurance sold in conjunction with this chapter must be written on forms and at rates approved by the South Carolina Department of Insurance, provided that a minimum charge of three dollars may be made, pursuant to reasonable regulations adopted by it and having as their purpose the establishment and maintenance of premium rates which are reasonably commensurate with the coverage afforded and which are adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory giving due consideration to past or prospective loss experience within or without this State, to dividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to borrowers, to reasonable expense allowances necessary to achieve proper risk distribution and spread, and to all other relevant factors within or without this State. These regulations may include reasonable classification systems or programs based upon identifiable and measurable variations in the hazards or expense requirements and may include statistical plans, systems, or programs, which the insurers may be required to adopt, for the purpose of providing that statistical information and data as may be necessary or reasonably appropriate to the determination of premium rates or rate levels. The premium rates and rate levels must be calculated to produce and maintain a ratio of losses incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, to premiums earned, or reasonably expected to be earned, of not less than fifty percent, and rates producing a lesser loss ratio are considered excessive.\n\nUntil January 1, 2001, credit life insurance premiums for each one hundred dollars of indebtedness are considered reasonable and may be charged if they are not greater than the amounts given in the following table times the number of years, or fraction of a year, that the indebtedness covered by insurance is scheduled to continue, subject to a minimum charge of three dollars:\n\nDecreasing Balance Level Balance Individual $ .65 $1.30 Joint Insurance $1.08 $2.16\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, credit life insurance premiums for each one hundred dollars of indebtedness are considered reasonable and may be charged if they are not greater than the amounts given in the following table times the number of years, or fraction of a year, that the indebtedness covered by insurance is scheduled to continue:\n\nDecreasing Balance Level Balance Individual $ .57 $1.14 Joint Insurance $ .95 $1.89\n\nEffective January 1, 2003, credit life insurance premiums for each one hundred dollars of indebtedness are considered reasonable and may be charged if they are not greater than the amounts given in the following table times the number of years, or fraction of a year, that the indebtedness covered by insurance is scheduled to continue:\n\nDecreasing Balance Level Balance Individual $ .55 $1.10 Joint Insurance $ .91 $1.83\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-800.12; 1956 (49) 2052, 2967; 1957 (50) 339; 1966 (54) 2391; 1985 Act No. 139, Sections 1, 2; 1986 Act No. 444, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 54 Sections 1, 2, eff April 28, 1987; 1991 Act No. 142, Section 16(B), eff January 1, 1993; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 524, eff July 1, 1995; 1995 Act No. 135, Section 4, eff January 1, 1996; 1999 Act No. 66, Section 1, eff January 1, 2000; 2002 Act No. 228, Section 1, eff May 1, 2002.",
