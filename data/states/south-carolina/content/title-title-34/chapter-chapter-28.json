The application for authority to organize must be filed with the Board in triplicate and must be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee established by the Board.\n\n(3)(a) Upon the filing of an application, the Board shall make an investigation of:\n\n1. the character, reputation, financial standing, experience, and business qualifications of the proposed officers and directors;\n\n2. the character, reputation, financial standing, and motives of the incorporator or incorporators in organizing the proposed association;\n\n3. the public need for an association or additional association, as the case may be, in the primary service area where the proposed association is to be located, giving particular consideration to the ability of the primary service area to support both the proposed and all other existing associations in the community in the conduct of profitable operations and to the benefits of competition to the public.\n\n(b) Any applicant who files an application which requires an investigation to be conducted outside the State shall reimburse the Board for all costs incurred in the normal course of investigation, which reimbursement must be in addition to the filing fee authorized in this section.\n\n(4) The Board shall approve the application unless it finds that one or more of the conditions in (a) through (f) exist:\n\n(a) Public convenience and advantage will not be promoted by the establishment of the proposed association. In determining whether an applicant meets this requirement, the Board shall consider all materially relevant factors, including:\n\n1. the location and services proposed to be offered by the applicant and currently offered by existing associations in the primary service area to be served by the applicant; and\n\n2. the primary service area's general economic and demographic characteristics.\n\n(b) Local conditions do not indicate reasonable promise of the successful operation of the proposed association and of those associations already established in the primary service area community. In determining whether an applicant meets this requirement, the Board shall consider all materially relevant factors, including:\n\n1. Current economic conditions and the growth potential of the primary service area in which the proposed association intends to locate; and\n\n2. The growth rate, size, financial strength, and operating characteristics of other associations in the primary service area of the proposed association.\n\n(c) The proposed officers and directors do not have sufficient experience, ability, standing, and responsibility to indicate reasonable promise of the successful operation of the association.\n\n(d) The applicant's proposed capital structure is inadequate. In no event may the minimum capital required be less than three million dollars or that larger amount as may be specified in a regulation issued by the Board.\n\n(e) The name of the proposed association does not comply with Section 34-28-110.\n\n(f) No provision has been made for suitable quarters at the location specified in the application.\n\n(5) The order approving an application may impose reasonable conditions which must be met before a certificate of authorization to transact business will be issued, which conditions may include employment of suitable personnel, alterations to the proposed capital structure, the obtaining of suitable quarters at the location proposed, or those other matters as the Board may deem necessary. If the Board approves the application for authority to organize, the applicant shall file its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State and apply for a commitment for appropriate insurance of accounts. Upon approval by the Board of the application for authority to organize, the Board shall forward a copy of its final order to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The corporate existence of an association begins on the date that the approved articles of incorporation are filed with the Secretary of State, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, but the association shall not commence business before it is in possession of a certificate of authorization to transact business as provided in Section 34-28-150. Prior to that time, an association may perform only those acts as are necessary to perfect its organization, raise capital, obtain and equip a place of business, and otherwise prepare for a general savings association business.\n\nHISTORY: 1985 Act No. 124, Section 1.",

These words must be preceded by an appropriate descriptive word or words approved by the Board. An ordinal number may not be used as a single descriptive word in the association's name immediately preceding the words \"savings association\", \"savings and loan association\", or \"savings bank\" unless the words are followed by the words \"of __________,\" the blank being filled by the name of the community, town, city, county, or state in which the association has its home office. The use of the words \"National\", \"United States\", \"insured\", or \"guaranteed\", separately or in any combination thereof with other words or syllables, is prohibited as part of the corporate name of an association. No certificate of incorporation of a proposed association having the same name as a corporation authorized to do business under the laws of this State or a name so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the mind of the public with any other financial depository institution in this State may be approved by the Board, except for an association formed by the reincorporation, reorganization, conversion, or consolidation of the other financial depository institution with the proposed association or upon the sale of all or substantially all the property and franchise of the other financial institution to the proposed association. Nothing herein may be construed to require or cause any association doing business to change its name from the way it exists on April 1, 1985. In addition to meeting the requirements of this subsection, the name of a stock-owned association must also comply with Section 34-28-130(1)(a).\n\n(2) No person, unless he or it is lawfully authorized to do business in this State under the provisions of this chapter and actually is engaged in carrying on a savings association business, shall do business under any name or title which contains the terms \"savings association\", \"savings and loan association\", \"savings bank\", \"building and loan association\", \"building association\", or any combination employing either or both of the words \"building\" or \"loan\" with one or more of the words \"saving\" or \"savings\", or words of similar import, with one or more of the words \"association\", \"institution\", \"society\", \"company\", \"fund\", or \"corporation\", or words of similar import, or use any name or sign or circulate or use any letterhead, billhead, circular, or paper whatever, or advertise or represent in any manner which indicates or reasonably implies that his business is the character or kind of business carried on or transacted by an association or which is likely to lead any person to believe that his business is that of an association; however, the words \"saving\", \"savings\", \"company\", or \"corporation\", or the plural of any thereof, may be used by, and in the corporate or other name or title of, any company which is or becomes a savings and loan holding company pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Upon application by the Board or any association, a court of competent jurisdiction may issue an injunction to restrain any person from violating or continuing to violate any of the foregoing provisions of this subsection. Any person who violates any provision of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, and each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.

Capital stock shall have the par value stated in the articles of incorporation and, with the prior approval of the Board, may consist of common stock and preferred stock which may be divided into classes and classes may be divided into series. Each kind, class, and series may have those distinguishing characteristics, including designations, preferences, or restrictions as regards dividends, redemption, voting powers, or restrictions or qualifications of voting powers, as are imposed in the articles of incorporation. The provisions of the articles of incorporation shall control in any case in which any vote or consent of stockholders is now or hereafter required by statute unless the statute shall expressly provide to the contrary.\n\n(2) The consideration for the issuance of shares must be paid in full before their issuance and must not be less than the par value. The consideration for the shares must be paid in cash. Upon payment, the shares are considered to be fully paid and nonassessable.\n\n(3) The total of the par values of all outstanding shares of common and preferred capital stock is the permanent capital of the association and any amount received as consideration for outstanding shares in excess of the par values must be credited to capital surplus. No association shall reduce its permanent capital or distribute any of its capital surplus to shareholders without first obtaining the consent of the Board. Except in supervisory cases, this consent must be withheld if the reduction will cause the permanent capital to be less than the minimum required by the Board at the time of the distribution to capitalize a new stock association.\n\n(4) Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, no shareholder in a state stock association shall have the preemptive right to acquire unissued shares, or securities convertible or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares, of the association. In the case of any capital stock association in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter, stockholders of this association shall continue to have the preemptive rights in this association which they had immediately prior to this date, unless and until the articles of incorporation are amended to alter or terminate stockholders' preemptive rights.\n\n(5) An association shall not make a loan secured by the pledge of its capital stock.\n\n(6) No subscriber to the stock of a proposed stock-owned association shall own or control as principal more than ten percent of any class of voting shares of the association without prior approval of the Board. No mutual association shall own or control as principal, directly or indirectly, any stock of any association, bank, bank holding company, as defined in 12 U.S.C. Section 1841(a)(1) as amended, or savings and loan holding company, as defined in the Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1730a(a)(1) (D) as amended, or any other depository financial institution. No association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other depository financial institution shall own or control as principal, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of any class of the outstanding voting shares of any stock-owned association without prior approval of the Board, and no stock-owned association shall own or control as principal, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of any class of the outstanding voting shares of any association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other depository institution without prior approval of the Board; provided, that no stock-owned association or holding company owning any of the stock of the association, which desires to own stock in any bank doing business in this State or any bank holding company owning any of the stock of the bank, shall own as principal more stock in that bank or bank holding company than that bank or bank holding company is permitted to own in a stock-owned association or holding company owning any of the stock of the association. The prohibitions of this section do not apply to a savings and loan holding company's owning all of the outstanding stock of a stock-owned association. Any stock of a stock-owned association which is used as loan collateral and which is acquired by a financial institution by loan default or is acquired as a result of a bankruptcy does not constitute a violation of this restriction if the acquiring institution divests itself of this stock within five years of acquisition or that longer period as may be approved by the Board. The restriction in Section 34-28-540(3) against an association's owning five percent or more of any class of voting stock in any corporation, other than a service corporation or a subsidiary in which it owns all of the voting shares, is not applicable to the stock ownership permitted by this subsection.\n\nHISTORY: 1985 Act No. 124, Section 1.",

Within three months after the date of the meeting, the association shall commence that action in the manner prescribed and authorized by the laws of the United States as shall make it a federal association. There must be filed with the Board a copy of the charter issued to the federal association by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or a certificate showing the organization of the association as a federal association, certified by the secretary or assistant secretary of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

The federal association as of the time of the taking effect of the conversion shall continue to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations, and relations of the converting association. All pending actions and other judicial proceedings to which the converting state association is a party are not considered to have abated or to have discontinued by reason of the conversion, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order, or decree in the same manner as if the conversion into the federal association had not been made, and the federal association resulting from the conversion may continue those actions in its corporate name as a federal association; and any judgment, order, or decree may be rendered for or against it which might have been rendered for or against the converting state association involved in the judicial proceedings.\n\n(2) Any association or corporation which has converted itself into a federal association under the provisions of the laws of the United States and has received a charter from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is thereafter recognized as a federal association, and its federal charter must be given full recognition by the courts of this State to the same extent as if the conversion had taken place under the provisions of this section; provided, there must have been compliance with the foregoing requirements with respect to the filing with the Board of a copy of the federal charter or a certificate showing the organization of the association as a federal association. All these conversions are hereby ratified and confirmed, and all the obligations of an association which has so converted shall continue as valid and subsisting obligations of the federal association, and the title to all of the property of the association is considered to have continued and vested, as of the date of issuance of the federal charter, in the federal association as fully and completely as if the conversion had taken place pursuant to this section since the effective date of this chapter.\n\nHISTORY: 1985 Act No. 124, Section 1.",

After receipt of the notice, the association may refuse, without liability, to honor any check, receipt, or withdrawal order or deletion request on the account pending determination of the rights of the parties. No association paying any survivor in accordance with the provisions of this section is liable for any estate, inheritance, or succession taxes which may be due this State.\n\n(2) Subject to Section 34-28-500, any association may accept deposits in the name of any administrator, executor, custodian, conservator, guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary for a named beneficiary or beneficiaries. The withdrawal value of any account, and earnings thereon, or other rights relating thereto may be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to the fiduciary without regard to any notice to the contrary as long as the fiduciary is living. The payment or delivery to a fiduciary or a receipt or acquittance signed by a fiduciary to whom any payment or any delivery or rights is made is a valid and sufficient release and discharge of an association for the payment or delivery so made. Whenever a person holding an account in a fiduciary capacity dies and no written notice of the revocation or termination of the fiduciary relationship has been given to an association and the association has no written notice of any other disposition of the beneficial estate, the withdrawal value of the account, and earnings thereon, or other rights relating thereto may, at the option of the association, be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Whenever an account is opened by any person, describing himself in opening the account as trustee for another and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust than the description is given in writing to the association, in the event of the death of the person so described as trustee the withdrawal value of the account or any part thereof together with the earnings thereon may be paid to the person for whom the account was thus described to have been opened. The payment or delivery to any beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person, or a receipt of acquittance signed by any beneficiary, beneficiaries, or designated person, is for any payment or delivery a valid and sufficient release and discharge of an association for the payment or delivery so made. No association paying any fiduciary, beneficiary, or designated person in accordance with the provisions of this section is liable for any estate, inheritance, or succession taxes which may be due this State.\n\n(3) When a deposit account is held in any association by a person who becomes incompetent and an adjudication of incompetency has been made by a court of competent jurisdiction, the association may pay or deliver the withdrawal value of the account and any earnings that may have accrued thereon to the conservator for the person upon proof of his appointment and qualification; provided, that if the association has received no written notice and is not on actual notice that the account holder has been adjudicated incompetent, it may pay or deliver the funds to the holder in accordance with the provisions of the savings account contract, and the receipt or acquittance of the holder therefor is a valid and sufficient release and discharge of the association for the payment or delivery so made.\n\n(4) When a deposit account is held in any association by a person residing in another state or country, the account, together with additions thereto and earnings thereon, or any part thereof, is exempt from any taxation otherwise imposed by this State and may be paid to the administrator or executor appointed in the state or country where the account holder resided at the time of death; provided, the administrator or executor has furnished the association with (i) authenticated copy of his letters and of the order of the court which issued the letters to him authorizing him to collect, receive, and remove the personal estate, and (ii) an affidavit by the administrator or executor that to his knowledge no letters of administration then are outstanding in this State and no petition for letters of administration by an heir, legatee, devisee, or creditor of the decedent is pending on the estate in this State, and (iii) that there are no creditors of the estate in this State. Upon payment or delivery to the representatives after receipt of the affidavit and authenticated copies, the association is released and discharged to the same extent as if the payment or delivery had been made to a legally qualified resident executor or administrator, and is not required to see to the application or disposition of the property. No action at law or in equity may be maintained against the association for payment made in accordance with this section.\n\nHISTORY: 1985 Act No. 124, Section 1.",
