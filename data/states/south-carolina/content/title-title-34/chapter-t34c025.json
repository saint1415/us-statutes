      "text": "(a) To the extent consistent with subsection (c) of this section, the board may make such examinations of any branch established and maintained in this State pursuant to this article by an out-of-state state bank as the board may deem necessary to determine whether the branch is being operated in compliance with the laws of this State and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices. (b) The board may prescribe requirements for periodic reports regarding any out-of-state bank that operates a branch in South Carolina pursuant to this article. The required reports shall be provided by such bank or by the bank supervisory agency having primary responsibility for such bank. Any reporting requirements prescribed by the board under this subsection (b) shall be (i) consistent with the reporting requirements applicable to South Carolina state banks and (ii) appropriate for the purpose of enabling the board to carry out its responsibilities under this article. (c) The board may enter into cooperative, coordinating, and information-sharing agreements with any other bank supervisory agencies or any organization affiliated with or representing one or more bank supervisory agencies with respect to the periodic examination or other supervision of any branch in South Carolina of an out-of-state state bank, or any branch of a South Carolina state bank in any host state, and the board may accept such parties' reports of examination and reports of investigation in lieu of conducting its own examinations or investigations. (d) The board may enter into contracts with any bank supervisory agency that has concurrent jurisdiction over a South Carolina state bank or an out-of-state state bank operating a branch in this State pursuant to this article to engage the services of such agency's examiners at a reasonable rate of compensation, or to provide the services of the board's examiners to such agency at a reasonable rate of compensation. Any such contract shall be deemed a sole source contract. (e) The board may enter into joint examinations or joint enforcement actions with other bank supervisory agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over any branch in South Carolina of an out-of-state state bank or any branch of a South Carolina state bank in any host state; provided that the board at any time may take such actions independently if the board deems such actions to be necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this article or to ensure compliance with the laws of this State; and provided, further, that, in the case of an out-of-state state bank, the board shall recognize the exclusive authority of the home state regulator over corporate governance matters and the primary responsibility of the home state regulator with respect to safety and soundness matters. (f) Each out-of-state state bank that maintains one or more branches in this State may be assessed and, if assessed, shall pay supervisory and examination fees in accordance with the laws of this State and regulations of the board.
