Costs incurred by the department to obtain an order granting, in whole or in part, the petition for enforcement of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum must be taxed against the subpoenaed person, and failure to comply with the order is a contempt of court.\n\n(E) Witnesses are entitled to the same fees and mileage as they may be entitled by law for attending as witnesses in the circuit court, except where the examination or investigation is held at the place of business or residence of the witness.\n\n(F) The material compiled by the department in an investigation or examination under this chapter is confidential until the investigation or examination is complete or final action by the department is otherwise taken.

This confidentiality provision shall not prohibit:\n\n(1) the disclosure of investigative material in investigations that are otherwise final if the material submitted to the other law enforcement agency is not directly related to loan brokering business; or\n\n(2) the disclosure of such material as is public information after civil or criminal prosecution is filed.\n\n(G) The department shall cooperate with and assist other state or federal agencies in enforcing applicable regulation of loan brokers to the extent such cooperation and assistance does not violate this chapter or the public policy of this State.
