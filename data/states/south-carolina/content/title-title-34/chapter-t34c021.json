In the event that such audit is performed by independent public accountants, the reasonable expenses of such audit may be charged to the common trust fund. (2) A trust institution administering a common trust fund shall at least once during each period of twelve months prepare a financial report of the fund which shall be filed with the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks and with the State Board of Bank Control in the case of State banks. This report, based upon the above audit, shall contain a list of the investments in the fund showing the cost and the market value of each investment; a statement for the period since the previous report showing purchases, with cost; sales, with profit or loss, and any other investment changes; income and disbursements; and an appropriate notation as to any investments in default. (3) The financial report may include a description of the fund's value on previous dates as well as its income and disbursements during previous accounting periods. The report shall make no reference to the performance of funds other than those administered by the bank and no predictions or representations as to future results. (4) A copy of the financial report shall be furnished, or notice shall be given that a copy of such report is available and will be furnished without charge upon request, to each person to whom a regular periodic accounting would ordinarily be rendered with respect to each participating account. In addition, a full report shall be furnished to any person, and the fact of the availability of such material may be given publicity solely in connection with the promotion of the fiduciary services of the trust institution. Except as herein provided, the trust institution shall not advertise or publicize its common trust fund(s). The cost of printing and distribution of the report shall be borne by the trust institution. HISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-599.3; 1955 (49) 538; 1965 (54) 608; 1969 (56) 733.",
