The failure of the person receiving the check to obtain the information specified in items (1) or (2) of this subsection shall not warrant dismissal of a prosecution or other action brought pursuant to this section, but the party bringing the action shall in such circumstances have the burden of proving that the defendant signed or endorsed the check and presented it in payment of some debt or other obligation.\n\n(1) To establish this prima facie evidence, the full name, residence address, and telephone number of the person presenting the check, draft, or other written order must be obtained by the party receiving the instrument. This information may be provided by having the information recorded on the check or instrument itself, or the number of a check-cashing identification card issued by the receiving party may be recorded on the check. The check-cashing identification card must be issued only after the full name, residence address, and telephone number of the person presenting the check, draft, or other written order has been placed on file by the receiving party.\n\n(2) In addition to the information required in item (1) of this subsection, the party receiving a check shall witness the signature or endorsement of the party presenting the check and as evidence of such, the receiving party shall initial the check. Validation by a bank teller machine shall constitute compliance with this item.\n\n(c) It shall be the duty of the drawee of any check, draft, or other written order, before refusing to pay the same to the holder thereof upon presentation, to cause to be written, printed, or stamped in plain language thereon or attached thereto, the reason for drawee's dishonor or refusal to pay same. In all prosecutions under this section, the introduction in evidence of any unpaid and dishonored check, draft or other written order, having the drawee's refusal to pay stamped or written thereon, or attached thereto, with the reason therefor as aforesaid, shall be prima facie evidence of the making or uttering of such check, draft, or other written order, and the due presentation to the drawee for payment and the dishonor thereof, and that the same was properly dishonored for the reasons written, stamped or attached by the drawee on such dishonored check, draft, or other written order; and, as against the maker or drawer thereof, the withdrawing from deposit with the drawee named in the check, draft or other written order, the funds on deposit with such drawee necessary to insure payment of such check, draft or other written order upon presentation within ten days after negotiation; or the drawing, making, uttering or delivering of a check, draft or written order, payment of which is refused by the drawee, shall be prima facie evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds in or credit with such drawee; provided, however, if it is determined at the trial in a prosecution hereunder, that the payee of any such check, draft or written order at the time of accepting such check, draft or written order, had knowledge of or reason to believe that the drawer of such check, draft or other written order did not have sufficient funds on deposit in or credit with such drawee, then the payee instituting such criminal prosecution shall be assessed all costs of court incurred in connection with such prosecution.\n\n(d) The word \"credit\" as used in this section means securing further advances of money, goods, or services by means of a check, draft, or other written order, given in whole or in part payment of a then existing account. Payment for meals, lodging, or other goods or services at a hotel, motel, or other hostelry by means of a check, draft, or other written order before or upon departure or checkout from the hostelry is obtaining those goods or services by means of a check, draft, or other written order for the purposes of this section. This section applies to a check given in full or partial payment of any preexisting debt. This section does not apply to the giving of a check, draft, or other written order if the payee knows, has been expressly notified, or has reason to believe that the drawer did not have an account or have on deposit with the drawee sufficient funds to ensure payment of the check, nor to any check which has not been deposited to an account of the payee within a period of ten days from the date the check was presented to the payee. It is also unlawful for any person to induce, solicit, or to aid and abet any other person to draw, make, utter, issue, or deliver to any person including himself any check, draft, or other written order on any bank or depository for the payment of money or its equivalent, being informed, knowing, or having reasonable cause for believing at the time of the inducing, soliciting, or the aiding and abetting that the maker or the drawer of the check, draft, or other written order has not sufficient funds on deposit in, or an account with, the bank or depository with which to pay the same upon presentation.\n\n(e) No warrant for a violation of this section may be obtained more than one hundred eighty days after the date the check was uttered.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-176; 1952 Code Section 8-176; 1942 Code Section 1167; 1932 Code Section 1167; Cr.

Service charges collected pursuant to this section must be paid to the payee of the instrument.\n\n(1) For purposes of subsection (a), notice must be given by mailing the notice with postage prepaid addressed to the person at the address as printed or written on the instrument. The giving of notice by mail is complete upon the expiration of ten days after the deposit of the notice in the mail. A certificate by the payee that the notice has been sent as required by this section is presumptive proof that the requirements as to notice have been met, regardless of the fact that the notice actually might not have been received by the addressee. The form of notice must be substantially as follows:\n\n\"You are notified that a check or instrument, numbered ___, issued by you on ___ (date), drawn upon ___ (name of bank), and payable to ___, has been dishonored. Pursuant to South Carolina law, you have ten days from the date this notice was mailed to tender payment of the full amount of the check or instrument plus a service charge of thirty dollars, the total amount due being ___ dollars and ___ cents. Unless this amount is paid in full within the specified time above, the holder of the check or instrument may turn over the dishonored check or instrument and all other available information relating to this incident to the solicitor or other appropriate officer for criminal prosecution.\"\n\n(2) When a person instituting prosecution gives notice in substantially similar form provided in item (1) to the person upon which the instrument was drawn and waits ten days from the date notice is mailed before instituting the criminal proceedings, there arises a presumption that the prosecution was instituted for reasonable and probable cause, and the person instituting prosecution is immune from civil liability for the giving of the notice.\n\n(3) A service charge of not more thirty dollars is payable by the drawer of a draft, a check, or other written order to the payee of the instrument when the draft, check, or other written order is presented for payment in whole or in part of a then existing debt including, but not limited to, consumer credit transactions, and is dishonored. This service charge is solely to compensate the payee of the instrument for incurred expenses in processing the dishonored instrument and is not related to a presumption of fraud so that it is not necessary to issue the notice to the person at the address as printed on the instrument set forth in items (1) and (2).\n\n(b) Any court, including magistrate's, may dismiss a case under the provisions of this chapter for want of prosecution. When any prosecutions are initiated under this chapter, the party applying for the warrant is held liable for all reasonable administrative costs accruing not to exceed forty-one dollars if the case is dismissed for want of prosecution. Unless waived by the court, the party applying for the warrant shall notify, orally or otherwise, the court not less than twenty-four hours before the date and time set for trial that full restitution has been made in connection with the warrant, and the notification relieves that party of the responsibility of prosecution.\n\n(c) Any court, including magistrates, may dismiss any prosecution initiated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on satisfactory proof of restitution and payment by the defendant of all administrative costs accruing not to exceed forty-one dollars submitted before the date set for trial after the issuance of a warrant.\n\n(d) For purposes of this chapter, subsequent persons receiving a check, draft, or other written order by endorsement from the original payee or a successor endorsee have the same rights that the original payee has against the maker of the instrument, if the maker of the instrument has the same defenses against subsequent persons as he may have had against the original payee. However, the remedies available under this chapter may be exercised only by one party in interest.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 8-177; 1952 Code Section 8-177; 1942 Code Section 1167; 1932 Code Section 1167; Cr.

If the defendant has had no other conviction during the one-year period following the conviction under this section, the court shall issue an order expunging the records. No person has any rights under this section more than one time.
