(B)(1) When an arrest is made in this State by a law enforcement officer of another state pursuant to subsection (A), the law enforcement officer must, without unnecessary delay, take the person arrested before a judicial official of this State. (2) The judicial official must conduct a hearing for the limited purpose of determining whether the arrest meets the requirements of this section unless the person arrested executes a written waiver of his right to a hearing under this section. If the judicial official determines that the arrest was unlawful, he must discharge the person arrested. If the judicial official determines that the arrest was lawful, he must commit the person arrested to imprisonment for twenty days as provided in Section 17-9-10. Once the person is imprisoned pursuant to this section, the provisions of Title 17, Chapter 9 govern the extradition and return of the person to the state in which the criminal offense was committed. (C) For the purpose of this section: (1) \"Law enforcement officer\" means an appointed officer or employee who is hired by and regularly on the payroll of a state or any political subdivision, who is granted the statutory authority to enforce all or some of the criminal, traffic, or penal laws of their respective state, and who is granted or possesses with respect to those laws, the power to effect arrests for offenses committed or alleged to have been committed. (2) \"Fresh pursuit\" means a pursuit by a law enforcement officer of a person who is in the immediate and continuous flight from the commission of a criminal offense. (D) The authority granted by this section is limited to criminal offenses of the pursuing state that also are criminal offenses under the laws of this State and that are punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the laws of the pursuing state. (E) This section applies only to a law enforcement officer from Georgia or North Carolina if the officer's employing or appointing state has enacted a provision similar to this section relating to the arrest and custody of a person pursued into a neighboring state.

(2) It is unlawful for a person to display, cause or permit to be displayed, or have in the person's possession a false, fictitious, fraudulent, or counterfeit picture identification for the purpose of offering proof of the person's lawful presence in the United States. A person who violates the provisions of this item: (a) for a first offense, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days; and (b) for a second offense or subsequent offenses, is guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than five years. (3) If the person cannot provide the law enforcement officer with any of the forms of picture identification listed in this subsection, the person may still be presumed to be lawfully present in the United States, if the officer is able to otherwise verify that the person has been issued any of those forms of picture identification. (4) If the person is operating a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State without a driver's license in violation of Section 56-1-20, the person may be arrested pursuant to Section 56-1-440. (5) If the person meets the presumption established pursuant to this subsection, the officer may not further stop, detain, investigate, or arrest the person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. (6) This section does not apply to a law enforcement officer who is acting as a school resource officer for any elementary or secondary school. (C)(1) If the person does not meet the presumption established pursuant to subsection (B), the officer shall make a reasonable effort, when practicable, to verify the person's lawful presence in the United States by at least one of the following methods: (a) contacting the Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit within the South Carolina Department of Public Safety; (b) submitting an Immigration Alien Query through the International Justice and Public Safety Network; (c) contacting the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Law Enforcement Support Center; or (d) contacting the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement's local field office. (2) The officer shall stop, detain, or investigate the person only for a reasonable amount of time as allowed by law. If, after making a reasonable effort, the officer is unable to verify the person's lawful presence in the United States by one of the methods described in item (1), the officer may not further stop, detain, investigate, or arrest the person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. (3) If the officer verifies that the person is lawfully present in the United States, the officer may not further stop, detain, investigate, or arrest the person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. (4) If the officer determines that the person is unlawfully present in the United States, the officer shall determine in cooperation with the Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit within the South Carolina Department of Public Safety or the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as applicable, whether the officer shall retain custody of the person for the underlying criminal offense for which the person was stopped, detained, investigated, or arrested, or whether the Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit within the South Carolina Department of Public Safety or the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as applicable, shall assume custody of the person. The officer is not required by this section to retain custody of the person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. The officer may securely transport the person to a federal facility in this State or to any other point of transfer into federal custody that is outside of the officer's jurisdiction. The officer shall obtain judicial authorization before securely transporting a person to a point of transfer that is outside of this State. (D) Nothing in this section must be construed to require a law enforcement officer to stop, detain, investigate, arrest, or confine a person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. A law enforcement officer may not attempt to make an independent judgment of a person's lawful presence in the United States. A law enforcement officer may not consider race, color, or national origin in implementing this section, except to the extent permitted by the United States or South Carolina Constitution. This section must be implemented in a manner that is consistent with federal laws regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens. (E) Except as provided by federal law, officers and agencies of this State and political subdivisions of this State may not be prohibited or restricted from sending, receiving, or maintaining information related to the immigration status of any person or exchanging that information with other federal, state, or local government entities for the following purposes: (1) determining eligibility for any public benefit, service, or license provided by the federal government, this State, or a political subdivision of this State; (2) verifying any claim of residence or domicile, if determination of residence or domicile is required under the laws of this State or a judicial order issued pursuant to a civil or criminal proceeding in this State; (3) determining whether an alien is in compliance with the federal registration laws prescribed by Chapter 7, Title II of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act; or (4) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 and 8 U.S.C. Section 1644. (F) Nothing in this section must be construed to deny a person bond or from being released from confinement when such person is otherwise eligible for release. However, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17-15-30, a court setting bond shall consider whether the person charged is an alien unlawfully present in the United States. (G) No official, agency, or political subdivision of this State may limit or restrict the enforcement of this section or federal immigration laws. (H) This section does not implement, authorize, or establish, and shall not be construed to implement, authorize, or establish the federal Real ID Act of 2005. (I) Any time a motor vehicle is stopped by a state or local law enforcement officer without a citation being issued or an arrest being made, and the officer contacts the Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit within the Department of Public Safety pursuant to this section, the officer who initiated the stop must complete a data collection form designed by the Department of Public Safety, which must include information regarding the age, gender, and race or ethnicity of the driver of the vehicle. This information may be gathered and transmitted electronically under the supervision of the Department of Public Safety, which shall develop and maintain a database storing the information collected. The Department of Public Safety must promulgate regulations with regard to the collection and submission of the information gathered. In addition, the Department of Public Safety shall prepare a report to be posted on the Department of Public Safety's website regarding motor vehicle stops using the collected information.
