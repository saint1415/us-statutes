The device must be capable of recording the person's location at all times. If the court orders a device, before the participant is allowed to leave custody, the detention facility where the defendant is located, in coordination with the approved monitoring agency, must ensure the participant is fitted with an approved active electronic monitoring device, and that all appropriate bond paperwork, including the agreement with the bonding and electronic monitoring companies acknowledging the terms and restrictions of the bond, is completed.\n\n(3) The participant who is ordered on supervision must:\n\n(a) wear an approved device at all times to verify his compliance with the conditions of his detention or if the device is not body worn, must maintain possession of his approved device on or near his person at all times for the duration of the detention and must verify his identity and location at any time required by the order of the court and must maintain the monitoring device on or near his person at all times for the duration of the detention, subject to the order of the court and reasonable orders of an agent or employee of the monitoring agency in order to effectuate the conditions of the monitoring order. For purposes of this subsection, \"near\" means within hearing distance of the device's notification or call alerts but not farther than thirty feet. In areas of the State where cellular coverage requires the use of an alternate device, the approved electronic monitoring company may use an alternate approved device with approval of the court;\n\n(b) charge and maintain the monitoring device in working order and must report any damage, destruction, or noticeable malfunction of the active monitoring device, whether the incident was accidental or intentional, and including the device having a dead battery, to at least one of the following parties within two hours of the incident: the monitoring agency, the appropriate law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the underlying offense, or any other party specified in the order;\n\n(c) abide by other terms and conditions set forth by the approved electronic monitoring agency with regard to the monitoring device and electronic monitoring program;\n\n(d) turn himself in to custody of the appropriate detention facility upon the order of the monitoring agency, or the appropriate law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the offense; and\n\n(e) pay for the cost of the approved active electronic monitoring device and the operation of the monitoring device for the duration of the time the person is required to be electronically monitored, subject to an order of indigency by the court. The summary court or circuit court has jurisdiction upon motion of the defendant to consider exempting a person from the payment of a part or all of the cost during a part or all of the duration of the time the person is required to be electronically monitored, if it is determined that exceptional circumstances exist such that these payments cause a severe hardship to the person who is deemed indigent. If the indigency hearing is held at a time and date separate from the initial bond hearing, the defense must notify the prosecutor, the bondsman, and the monitoring agency of the date, time, and location of the hearing subject to the notice requirements of the court.\n\nThe payment of the cost must be a condition of supervision of the person and a delinquency of two weeks or more in making payments may operate as a violation of a term or condition of the electronic monitoring and bond. No person shall be denied the privilege of electronic monitoring under this statute based on inability to pay upon a finding by the court that the defendant meets the qualifications for indigency. The State shall allocate funds to be housed in an indigency fund under the control of the Department of Public Safety to be distributed to the monitoring companies as appropriate to cover the cost of indigent participants.\n\n(C) A participant ordered by the court to be monitored under the provisions of this section, who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section or who fails to comply with any additional condition of the court order including location restrictions, may have his bond revoked or may be punished for contempt at the discretion of the court.\n\n(D) It is unlawful for any person, knowingly and without authority, to remove, tamper with, damage, destroy, shield the signal from, or otherwise circumvent an active electronic monitoring device, or to aid or assist a person ordered by the court to be electronically monitored under the provisions of this section to remove, tamper with, damage, destroy, shield the signal from, or otherwise circumvent a monitoring device and, upon conviction, the person must be punished under the provisions of Section 24-13-425. This subsection does not apply to a person or agent of the electronic monitoring agency or bonding company, or a member of law enforcement acting under the authority of and with compliance to the court order.\n\n(E)(1) Upon violation of any of these requirements and a showing by affidavit and supporting records by the electronic monitoring company on a domestic violence bond or general sessions bond or where emergency circumstances exist on any other bond, the approved electronic monitoring company may approach a summary court judge for a bench warrant if one is not already provided for in the bond paperwork or other court order. Law enforcement shall immediately attempt to locate and incarcerate the defendant upon notice of the bench warrant. After incarceration, the prosecutor must be notified and the defendant must be brought before a summary court judge within three calendar days or before a circuit court judge within three business days, whichever has jurisdiction of the underlying charge, to determine whether the bond is to be reconsidered or bond conditions amended. The prosecution must provide the defense with any relevant evidence regarding the alleged violation within a reasonable time before the hearing and the hearing may be continued for cause.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall reduce any duty of the bondsman to pick up the offending bailee and immediately incarcerate him for violation of bond conditions. Failure to do so may lead to bond estreatment for failure to enforce bond conditions by the bondsman and possible other administrative or criminal action.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section may be used to hold the electronic monitoring agency civilly liable for any criminal acts of the defendant committed while being monitored.\n\nHISTORY: 2023 Act No. 83 (H.3532), Section 4, eff December 20, 2023.",

Also, the circuit courts may consider motions regarding reconsideration of bond for general sessions offenses set by summary court judges upon motions filed with the clerks of court. Hearings on these motions must be scheduled. The rules of evidence do not apply to bond hearings.\n\n(2) After a circuit court judge has heard and ruled upon a defendant's motion to reconsider a bond set by a summary court judge, further defense motions to reconsider may be heard by the circuit court only upon the defendant's prima facie showing of a material change in circumstances which relate to the factors provided in Section 17-15-30, and which have arisen since the prior motion to reconsider. In addition, the circuit court may hear further defense motions to reconsider based on the length of time the defendant has been held for trial after six months. The chief judge shall schedule a hearing or if such showing is not set forth in the written motion, deny the motion for failure to make a prima facie showing of a material change in circumstances. A defendant shall be advised of his right to a speedy trial. Notwithstanding another provision of law, nothing prevents a solicitor or the defendant from filing a motion for a speedy trial or requesting the court to set a date certain for trial based on the facts and circumstances in the case. If either party fails to comply with the terms of an order granting a speedy trial, the court may reconsider the terms of the defendant's bond, may consider sanctions and may grant other just and proper relief as the court determines.\n\n(B)(1) Motions by the State to revoke or modify a bond must be made in writing, state with particularity the grounds for revocation or modification, and set forth the relief or order sought.

The chief judge shall schedule a hearing or if such showing is not set forth in the written motion, deny the motion for failure to make a prima facie showing of a material change in circumstances.\n\n(3) If the state's motion to revoke or modify bond includes a prima facie showing of imminent danger to the community, imminent danger to the defendant, or flight by the defendant, the chief judge or presiding judge shall conduct or order an emergency bond hearing to be conducted by the circuit court judge within forty-eight hours of receiving service of the state's motion or as soon as practical. The chief judge shall order the solicitor to notify the defense counsel of record and bond surety of the time and date of the hearing, and the solicitor shall provide proof that reasonable efforts were made to affect the notice. Upon notice by the State, the defense counsel of record and bond surety shall make reasonable efforts to notify the defendant of the emergency hearing. The court may proceed with the hearing despite the absence of the defendant or bond surety. The court may not proceed with the hearing if the defense counsel of record is not present. If an emergency bond hearing is held without the presence of the defendant and bond is revoked, the judge having heard the matter may conduct the hearing on the defendant's motion to reconsider the revocation. Defense motions to reconsider revocation must be filed with the clerk of court and served on the solicitor and bond surety.\n\n(C) If a person commits a violent offense, as defined in Section 16-1-60, or any felony offense involving a firearm, which was committed when the person was already out on bond for a previous violent offense or any felony offense involving a firearm and the subsequent offense did not arise out of the same series of events as the previous offense, then:\n\n(1) the bond for the original offense must be revoked by operation of law and a hearing for the subsequent violent offense or any felony offense involving a firearm must be held in the circuit court within thirty days;\n\n(2) during the bond hearing for the subsequent violent offense or felony offense involving a firearm, the court must issue findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing the revocation of bond for the original offense, whether a new bond is issued for the previous offense as well as if bond is appropriate for the subsequent violent offense or felony offense involving a firearm;\n\n(3) if the court finds that certain conditions of release on bond will ensure that the person is unlikely to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community and the person will abide by the terms of release on bond, the judge shall consider bond in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and set or amend bond accordingly. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17-15-15, any bond set for a violent offense or felony offense involving a firearm committed when the person was already out on bond for a previous violent offense or felony offense involving a firearm must be deposited to the court in cash or its equivalent in full, notwithstanding if posted by the person, his representative, or by a bond surety;\n\n(4) if the court finds no such conditions will ensure that the person is unlikely to flee or not pose a danger to the community, the court shall not set a bond for the instant offense and must revoke all previously set bonds; and\n\n(5) if a person commits a violent offense, as defined in Section 16-1-60, or felony offense involving a firearm which was committed when the person was already out on bond for a previous violent offense or felony offense involving a firearm, and the subsequent offense did not arise out of the same series of events as the previous offense, then the arresting law enforcement agency must transmit notice of the second arrest, implicating this subsection, to the solicitor of the circuit in which the offense was committed and the administrative chief judge of the circuit in which the offense was committed. The prosecuting agency must notify any victims of the initial or subsequent offenses pursuant to Chapter 3, Title 16 of any bond hearings.\n\n(D) If a person commits a violent offense, as defined in Section 16-1-60, or felony offense involving a firearm which was committed when the person was already out on bond for two or more previous separate violent offenses or felony offenses involving a firearm for which separate bonds were set, and the subsequent offense did not arise out of the same series of events as the two or more previous separate offenses, and the court determines that under the totality of the circumstances the previous bonds should not be revoked and another bond should be set, any bond set by the court must be deposited in full and may not be posted by any bond surety company.\n\n(E) Notwithstanding subsection (C)(2), if the original bond was set in another judicial circuit, that prosecution agency shall be notified of the revocation and any finding the court makes pursuant to this subsection. The prosecution agency having jurisdiction over the subsequent charge must make the notification required in this subsection within forty-eight hours of the conclusion of the preceding. The presiding judge has jurisdiction to make a finding on record to deny a new bond on the original charge or may order a new bond hearing to be scheduled on the original charge in the judicial circuit where the charges are pending. This hearing must be scheduled within thirty days by the prosecution agency having jurisdiction over the original charges.\n\n(F) For the purpose of bond revocation only, a summary court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court for thirty days from the date bond is first set on a charge by the summary court or the date of the grand jury indictment whichever occurs first to determine if bond should be revoked.\n\nHISTORY: 2012 Act No. 286, Section 2, eff June 29, 2012; 2014 Act No. 144 (S.19), Section 1, eff April 7, 2014; 2015 Act No. 58 (S.3), Pt III, Section 15, eff June 4, 2015; 2023 Act No. 83 (H.3532), Section 6, eff June 20, 2023.",
