The magistrate must direct the arrest warrant either to the sheriff of the county or to a special constable commanding the defendant to be arrested and brought before him to be dealt with according to law and may issue a search warrant in which the premises in question must be particularly described, commanding the sheriff or constable to search thoroughly the premises in question and to seize all alcoholic liquors found thereon, to seize all vessels, bar fixtures, screens, bottles, glasses, and appurtenances apparently used or suitable for use in retailing liquors, and to make a complete inventory thereof and deposit it with the sheriff. Liquors so seized must, if no action to recover them is begun within thirty days after the seizure or if an action is begun and the judgment of the court is adverse to the plaintiff, be destroyed publicly by the sheriff of the county.

The circuit judge must grant the restraining order or injunction without requiring a bond or undertaking upon the hearing or receipt by him of the magistrate court papers from the solicitor. A violation of the restraining order or injunction is considered a contempt of court and punishable as contempt by the court or another circuit judge, as for the violation of an order or injunction.

In contempt proceedings arising out of the violation of an injunction granted under the provisions of this chapter, the court or, in vacation, any judge thereof has power to try summarily and punish the party guilty as required by law. The affidavits upon which the attachment for contempt issues are prima facie evidence for the State. At the hearing upon the charge for contempt, evidence may be oral or in the form of affidavits, or both. The defendant shall not necessarily be discharged upon his denial of the fact stated in the moving papers. The clerk of court must, upon the application of either party, issue subpoenas for witnesses and, except as provided in this section, the practice in these contempt proceedings must conform as nearly as possible to the practice in the court of common pleas.

The Attorney General may, in his discretion, cause a prosecution to be instituted not only in the matter neglected but also against the solicitor for malfeasance or misfeasance in office, for official misconduct, or for other charges justified by facts, and may pursue the prosecution to the extent of a conviction and dismissal from office of the solicitor. In this event, the Attorney General may appoint one or more additional assistants who must each receive while actually employed the same compensation, to be paid from the litigation fund of the Attorney General. Any duty imposed in this chapter upon a solicitor may be performed by the Attorney General or other person authorized by him to perform the duty. HISTORY: 1996 Act No. 415, Section 1.",
