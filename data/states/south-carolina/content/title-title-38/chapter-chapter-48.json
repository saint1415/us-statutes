A public insurance adjuster is not an attorney licensed to practice by the South Carolina Supreme Court who adjusts insurance losses in the course of the practice of law. A public insurance adjuster is not an adjuster representing an insurer and is not licensed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 47.\n\n(2) \"Public adjusting\" means investigating, appraising or evaluating, and reporting to an insured in relation to a first party claim arising under insurance contracts, that insure the real or personal property, or both, of the insured. Public adjusting does not include acting in any manner in relation to claims for damages to or arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Public adjusting does not include any activities which may constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as permitting the unauthorized practice of law.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 380, Section 1.",

These individuals shall apply for a license on a form prescribed by the director or his designee. The written examination for a public adjuster license shall be the same as that prescribed for insurance adjusters. The director or his designee shall satisfy himself that each applicant for a public adjuster's license is an individual of good moral character, has sufficient knowledge of the insurance business and duties as a public adjuster, has not violated the insurance laws of the State, and is a fit and proper individual for the position. No license may be issued pursuant to reciprocal arrangements or agreements as provided in Section 38-48-40 to a nonresident public adjuster who resides in a state which has enacted a statute requiring the licensing of public adjusters and which refuses to license South Carolina public adjusters; however, a license may be issued to such applicants upon a successful completion of the examination for public adjusters prescribed by the director or his designee. Only licensed public adjusters may solicit business from an insured who has sustained an insured loss. Individuals engaged in providing public adjusting services without a license shall be deemed to be engaged in unauthorized transaction of insurance business and subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 25, as well as the disgorgement of fees or restitution to the insured for any fees paid.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 380, Section 1.",
