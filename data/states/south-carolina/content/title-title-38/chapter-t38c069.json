If replacement of an annuity contract is involved, the contract holder is permitted to return the contract within twenty days of its delivery to the contract holder. If the contract was solicited by a direct response insurer rather than through a licensed insurance agent, the provision must state that the contract holder is permitted to return the contract within thirty-one days. The entire premium paid by the contract holder must be returned immediately to the contract holder; (3) a provision stating who is authorized by the insurer to waive, alter, or change any of the terms or conditions of the contract. It may state also that no agent has the power or authority to waive, change, or alter any of the terms or conditions of the policy; (4) a provision that the contract and any rider or supplemental benefits attached to the contract are incontestable as to the truth of the application for insurance and to the representations of the insured individual after they have been in force for two years from their date of issue. Any rider or supplemental benefits attached subsequently to the contract are incontestable as to the truth of the application for the rider or supplemental benefits and to the representations of the insured individual after they have been in force for two years from their date of issue. If an insurer institutes proceedings to vacate a contract on the ground of the falsity of the representations contained in the application for the contract, the proceedings must commence within the time permitted in this subsection; (5) a provision that if it is found that the age or sex of the insured, or of any individual considered in determining the premium, has been misstated, any amount payable or benefit accruing under the contract is that as the premium would have purchased according to the correct age or sex; (6) a provision stating how the beneficiary is designated and how the beneficiary may be changed; (7) there must be a provision stating the amount of premium and the time and manner payable; (8) a provision that the insured is entitled to a grace period of not less than thirty-one days within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made. During the grace period, the contract continues in full force. If a claim arises under the contract during the grace period, the amount of any premium due or overdue may be deducted from any amount payable under the contract in settlement; (9) a provision that the contract may be reinstated upon written application at any time within three years from the date of default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, unless the cash surrender value has been paid. However, all overdue stipulated payments and indebtedness to the insurer on the contract must be paid or reinstated with interest thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract, but not exceeding eight percent a year compounded annually and, when applicable, the insurer may include also a requirement of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer; (10) a provision if the annuity contract is participating, that beginning not later than the end of the third contract year, the insurer shall ascertain annually and apportion any divisible surplus accruing on the contract; (11) a provision that is in accordance with Article 5, Chapter 69, Title 38, Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities. The director or his designee may approve contracts with provisions which vary from the provisions required in this section if the provisions are more favorable to the insured. Any of the provisions not applicable to single premium annuities, flexible premium annuities, or single premium pure endowment contracts need not be incorporated to that extent in the contract.

(b) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that, upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the insurer will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of the amount as is specified in Sections 38-69-250, 38-69-260, 38-69-270, 38-69-280, and 38-69-300.

(c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of these benefits. (d) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract, any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, any deferred annuity contract may provide that, if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to that period would be less than twenty dollars monthly, the insurer may at its option terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of that portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit. This payment relieves the insurer of any further obligation under the contract.

This section does not apply to a contract issued after June 30, 2007.

(C) With respect to a contract providing for flexible considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or before the commencement of an annuity payment is equal to an accumulation up to that time at a rate of interest of three percent a year of percentages of the net considerations paid before that time, decreased by the sum of: (1) any previous withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of three percent a year; and (2) the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. (D) The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount must be an amount not less than zero and are equal to the corresponding gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of thirty dollars and less a collection charge of one dollar and twenty-five cents for each consideration credited to the contract during that contract year. The percentages of net considerations are sixty-five percent of the net consideration for the first contract year and eighty-seven and one-half percent of the net considerations for the second and later contract years. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, the percentage is sixty-five percent of the portion of the total net consideration for any renewal contract year which exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all previous contract years for which the percentage was sixty-five percent. (E) With respect to a contract providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts are calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and are defined as for contracts with flexible considerations which are paid annually with two exceptions: (1) the portion of the net consideration for the first contract year to be accumulated is the sum of sixty-five percent of the net consideration for the first contract year plus twenty-two and one-half percent of the excess of the net consideration for the first contract year over the lesser of the net considerations for the second and third contract years; (2) the annual contract charge is the lesser of: (a) thirty dollars; or (b) ten percent of the gross annual considerations. (F) With respect to a contract providing for a single consideration, minimum nonforfeiture amounts are defined as for contracts with flexible considerations except that the percentage of net consideration used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount is equal to ninety percent and the net consideration is the gross consideration less a contract charge of seventy-five dollars.
