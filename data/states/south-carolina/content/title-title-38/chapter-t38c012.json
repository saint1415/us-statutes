The existence of credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees or support features such as swap agreements do not cause a security or other instrument to be ineligible as an asset-backed security. (8) \"Business entity\" means a sole proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, association, general or limited partnership, joint stock company, joint venture, mutual fund, bank, trust, real estate investment trust, joint tenancy, or other similar form of business organization, whether organized for-profit or not-for-profit.

The prepayment expectation used in this calculation must be, at the insurer's election, the prepayment expectation for pass-through securities of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Government National Mortgage Association, or for other assets of the same type as the assets that underlie the asset-backed security, in either case with a gross weighted average coupon comparable to the gross weighted average coupon of the assets that underlie the asset-backed security; or (ii) another prepayment threshold assumption specified by the director by regulation promulgated pursuant to Section 12-38-90. (B) For purposes of subsubitem (2), if the asset-backed security is purchased in combination with one or more other asset-backed securities that are supported by identical underlying collateral, the insurer may calculate the rate of return for these specific combined asset-backed securities in combination. The insurer shall maintain documentation demonstrating that the securities were acquired and continue to be held in combination.

Investments not conforming to this chapter are not admitted assets unless they are acquired pursuant to other authority of this title. (B) Subject to subsection (C), an insurer may not acquire or hold an investment as an admitted asset unless at the time of acquisition it is: (1) eligible for the payment or accrual of interest or discount, whether in cash, securities, or other forms of income, or eligible to receive dividends or other distributions, or is otherwise income producing; or (2) acquired pursuant to Sections 38-12-270(C), 38-12-280, 38-12-300, 38-12-320, 38-12-480(C), 38-12-490, 38-12-510, 38-12-520, or other sections of this title. (C) An insurer may acquire or hold as admitted assets investments that otherwise do not qualify as provided in this chapter if the insurer has not acquired them for the purpose of circumventing a limitation contained in this chapter, if the insurer complies with the provisions of Sections 38-12-60 and 38-12-80 as to the investments and the insurer acquires the investments: (1) as payment on account of existing indebtedness or in connection with the refinancing, restructuring, or workout of existing indebtedness, if taken to protect the insurer's interest in that investment; (2) as realization on collateral for an obligation; (3) in connection with an otherwise qualified investment or investment practice, as interest on or a dividend or other distribution related to the investment or investment practice, or in connection with the refinancing of the investment, in each case for no additional or only nominal consideration; (4) under a lawful and bona fide agreement of recapitalization or voluntary or involuntary reorganization in connection with an investment held by the insurer; or (5) under a bulk reinsurance, merger, or consolidation transaction approved by the director if the assets constitute admissible investments for the ceding, merged, or consolidated companies. (D) An investment or portion of an investment acquired by an insurer pursuant to subsection (C) becomes a nonadmitted asset three years, or five years in the case of mortgage loans and real estate, from the date of its acquisition, unless within that period the investment has become a qualified investment pursuant to a provision of this chapter other than subsection (C). An investment acquired pursuant to an agreement of bulk reinsurance, merger, or consolidation may be qualified for a longer period if provided in the plan for reinsurance, merger, or consolidation as approved by the director. The director may extend the period for admissibility for an additional reasonable period, upon application by the insurer and a showing that the nonadmission of an asset held pursuant to subsection (C) would injure materially the interests of the insurer. (E) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (F) and (H), an investment qualifies pursuant to this chapter if, on the date the insurer committed to acquire the investment or on the date of its acquisition, it would have qualified pursuant to this chapter. For purposes of determining its compliance with the limitations contained in this chapter, an insurer shall give appropriate recognition to any commitments to acquire investments. (F)(1) An investment held as an admitted asset by an insurer on the effective date of this chapter which qualified as an admitted asset immediately before the effective date of this chapter remains qualified as an admitted asset pursuant to this chapter. (2) Each specific transaction constituting an investment practice of the type described in this chapter that lawfully was entered into by an insurer and was in effect on the effective date of this chapter continues to be permitted by this chapter until its expiration or termination under its terms. (G) Unless otherwise specified, an investment limitation computed on the basis of the admitted assets or capital and surplus of an insurer must relate to the amount required to be shown on the statutory balance sheet most recently required to be filed by the insurer with the director. For purposes of determining its compliance with any limitation pursuant to this chapter based upon admitted assets, the insurer shall deduct from the amount of its admitted assets the amount of the liability recorded on the statutory balance sheet for: (1) the return of acceptable collateral received in a reverse repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction; (2) cash received in a dollar roll transaction; and (3) the amount reported as borrowed money in the most recently filed financial statement to the extent not included in items (1) and (2). (H) An investment qualified, in whole or in part, for acquisition or holding as an admitted asset may be qualified or requalified at the time of acquisition or a later date, in whole or in part, pursuant to another section, if the relevant conditions contained in the other section are satisfied at the time of qualification or requalification. (I) An insurer shall maintain documentation demonstrating that the insurer acquired investments and engaged in investment practices in accordance with this chapter, and specifying the section of this chapter pursuant to which the insurer acquired the investments or engaged in the investment practices. (J) An insurer may not enter into an agreement to purchase securities in advance of their issuance for resale to the public as part of a distribution of the securities by the issuer or otherwise guarantee the distribution, except that an insurer may acquire privately placed securities with registration rights. (K) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the director, for good cause, may require an insurer to nonadmit, limit, dispose of, withdraw from, or discontinue an investment or investment practice. The authority of the director under this subsection is in addition to any other authority of the director. HISTORY: 2002 Act No. 319, Section 2, eff June 3, 2002.",

      "text": "(A)(1) In connection with mortgage loans, an insurer: (a) may acquire obligations secured by mortgages on real estate situated within a domestic jurisdiction, subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-220, either directly or indirectly through: (i) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (ii) joint ventures; (iii) stock of an investment affiliate; (iv) membership interests in a limited liability company; (v) trust certificates; or (vi) other similar instruments; and (b) may not acquire a mortgage loan secured by other than a first lien pursuant to this item unless the insurer is the holder of the first lien. The obligations held by the insurer and obligations with an equal lien priority, at the time of acquisition of the obligation, may not exceed: (i) ninety percent of the fair market value of the real estate, if the mortgage loan is secured by a purchase money mortgage or like security received by the insurer upon disposition of the real estate; (ii) eighty percent of the fair market value of the real estate, if the mortgage loan requires immediate scheduled payment in periodic installments of principal and interest over an amortization period of thirty years or less, and periodic payments are required at least annually. Each periodic payment must be sufficient to ensure that at all times the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan is not greater than the outstanding principal balance that would be outstanding pursuant to a mortgage loan with the same original principal balance and the same interest rate and requiring equal payments of principal and interest with the same frequency over the same amortization period. Mortgage loans that otherwise are permitted pursuant to this subsection may provide for a payment of the principal balance before the end of the period of amortization of the loan. For residential mortgage loans, the eighty percent limitation may be increased to ninety-seven percent if acceptable private mortgage insurance has been obtained; or (iii) seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the real estate for mortgage loans that do not meet the requirements of subsubitems (i) or (ii). (2) For purposes of item (1), the amount of an obligation required to be included in the calculation of the loan-to-value ratio may be reduced to the extent the obligation is insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, or their successors. (3)(a) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-220, an insurer may acquire obligations secured by a second mortgage on real estate situated within a domestic jurisdiction, in addition to that which is authorized under item (1), either directly or indirectly through: (i) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (ii) joint ventures; (iii) stock of an investment affiliate; (iv) membership interests in a limited liability company; (v) trust certificates; or (vi) other similar instruments. (b) The obligation held by the insurer must be the sole second lien priority obligation and, at the time of acquisition of the obligation, may not exceed seventy percent of the amount by which the fair market value of the real estate exceeds the amount outstanding under the first mortgage. (4) A mortgage loan that is held by an insurer pursuant to Section 38-12-40(F) or acquired pursuant to this section and is restructured in a manner that meets the requirements of a restructured mortgage loan in accordance with the NAIC accounting manual continues to qualify as a mortgage loan pursuant to this chapter. (5) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-220, a credit lease transaction that does not qualify for investment pursuant to Section 38-12-230 is exempt from the provisions of item (1) if: (a) the loan amortizes over the initial fixed lease term in an amount at least sufficient so that the loan balance at the end of the lease term does not exceed the original appraised value of the real estate; (b) the lease payments cover or exceed the total debt service over the life of the loan; (c) a tenant or its affiliated entity whose rated credit instruments have a SVO 1 or 2 designation or a comparable rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization recognized by the SVO has a full faith and credit obligation to make the lease payments; (d) the insurer holds or is the beneficial holder of a first lien mortgage on the real estate; (e) the expenses of the real estate are passed through to the tenant, excluding exterior, structural, parking, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning replacement expenses, unless annual escrow contributions, from cash flows derived from the lease payments, cover the expense shortfall; and (f) there is a perfected assignment of the rents due pursuant to the lease to or for the benefit of the insurer. (B)(1) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-220 an insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate situated in a domestic jurisdiction, either directly or indirectly, through: (a) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (b) joint ventures; (c) stock of an investment affiliate; (d) membership interests in a limited liability company; (e) trust certificates; or (f) other similar instruments. (2) The real estate must be income producing or intended for improvement or development for investment purposes under an existing program, in which case the real estate is considered to be income producing. The real estate may be subject to mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances, the amount of which must be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer for purposes of determining compliance with items (2) and (3) of subsection (D). (C) An insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate for the convenient accommodation of the business operations, including home office, branch office, and field office operations of the insurer or its affiliates. (1) Real estate acquired pursuant to this subsection may include excess space for rent to others, if the excess space when valued at its fair market value, would otherwise be a permitted investment pursuant to subsection (B) and is so qualified by the insurer. (2) The real estate acquired pursuant to this subsection may be subject to one or more mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances, the amount of which must be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer for purposes of determining compliance with subsection (D)(4). (3) For purposes of this subsection, business operations do not include that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services by an accident and health insurer for its insureds, other than employees of the insurer and its affiliates and their families. An insurer may acquire real estate used for these purposes pursuant to subsection (B). (D) An insurer may not acquire: (1) an investment pursuant to subsection (A) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (A) exceeds: (a) one percent of its admitted assets in mortgage loans covering any one secured location; (b) one quarter of one percent of its admitted assets in construction loans covering any one secured location; or (c) two percent of its admitted assets in construction loans in the aggregate; (2) an investment pursuant to subsection (B) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any outstanding guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (B), plus the guarantees then outstanding, exceeds: (a) one percent of its admitted assets in any one parcel or group of contiguous parcels of real estate, except that this limitation does not apply to that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services by an accident and health insurer for its insureds, such as hospitals, medical clinics, medical professional buildings, or other health facilities used for the purpose of providing health services; or (b) fifteen percent of its admitted assets in the aggregate, but not more than five percent of its admitted assets as to properties that are to be improved or developed; (3) an investment pursuant to subsection (A) or (B) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsections (A) and (B), plus the guarantees then outstanding, exceeds forty-five percent of its admitted assets. An insurer may exceed this limitation by not more than thirty percent of its admitted assets if: (a) this increased amount is invested only in residential mortgage loans; (b) the insurer has no more than ten percent of its admitted assets invested in mortgage loans other than residential mortgage loans; (c) the loan-to-value ratio of each residential mortgage loan does not exceed sixty percent at the time the mortgage loan is qualified pursuant to this increased authority and the fair market value is supported by an independent appraisal no more than two years old; (d) a single mortgage loan qualified pursuant to this increased authority may not exceed one-half of one percent of its admitted assets; (e) the insurer files with the director, and receives approval for, a plan that is designed to result in a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that is sufficiently geographically diversified; and (f) the insurer agrees to file annually with the director records that demonstrate that its portfolio of residential mortgage loans is geographically diversified in accordance with the plan; or (4) real estate pursuant to subsection (C) if as a result of and after giving effect to the acquisition the aggregate amount of real estate then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (C) exceeds ten percent of its admitted assets. Additional amounts of real estate may be acquired, with the permission of the director, pursuant to subsection (C). The limitations of Section 38-12-220 do not apply to an insurer's acquisition of real estate pursuant to subsection (C). HISTORY: 2002 Act No. 319, Section 2, eff June 3, 2002.",

      "text": "(A)(1) Pursuant to this subsection, an insurer may acquire an investment of any kind, or engage in a securities lending transaction, repurchase transaction, reverse repurchase transaction, or dollar roll transaction, that is not prohibited specifically by this chapter, without regard to the categories, conditions, standards, or other limitations of Sections 38-12-220 through 38-12-290 if, as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction, the aggregate amount of investments then held and securities lending transactions, repurchase transactions, reverse repurchase transactions, and dollar roll transactions then engaged in pursuant to this subsection does not exceed the lesser of: (a) ten percent of its admitted assets; or (b) seventy-five percent of its capital and surplus; (2) An insurer may not acquire an investment or engage in an investment practice pursuant to this subsection if as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer under this subsection in any one person exceeds three percent of its admitted assets. (B) In addition to the investments acquired pursuant to subsection (A) of this section, an insurer may acquire an investment of any kind, or engage in investment practices described in Section 38-12-280, that are not prohibited by this chapter without regard to any limitations of Sections 38-12-220 through 38-12-290 if: (1) the director grants prior approval; (2) the insurer demonstrates that its investments are made in a prudent manner and that the additional amounts will be invested in a prudent manner; and (3) as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction, the aggregate amount of investments then held by the insurer pursuant to this subsection does not exceed the greater of: (a) twenty-five percent of its capital and surplus; or (b) one hundred percent of capital and surplus less ten percent of its admitted assets. (C) This section does not permit an insurer to acquire an investment or engage in an investment practice that is prohibited pursuant to Section 38-12-60, or that is a derivative transaction. (D) If any investment made or transaction entered into pursuant to any other section of this chapter exceeds the limits specified in that section, the excess portion of the investment or transaction is considered to be an investment or transaction pursuant to this section. Any loan, investment, or transaction originally made pursuant to this section which subsequently, if it were then being made, would qualify as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to another subsection of this section or another section of this chapter shall thereafter be considered an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to that subsection or section. (E) This chapter does not prohibit the acquisition by an insurer of additional obligations, securities, or other assets if received as a dividend or as a distribution of assets, nor does this chapter apply to securities, obligations, or other assets accepted incident to the workout, adjustment, restructuring, or similar realization of an investment or transaction when the insurer's board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors considers it to be in the best interests of the insurer, if the investment or transaction had been authorized previously. This chapter does not apply to assets acquired pursuant to a lawful agreement of bulk reinsurance if the assets constituted legal and authorized investments for the ceding company. No obligation, security, or other asset acquired as authorized by this subsection is required to be qualified pursuant to any other subsection of this section or other section of this chapter, provided that all assets acquired pursuant to this subsection are subject to the applicable accounting and valuation requirements contained in this chapter. (F) Subject to the provisions of subsection (G), if a domestic life insurance company, pursuant to a merger or consolidation, acquires an investment or transaction that was an authorized investment or transaction of the company that was merged or consolidated with the domestic life insurance company but that does not qualify as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this chapter at the time the merger or consolidation occurs, regardless of whether or not the investment or transaction would be authorized pursuant to any of subsections (A) through (C), then the investment or transaction is considered an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection and is not required to be applied toward the limitations contained in any of subsections (A) through (C), for a period of five years after the date on which the merger or consolidation occurs. After that period it shall no longer be an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection, unless within the five-year period: (1) the investment or transaction qualifies as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to another subsection of this section or another section of this chapter including without limitation, subsections (A), (B), and (C), if the domestic life insurance company so elects; or (2) the director authorizes the investment or transaction in the plan of merger or consolidation approved by the director; or (3) upon request of the insurer, the director authorizes an extension of the five-year time period; or (4) the director approves the investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection. The aggregate amount of a domestic life insurance company's investments and transactions pursuant to this subsection, excluding investments and transactions authorized pursuant to items (1), (2), and (4), may not exceed twenty-five percent of the domestic life insurance company's capital and surplus after giving effect to such merger or consolidation. (G) If a domestic life insurance company, pursuant to a merger or consolidation, acquires a mortgage loan, or a participation in a mortgage loan, that would have been authorized pursuant to Section 38-12-270, and pursuant to subsection (D) of this section as to the portion that exceeded seventy-five percent of the value of the property, at the time the company that was merged or consolidated with such domestic life insurance company invested in the mortgage loan or the participation in the mortgage loan, then such mortgage loan or participation in the mortgage loan is authorized pursuant to Section 38-12-270, and pursuant to subsection (D) of this section as to the portion that exceeded seventy-five percent of the value of the property. (H) The director has full discretion in selecting a method for calculating values of investments and transactions that an insurer acquires through a merger or consolidation, provided that the method is consistent with any applicable provisions of this chapter and any applicable valuation method that the NAIC is currently using at the time with respect to investments and transactions. If there is a conflict between a provision of this chapter and the NAIC valuation method being used, the provision of this chapter controls. (I) The qualification or disqualification of an investment pursuant to one subsection of this section or one section of this chapter does not prevent its qualification in whole or in part pursuant to another provision of this chapter. An investment authorized by more than one provision of this chapter is authorized pursuant to the provision the insurer elects. An investment or transaction qualified pursuant to any provision of this chapter at the time it was acquired or entered into by the insurer shall continue to be qualified pursuant to that provision. An investment or transaction may be transferred in whole or in part at the election of the insurer to the authority of any provision of this chapter pursuant to which it then qualifies, whether or not it originally qualified pursuant to that provision. (J) Notwithstanding the provisions of the other subsections of this section or the other sections of this chapter, an insurer may acquire an investment in or enter into a transaction with a business entity in which the insurer already holds one or more investments or with which the insurer has entered into one or more transactions if the investment is acquired or the transaction is entered into in order to protect an investment or transaction previously made in or with the business entity, provided that the aggregate amount of investments and transactions so acquired and entered into may not exceed five percent of the insurer's capital and surplus. (K)(1) The percentage authorizations and limitations contained in any provision of this chapter apply only at the time of the original acquisition of an investment or at the time a transaction is entered into and are not applicable to the insurer or the investment or transaction after that time except as provided in subsection (I). Once any investment or transaction is qualified pursuant to any provision of this chapter, it shall remain qualified notwithstanding any refinancing, restructuring, or modification of the investment or transaction, provided that the insurer does not engage in the refinancing, restructuring, or modification of the investment or transaction for the purposes of circumventing the requirements or limitations of this chapter. (2) The director has full discretion to value investments and transactions that an insurer holds at the time of an examination of the insurer using a method of calculating the values that the director selects in his discretion, provided that the method must be consistent with any applicable provisions of this chapter and any applicable valuation method that the NAIC is using at the time with respect to investments and transactions. If there is a conflict between such a provision of this chapter and an applicable NAIC valuation method that the NAIC is using at the time, the provision of this chapter controls. (3) Notwithstanding items (1) and (2), if the director determines that the continued operation of an insurer may be hazardous to its policyholders, its creditors, or the general public, the director may issue an order consistent with applicable statutes requiring the insurer to limit or withdraw from certain investments or transactions or discontinue certain practices as to investments or transactions to the extent the director considers necessary.

      "text": "(A)(1) In connection with mortgage loans, an insurer: (a) may acquire obligations secured by mortgages on real estate situated within a domestic jurisdiction, subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-430, either directly or indirectly through: (i) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (ii) joint ventures; (iii) stock of an investment affiliate; (iv) membership interests in a limited liability company; (v) trust certificates; or (vi) other similar instruments; and (b) may not acquire a mortgage loan secured by other than a first lien pursuant to this item unless the insurer is the holder of the first lien. The obligations held by the insurer and obligations with an equal lien priority, at the time of acquisition of the obligation, may not exceed: (i) ninety percent of the fair market value of the real estate, if the mortgage loan is secured by a purchase money mortgage or like security received by the insurer upon disposition of the real estate; (ii) eighty percent of the fair market value of the real estate, if the mortgage loan requires immediate scheduled payment in periodic installments of principal and interest over an amortization period of thirty years or less, and periodic payments are required at least annually. Each periodic payment must be sufficient to ensure that at all times the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan is not greater than the outstanding principal balance that would be outstanding pursuant to a mortgage loan with the same original principal balance and the same interest rate and requiring equal payments of principal and interest with the same frequency over the same amortization period. Mortgage loans that otherwise are permitted pursuant to this subsection may provide for a payment of the principal balance before the end of the period of amortization of the loan. For residential mortgage loans, the eighty percent limitation may be increased to ninety-seven percent if acceptable private mortgage insurance has been obtained; or (iii) seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the real estate for mortgage loans that do not meet the requirements of subsubitem (i) or (ii). (2) For purposes of item (1), the amount of an obligation required to be included in the calculation of the loan-to-value ratio may be reduced to the extent the obligation is insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, or their successors. (3)(a) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-430, an insurer may acquire obligations secured by a second mortgage on real estate situated within a domestic jurisdiction, in addition to that which is authorized under item (1), either directly or indirectly through: (i) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (ii) joint ventures; (iii) stock of an investment affiliate; (iv) membership interests in a limited liability company; (v) trust certificates; or (vi) other similar instruments. (b) The obligation held by the insurer must be the sole second lien priority obligation and, at the time of acquisition of the obligation, may not exceed seventy percent of the amount by which the fair market value of the real estate exceeds the amount outstanding under the first mortgage. (4) A mortgage loan that is held by an insurer pursuant to Section 38-12-40(F) or acquired pursuant to this section and is restructured in a manner that meets the requirements of a restructured mortgage loan in accordance with the NAIC accounting manual continues to qualify as a mortgage loan pursuant to this chapter. (5) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-430, a credit lease transaction that does not qualify for investment pursuant to Section 38-12-440 is exempt from the provisions of item (1) if: (a) the loan amortizes over the initial fixed lease term in an amount at least sufficient so that the loan balance at the end of the lease term does not exceed the original appraised value of the real estate; (b) the lease payments cover or exceed the total debt service over the life of the loan; (c) a tenant or its affiliated entity whose rated credit instruments have a SVO 1 or 2 designation or a comparable rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization recognized by the SVO has a full faith and credit obligation to make the lease payments; (d) the insurer holds or is the beneficial holder of a first lien mortgage on the real estate; (e) the expenses of the real estate are passed through to the tenant, excluding exterior, structural, parking, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning replacement expenses, unless annual escrow contributions, from cash flows derived from the lease payments, cover the expense shortfall; and (f) there is a perfected assignment of the rents due pursuant to the lease to or for the benefit of the insurer. (B)(1) Subject to the limitations of Section 38-12-430, an insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate situated in a domestic jurisdiction, either directly or indirectly, through: (a) limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by Section 38-12-60(A)(4); (b) joint ventures; (c) stock of an investment affiliate; (d) membership interests in a limited liability company; (e) trust certificates; or (f) other similar instruments. (2) The real estate must be income producing or intended for improvement or development for investment purposes under an existing program, in which case the real estate is considered to be income producing. The real estate may be subject to mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances, the amount of which must be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer for purposes of determining compliance with items (2) and (3) of subsection (D). (C) An insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate for the convenient accommodation of the business operations, including home office, branch office, and field office operations of the insurer or its affiliates. (1) Real estate acquired pursuant to this subsection may include excess space for rent to others, if the excess space when valued at its fair market value, would otherwise be a permitted investment pursuant to subsection (B) and is so qualified by the insurer. (2) The real estate acquired pursuant to this subsection may be subject to one or more mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances, the amount of which must be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer for purposes of determining compliance with subsection (D)(4). (3) For purposes of this subsection, business operations do not include that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services for its insureds, other than employees of the insurer and its affiliates and their families, by an insurer whose insurance premiums and required statutory reserves for accident and health insurance are at least ninety-five percent of total premium consideration or total statutory required reserves, respectively. An insurer may acquire real estate used for these purposes pursuant to subsection (B). (D) An insurer may not acquire: (1) an investment pursuant to subsection (A) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (A) exceeds: (a) one percent of its admitted assets in mortgage loans covering any one secured location; (b) one quarter of one percent of its admitted assets in construction loans covering any one secured location; or (c) one percent of its admitted assets in construction loans in the aggregate; (2) an investment pursuant to subsection (B) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any outstanding guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (B), plus the guarantees then outstanding, exceeds: (a) one percent of its admitted assets in any one parcel or group of contiguous parcels of real estate, except that this limitation does not apply to that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services by an insurer whose insurance premiums and required statutory reserves for accident and health insurance are at least ninety-five percent of total premium consideration or total statutory required reserves, respectively, such as hospitals, medical clinics, medical professional buildings, or other health facilities used for the purpose of providing health services; or (b) the lesser of ten percent of its admitted assets or forty percent of its surplus as regards policyholders in the aggregate, except that for an insurer whose insurance premiums and required statutory reserves for accident and health insurance are at least ninety-five percent of total premium consideration or total statutory required reserves, respectively, this limitation must be increased to fifteen percent of its admitted assets in the aggregate; (3) an investment pursuant to subsection (A) or (B) if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer pursuant to subsections (A) and (B), plus the guarantees then outstanding, exceeds twenty-five percent of its admitted assets; or (4) real estate pursuant to subsection (C) if as a result of and after giving effect to the acquisition the aggregate amount of real estate then held by the insurer pursuant to subsection (C) exceeds ten percent of its admitted assets. Additional amounts of real estate may be acquired, with the permission of the director, pursuant to subsection (C). The limitations of Section 38-12-430 do not apply to an insurer's acquisition of real estate pursuant to subsection (C). HISTORY: 2002 Act No. 319, Section 2, eff June 3, 2002.",

      "text": "(A) Pursuant to this subsection, an insurer may acquire an investment of any kind, or engage in a securities lending transaction, repurchase transaction, reverse repurchase transaction, or dollar roll transaction, that is not prohibited specifically by this chapter, without regard to the categories, conditions, standards, or other limitation of Sections 38-12-430 through 38-12-500 if, as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction, the aggregate amount of investments then held and securities lending transactions, repurchase transactions, reverse repurchase transactions, and dollar roll transactions then engaged in pursuant to this subsection does not exceed the greater of: (1) its unrestricted surplus; or (2) ten percent of its admitted assets or fifty percent of its surplus as regards policyholders, whichever is less. (B) An insurer may not acquire an investment or engage in an investment practice pursuant to this subsection if as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer under this subsection in any one person exceed five percent of its admitted assets. (C) If any investment made or transaction entered into pursuant to any other section of this chapter exceeds the limits specified in that section, the excess portion of the investment or transaction is considered to be an investment or transaction pursuant to this section. Any loan, investment, or transaction originally made pursuant to this section which subsequently, if it were then being made, would qualify as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to another subsection of this section or another section of this chapter shall thereafter be considered an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to that subsection or section. (D) This chapter does not prohibit the acquisition by an insurer of additional obligations, securities, or other assets if received as a dividend or as a distribution of assets, nor does this chapter apply to securities, obligations, or other assets accepted incident to the workout, adjustment, restructuring, or similar realization of an investment or transaction when the insurer's board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors considers it to be in the best interests of the insurer, if the investment or transaction had been authorized previously. This chapter does not apply to assets acquired pursuant to a lawful agreement of bulk reinsurance if the assets constituted legal and authorized investments for the ceding company. No obligation, security, or other asset acquired as authorized by this subsection is required to be qualified pursuant to any other subsection of this section or other section of this chapter, provided that all assets acquired pursuant to this subsection are subject to the applicable accounting and valuation requirements contained in this chapter. (E) Subject to the provisions of subsection (F), if a domestic property and casualty insurance company, pursuant to a merger or consolidation, acquires an investment or transaction that was an authorized investment or transaction of the company that was merged or consolidated with the domestic property and casualty insurance company but that does not qualify as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this chapter at the time the merger or consolidation occurs, regardless of whether or not the investment or transaction would be authorized pursuant to subsection (A) or (B), then the investment or transaction is considered an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection and is not required to be applied toward the limitations contained in subsection (A) or (B), for a period of five years after the date on which the merger or consolidation occurs. After that period it shall no longer be an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection, unless within the five-year period: (1) the investment or transaction qualifies as an authorized investment or transaction pursuant to another subsection of this section or another section of this chapter including without limitation, subsections (A) and (B), if the domestic property and casualty insurance company so elects; or (2) the director authorizes the investment or transaction in the plan of merger or consolidation approved by the director; or (3) upon request of the insurer, the director authorizes an extension of the five-year time period; or (4) the director approves the investment or transaction pursuant to this subsection. The aggregate amount of a domestic insurance company's investments and transactions pursuant to this subsection, excluding investments and transactions authorized pursuant to items (1), (2), and (4), may not exceed twenty-five percent of the domestic insurance company's capital and surplus after giving effect to such merger or consolidation. (F) If a domestic insurance company, pursuant to a merger or consolidation, acquires a mortgage loan, or a participation in a mortgage loan, that would have been authorized pursuant to Section 38-12-480, and pursuant to subsection (C) of this section as to the portion that exceeded seventy-five percent of the value of the property, at the time the company that was merged or consolidated with the domestic insurance company invested in the mortgage loan or participation in the mortgage loan, then such mortgage loan or participation in the mortgage loan is authorized pursuant to Section 38-12-480, and pursuant to subsection (C) of this section as to the portion that exceeded seventy-five percent of the value of the property. (G) The director has full discretion in selecting a method for calculating values of investments and transactions that an insurer acquires through a merger or consolidation, provided that the method is consistent with any applicable provisions of this chapter and any applicable valuation method that the NAIC is currently using at the time with respect to investments and transactions. If there is a conflict between a provision of this chapter and the NAIC valuation method being used, the provision of this chapter controls. (H) The qualification or disqualification of an investment pursuant to one subsection of this section or one section of this chapter does not prevent its qualification in whole or in part pursuant to another provision of this chapter. An investment authorized by more than one provision of this chapter is authorized pursuant to the provision the insurer elects. An investment or transaction qualified pursuant to any provision of this chapter at the time it was acquired or entered into by the insurer shall continue to be qualified pursuant to that provision. An investment or transaction may be transferred in whole or in part at the election of the insurer to the authority of any provision of this chapter pursuant to which it then qualifies, whether or not it originally qualified pursuant to that provision. (I) Notwithstanding the provisions of the other subsections of this section or other sections of this chapter, an insurer may acquire an investment in or enter into a transaction with a business entity in which the insurer already holds one or more investments or with which the insurer has entered into one or more transactions if the investment is acquired or the transaction is entered into in order to protect an investment or transaction previously made in or with the business entity, provided that the aggregate amount of investments and transactions so acquired and entered into may not exceed five percent of the insurer's capital and surplus. (J)(1) The percentage authorizations and limitations contained in any provision of this chapter apply only at the time of the original acquisition of an investment or at the time a transaction is entered into and are not applicable to the insurer or the investment or transaction after that time except as provided in subsection (H). Once any investment or transaction is qualified pursuant to any provision of this chapter, it shall remain qualified notwithstanding any refinancing, restructuring, or modification of the investment or transaction, provided that the insurer does not engage in the refinancing, restructuring, or modification of the investment or transaction for the purposes of circumventing the requirements or limitations of this chapter. (2) The director has full discretion to value investments and transactions that an insurer holds at the time of an examination of the insurer using a method of calculating the values that the director selects in his discretion, provided that the method must be consistent with any applicable provisions of this chapter and any applicable valuation method that the NAIC is using at the time with respect to investments and transactions. If there is a conflict between such a provision of this chapter and an applicable NAIC valuation method that the NAIC is using at the time, the provision of this chapter controls. (3) Notwithstanding items (1) and (2), if the director determines that the continued operation of an insurer may be hazardous to its policyholders, its creditors, or the general public, the director may issue an order consistent with applicable statutes requiring the insurer to limit or withdraw from certain investments or transactions or discontinue certain practices as to investments or transactions to the extent the director considers necessary.
