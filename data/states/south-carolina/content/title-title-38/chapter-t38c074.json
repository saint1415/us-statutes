The Governor shall appoint three directors to the board. One must be appointed to represent consumers and two must be appointed to represent businesses, other than the insurance industry. In the event of a tie vote of the board on any matter, the issue must be presented to the director for his approval or disapproval. The selection of the administering insurer is subject to approval by the director. The board shall include, to the extent possible, at least two domestic insurance companies selling health insurance in South Carolina, including the domestic company selling the largest amount of health insurance. (C) If, within sixty days of the organizational meeting the board is not selected, the director shall appoint the initial board. (D) The board shall submit to the director or his designee a plan of operation for the pool and any amendments necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool. The director or his designee shall approve the plan of operation provided it is determined to be suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool and provides for the sharing of pool gains or losses on an equitable basis. The plan of operation is effective upon approval in writing by the director or his designee consistent with the date on which the coverage under this chapter must be made available. If the board fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within one hundred twenty days after the appointment of the board of directors, or at any time thereafter fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the department, after notice and hearing, shall promulgate reasonable regulations necessary to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. The regulations shall continue in force until modified by the department or superseded by a plan submitted by the board and approved by the director or his designee. (E) In its plan the board shall: (1) establish procedures for the handling and accounting of assets and monies of the pool; (2) select an administering insurer in accordance with Section 38-74-40 and establish procedures for filling vacancies on the board of directors; (3) establish procedures for the collection of assessments from all members to provide for claims incurred or estimated to be incurred under the plan and for administrative expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred during the period for which the assessment is made. The level of payments must be established by the board, pursuant to Section 38-74-50. Assessment occurs at the end of each fiscal year. The board may provide also for interim assessments against members of the pool if necessary to assure the financial capability of the pool. Assessments are due and payable within thirty days of receipt of the assessment notice; (4) develop and implement a program to publicize the existence of the plan, the eligibility requirements, and procedures for enrollment, and to maintain public awareness of the plan. (F) The pool has the general powers granted under the laws of this State to insurance companies licensed to transact accident and health insurance including, but not limited to, the specific authority to: (1) enter into contracts necessary to carry out the provisions of this act, including the authority, with the approval of the director or his designee, to enter into contracts with similar pools of other states for the joint performance of common administrative functions, or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions; (2) sue or be sued, including taking legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of assessments for, on behalf of, or against pool members; (3) take legal action as necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the pool or the coverage provided by or through the pool; (4) establish appropriate rates, rate schedules, rate adjustments, expense allowances, claim reserve formulas, and any other actuarial function appropriate to the operation of the pool; (5) assess members of the pool in accordance with the provisions of this act; (6) subject to the approval of the director or his designee, issue policies of insurance in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; (7) appoint from among members appropriate legal, actuarial, and other committees as necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the pool, policy, and other contract design, and any other function within the authority of the pool; (8) borrow money to effect the purposes of this act. Notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the pool not in default are legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets. The pool may not borrow money unless there is a net loss of the operation of the pool which exhausts the assessments of the pool for that year. No money may be borrowed in excess of the loss after assessments have been exhausted. No more than three million dollars may be borrowed in any one year, and the total amount borrowed at any one time may not exceed five million dollars. The members of the pool are responsible for any debt which is incurred by the pool; (9) cause to be audited on an independent basis every two years the finances of the pool and submit the report of audit to the department who shall submit it to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee with recommendations on the operations of the pool. (G) In addition to its general powers, the board may take measures to contain insurance costs subject to the approval of the director or his designee, including, but not limited to: (1) provide for and employ cost containment measures and requirements, including, but not limited to, preadmission screening, second surgical opinion, concurrent utilization review, and individual case management for the purpose of making the benefit plan more cost effective; (2) design, utilize, contract, or otherwise arrange for delivery of cost effective health care services, including establishing or contracting with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, or other limited network provider arrangements.

This determination must be made by the board; (c) a refusal to issue insurance coverage comparable to that provided by the pool except at a rate exceeding one hundred fifty percent of the pool rate; or (2) if the individual is a federally defined eligible individual or a Qualified TAA eligible individual, as defined in Section 38-74-10, who is and continues to be a resident of this State; or (3) if the individual is under the age of sixty-five and covered under Medicare Parts A and B for reasons other than age.

If proof is supplied and if coverage is applied for within sixty days after the involuntary termination and if premiums are paid for the entire coverage period, the effective date of the coverage is the date of termination of the previous coverage. Waiting period and preexisting condition exclusions are waived to the extent to which similar exclusions, if any, have been satisfied under the prior health insurance coverage. The waiver does not apply to a person whose policy has been terminated or rescinded involuntarily because of a material misrepresentation. (C) A person who is paying a premium for health insurance comparable to the pool plan in excess of one hundred fifty percent of the pool rate or who has received notice that the premium for a policy would be in excess of one hundred fifty percent of the pool rate may make application for coverage under the pool.

Benefits payable under the pool plan are secondary to benefits payable by the previous plan. The board shall require an additional premium for coverage effected under the plan in this manner notwithstanding the premium limitation stated in Section 38-74-60. (D)(1) The waiting period and preexisting condition exclusions are waived for a federally defined eligible individual. (2) The waiting period and preexisting condition exclusions are waived for a Qualified TAA eligible individual if the individual maintained creditable coverage for an aggregate period of three months as of the date on which the individual seeks to enroll in pool coverage, not counting any period prior to a sixty-three-day break in coverage. (E) A person not eligible for pool coverage is one who meets any one of the following criteria: (1) a person who has coverage under health insurance comparable to that offered by the pool from an insurer or any other source except a person who would be eligible under subsection (C); (2) a person who is eligible for health insurance comparable to that offered by the pool from an insurer or any other source except a person who would be eligible for pool coverage under subsection (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c), (A)(2), or (A)(3); (3) a person who at the time of pool application is eligible for health care benefits under state Medicaid or eligible for health care benefits under Medicare and age sixty-five or older; (4) a person having terminated coverage in the pool unless twelve months have lapsed since termination unless termination was because of ineligibility, except that this item shall not apply with respect to an applicant who is a federally defined eligible individual; (5) a person on whose behalf the pool has paid out one million dollars in benefits; (6) inmates of public institutions and persons eligible for public programs, except that this item shall not apply with respect to an applicant who is a federally defined eligible individual; (7) a person who fails to maintain South Carolina residency.

Health insurance premiums that are less than an amount determined by the board to justify the cost of collection are not considered for purposes of determining assessments.

The coverage to be issued by the pool, its schedule of benefits, exclusions, and other limitations must be established by the board and approved by the director taking into consideration the advice and recommendations of the pool members. (2) In establishing and reviewing the pool's major medical expense coverage, the board shall take into consideration the levels of health insurance provided in the State and medical and economic factors considered appropriate and promulgate benefit levels, deductibles, coinsurance factors, exclusions, and limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with health insurance provided through a representative number of large employers in the State. At least one policy form of coverage must be comparable to comprehensive health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in this State or to the standard health insurance plan as defined in Section 38-71-1330. (B) The pool shall offer Medicare supplemental health insurance coverage to each person who is under age sixty-five covered under Medicare Parts A and B for reasons other than age.

(2) The board shall determine the standard risk rate for major medical expense coverage by taking into account the individual standard rate charged by the five largest insurers offering individual coverages in the State comparable to the pool coverage. If five insurers do not offer comparable coverage, the standard risk rate must be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and must reflect anticipated experience and expenses for coverage. Rates initially established for pool coverage are two hundred percent of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks. Rates subsequently established must provide fully for the expected costs of claims and expenses of operation taking into account investment income and any other cost factors but may not exceed two hundred percent of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks subject to the limitations described in this section. All rates and rate schedules must be submitted to the director or his designee for approval. (3) Premium rates charged for Medicare supplemental insurance coverage may not be unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided, the risk experience, and the reasonable expenses of providing the coverage. Rates established must provide fully for the expected costs of claims and expenses of operation taking into account investment income and any other cost factors. (E) Except as provided in Section 38-74-30(B), (C), and (D), pool coverage excludes charges or expenses incurred during the first six months following the effective date of coverage as to any condition which during the six-month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage: (1) had manifested itself in a manner so as to cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or treatment; or (2) for which medical advice, care, or treatment was recommended or received as to the condition. (F)(1) A benefit otherwise payable under pool coverage for covered expenses must be reduced by all amounts paid or payable for the same expenses through any other health insurance or health coverage and by all hospital and medical expense benefits paid or payable under any workers' compensation coverage, automobile medical payment, or liability insurance whether provided on the basis of fault or nonfault, and by any hospital or medical benefits paid or payable under or provided pursuant to any state or federal law or program. (2) The insurer or the pool has a cause of action against an eligible person for the recovery of the amount of benefits paid which are not for covered expenses. Benefits due from the pool may be reduced or refused as a setoff against any amount recoverable under this paragraph.

      "text": "The pool established pursuant to this chapter is exempt from all taxes and assessments. Any member subject to tax liability imposed by any state statute may take credit for any assessment paid to the pool in the previous year against its premium or income tax payable. The tax credit is in addition to any other tax credits to which the member may be entitled pursuant to South Carolina law, but the credit may not reduce the member's tax liability below zero. Any unused credit may be carried forward three years. The credits are subject to the provisions of Section 38-7-120(c). The members are responsible for any loss of the operation of the pool, including any loss in excess of assessments paid to the pool. This State is not responsible for any loss of the operation of the pool, and no state funds may be used to defray any loss. If the total assessment for all members of the pool exceeds ten million dollars in any one year, the credit for any member shall be limited to the amount determined by multiplying the member's assessment by a fraction, the numerator of which equals ten million dollars and the denominator of which equals the total assessment in the year for all members of the pool. HISTORY: 1989 Act No. 127, Section 8; 2002 Act No. 240, Section 4, eff January 1, 2003.",
