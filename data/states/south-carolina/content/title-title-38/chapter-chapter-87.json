The risk retention group shall submit an appropriate revision in the event of any subsequent material change in any item of the plan of operation or feasibility study, within ten days of any such change.

Upon receipt of this information, the director or his designee may forward such information to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Providing notification to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is in addition to, and is not sufficient to satisfy, the requirements of Section 38-87-40 or any other provision of this chapter.\n\n(D)(1) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Board\" means the governing body of the risk retention group elected by the shareholders or members to establish policy, elect or appoint officers and committees, and make other governing decisions.\n\n(b) \"Director\" means a natural person designated in the articles of the risk retention group or designated, elected, or appointed by any other manner, name, or title to act as a director.\n\n(c) \"Disclose\" means to make information available through electronic or other means and to provide the information to members and insureds upon request.\n\n(d) \"Domestic regulator\" means the Director of the South Carolina Department of Insurance or the director's designee.\n\n(e) \"Material relationship\" means a relationship between a person with the risk retention group including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) the receipt in any one twelve-month period of compensation or payment of any other item of value by the person, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he is affiliated from the risk retention group or a consultant or service provider to the risk retention group that is greater than or equal to five percent of the risk retention group's gross written premium for this twelve-month period or two percent of its surplus, whichever is greater, as measured at the end of any fiscal quarter falling in this twelve-month period.
