      "text": "Unless the context requires otherwise, as used in this chapter: (1)(a) \"Long term care insurance\" means an insurance policy or a rider advertised, marketed, offered, or designed to provide coverage for not less than twelve consecutive months for each covered person on an expense incurred, indemnity, prepaid, or other basis, for one or more necessary or medically necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance, or personal care services, provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. The term includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders that provide directly or that supplement long term care insurance. It also includes a policy or rider that provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. The term also includes qualified long term care contracts. Long term care insurance may be issued by insurers, fraternal benefit societies, nonprofit health, hospital, and medical service corporations, prepaid health plans, health maintenance organizations, or a similar organization to the extent they otherwise are authorized to issue life or health insurance. Long term care insurance does not include an insurance policy offered primarily to provide basic Medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income or related asset protection coverage, accident only coverage, specified disease or specified accident coverage, or limited benefit health coverage. (b) With regard to life insurance, this term does not include life insurance policies that accelerate the death benefit specifically for one or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention, or permanent institutional confinement, and that provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and where neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long term care. Notwithstanding another provision of this chapter, a product advertised, marketed, or offered as long term care insurance is subject to the provisions of this chapter. (2) \"Applicant\" means: (a) in the case of an individual long term care insurance policy the person who seeks to contract for benefits; and (b) in the case of a group long term care insurance policy, the proposed certificate holder. (3) \"Certificate\" means any certificate issued under a group long term care insurance policy, which policy has been delivered or issued for delivery in this State. (4) \"Director\" means the person who is appointed by the Governor upon the advice and consent of the Senate and who is responsible for the operation and management of the Department of Insurance, including all of its divisions. The director may appoint or designate the person or persons who shall serve at the pleasure of the director to carry out the objectives or duties of the department as provided by law. Furthermore, the director may bestow upon his designee or deputy director any duty or function required of him by law in managing or supervising the insurance department. (5) \"Group long term care insurance\" means a long term care insurance policy which is delivered or issued for delivery in this State and issued to: (a) one or more employers or labor organizations, or to a trust or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations or a combination thereof, for employees or former employees or a combination thereof, or for members or former members or a combination thereof of the labor organizations; or (b) any professional, trade, or occupational association for its members or former or retired members or combination thereof if such association: (i) is composed of individuals all of whom are or were actively engaged in the same profession, trade, or occupation; and (ii) has been maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance; or (c) an association or to a trust or to the trustee of a fund established, created, or maintained for the benefit of members of one or more associations. Prior to advertising, marketing, or offering the policy within this State, the association or the insurer of the association shall file evidence with the department that the association has at the outset a minimum of one hundred persons and has been organized and maintained in good faith for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance, has been in active existence for at least one year, and has a constitution and bylaws which provide that the association holds regular meetings not less than annually to further the purposes of its members, except for credit unions, the association collects dues or solicits contributions from members, and the members have voting privileges and representation on the governing board and committees. Ninety days after the filing, the association is considered to have satisfied the organizational requirements unless the director or his designee makes a finding that the association does not satisfy those organizational requirements; or (d) a group other than as described in subitems (a), (b), and (c), subject to a finding by the director or his designee that the issuance of the group policy is not contrary to the best interest of the public, the issuance of the group policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration, and the benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged. (6) \"Policy\" means any policy, contract, subscriber agreement, rider, or endorsement delivered or issued for delivery in this State by an insurer, fraternal benefit society, nonprofit health, hospital, or medical service corporation, prepaid health plan, health maintenance organization, or any similar organization. (7)(a) \"Qualified long term care insurance contract\" or \"federally tax-qualified long term care insurance contract\" means an individual or a group insurance contract that meets the requirements of Section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as follows: (i) the only insurance protection provided under the contract is coverage of qualified long term care services. A contract does not fail to satisfy the requirements of this item by reason of payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expenses incurred during the period to which the payments relate; (ii) the contract does not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items to the extent that the expenses are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended, or would be so reimbursable but for the application of a deductible or coinsurance amount. The requirements of this subsubitem do not apply to expenses that are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act only as a secondary payor. A contract does not fail to satisfy the requirements of this subsubitem by reason of payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expenses incurred during the period to which payments relate; (iii) the contract is guaranteed renewable, within the meaning of Section 7702B(b)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; (iv) the contract does not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged as collateral for a loan, or borrowed except as provided in subsubitem (v); (v) all refunds of premiums, and all policyholder dividends or similar amounts, under the contract are to be applied as a reduction in future premiums or to increase future benefits, except that a refund if death occurs of the insured or a complete surrender or cancellation of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate premiums paid under the contract; and (vi) the contract meets the consumer protection provisions provided in Section 7702B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (b) \"Qualified long term care insurance contract\" or \"federally tax-qualified long term care insurance contract\" also means the portion of a life insurance contract that provides long term care insurance coverage by rider or as part of the contract and that satisfies the requirements of Section 7702B(b) and (e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      "text": "(A) The director or his designee shall submit to the General Assembly for approval regulations to carry out the purposes of this chapter. These regulations may include standards for full and fair disclosure setting forth the manner, content, and required disclosures for the sale of long term care insurance policies, terms of renewal, initial and subsequent conditions of eligibility, nonduplication of coverage provision, coverage of dependents, preexisting conditions, termination of insurance, continuation or conversion, probationary periods, limitations, exceptions, reductions, elimination periods, requirements for replacement, recurrent conditions, and definitions of terms. (B) A long term care insurance policy may not: (1) be canceled, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated except for nonpayment of the premium; (2) contain a provision establishing a new waiting period if existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new or other form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder; or (3) provide coverage for skilled nursing care only or provide significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility than coverage for lower levels of care. (C) The following applies to preexisting conditions: (1) A long term care insurance policy or certificate, other than a policy or certificate issued to a group as defined in Section 38-72-40(5)(a), may not use a definition of \"preexisting condition\" that is more restrictive than the following: \"Preexisting condition\" means a condition for which medical advice or treatment was recommended by or received from a provider of health care services within six months preceding the effective date of coverage of an insured person. (2) A long term care insurance policy or certificate, other than a policy or certificate issued to a group as defined in Section 38-72-40(5)(a), may not exclude coverage for a loss or confinement that is the result of a preexisting condition unless loss or confinement begins within six months following the effective date of coverage of an insured person. (3) The director or his designee may extend the limitation periods provided in items (1) and (2) as to specific age group categories in specific policy forms upon findings that the extension is in the best interest of the public. (4) The definition of \"preexisting condition\" does not prohibit an insurer from using an application form designed to elicit the complete health history of an applicant and, on the basis of the answers on that application, from underwriting in accordance with that insurer's established underwriting standards. Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in item (2) expires. A long term care insurance policy or certificate may not exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit, or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period in item (2). (D)(1) A long term care insurance policy may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this State if the policy conditions eligibility for benefits: (a) on a prior hospitalization requirement; (b) provided in an institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care; or (c) other than waiver of premium, post-confinement, post-acute care, or recuperative benefits on a prior institutionalization requirement. (2)(a) A long term care insurance policy containing post-confinement, post-acute care, or recuperative benefits clearly must label in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate entitled \"Limitations or Conditions on Eligibility for Benefits\" limitations or conditions, including the required number of days of confinement. (b) A long term care insurance policy or rider that conditions eligibility of post-confinement, post-acute care, or recuperative benefits on the prior receipt of institutional care may not require a prior institutional stay of more than thirty days. (c) A long term care insurance policy or rider that provides benefits only following institutionalization may not condition these benefits upon admission to a facility for the same or related conditions within a period of less than thirty days after discharge from the institution. (E) The director may adopt regulations establishing loss ratio standards for long term care insurance policies provided that a specific reference to long term care insurance policies is contained in the regulation. (F) The following applies to the right of the policyholder to return the policy: (1) Long term care insurance applicants have the right to return the policy or certificate within thirty days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. Long term care insurance policies and certificates must have a notice prominently printed on the first page or attached to it stating in substance that the applicant has the right to return the policy or certificate within thirty days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, other than a certificate issued pursuant to a policy issued to a group as defined in Section 38-72-40(5)(a), the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. (2) This subsection applies to denials of applications and any refund must be made within thirty days of the return or denial. (G)(1) An outline of coverage must be delivered to a prospective applicant for long term care insurance at the time of initial solicitation through means that prominently direct the attention of the recipient to the document and its purpose. (a) The director or his designee shall prescribe a standard format, including style, arrangement, and overall appearance, and the content of an outline of coverage. (b) For agent solicitations, an agent shall deliver the outline of coverage before the presentation of an application or enrollment form. (c) For direct response solicitations, the outline of coverage must be presented in conjunction with an application or enrollment form. (d) In the case of a policy issued to a group defined in Section 38-72-40(5)(a), an outline of coverage is not required to be delivered, provided that the information described in this subsection is contained in other materials relating to enrollment. Upon request, these other materials must be made available to the director. (2) The outline of coverage must include a: (a) description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy; (b) statement of the principal exclusions, reductions, and limitations contained in the policy; (c) statement of the terms under which the policy or certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including a reservation in the policy of a right to change the premium. Continuation or conversion provisions of group coverage must be described specifically; (d) statement that the outline of coverage is a summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master policy contains governing contractual provisions; (e) description of the terms under which the policy or certificate may be returned and premium refunded; (f) brief description of the relationship of cost of care and benefits; (g) statement that discloses to the policyholder or certificate holder whether the policy is intended to be a federally tax-qualified long term care insurance contract under 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (H) A certificate issued pursuant to a group long term care insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery in this State must include a: (1) description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy; (2) statement of the principal exclusions, reductions, and limitations contained in the policy; and (3) statement that the group master policy determines governing contractual provisions. (I) If an application for a long term care insurance contract or certificate is approved, the issuer shall deliver the contract or certificate of insurance to the applicant no later than thirty days after the date of approval. (J) At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary must be delivered for an individual life insurance policy that provides long term care benefits within the policy or by rider. For direct response solicitations, the insurer shall deliver the policy summary upon the applicant's request but, regardless of a request, shall make the delivery no later than at the time of policy delivery. In addition to complying with all applicable requirements, the summary also must include: (1) an explanation of how the long term care benefit interacts with other components of the policy, including deductions from death benefits; (2) an illustration of the amount of benefits, the length of benefits, and the guaranteed lifetime benefits, if any, for each covered person; (3) exclusions, reductions, and limitations on benefits of long term care; (4) if applicable to the policy type: (a) a disclosure of the effects of exercising other rights under the policy; (b) a disclosure of guarantees related to long term care costs of insurance charges; and (c) current and projected maximum lifetime benefits; and (5) the provisions of the policy summary listed in this subsection may be incorporated into a basic illustration required to be delivered in accordance with regulation 69-40, Life Insurance Policy Illustration Regulation or into the life insurance summary which is required to be delivered in accordance with regulation 69-30, Solicitation of Life Insurance Regulation. (K) When a long term care benefit, funded through a life insurance vehicle by the acceleration of the death benefit, is in benefit payment status, a monthly report must be provided to the policyholder. The report must include: (1) long term care benefits paid out during the month; (2) an explanation of changes in the policy, such as death benefits or cash values, due to long term care benefits being paid out; (3) the amount of long term care benefits existing or remaining. (L) If a claim under a long term care insurance contract is denied, the issuer, within sixty days of the date of a written request by the policyholder or certificate holder, or a representative of the issuer, shall: (1) provide a written explanation of the reasons for the denial; and (2) make available all information directly related to the denial. (M) A policy or rider advertised, marketed, or offered as long term care or nursing home insurance must comply with the provisions of this chapter. (N) All insurers issuing long term care insurance policies must offer, at time of application, an optional benefit which provides that when an insured meets the requirements under the policy that care in a nursing home or community residential care facility is necessary, the insured shall have the option of receiving necessary care in the home or community, with daily benefits at the same level that would have been paid for care in a nursing home or community residential care facility. This optional coverage may be provided by rider to the policy or included as part of the policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, insurers issuing long term care insurance policies may offer a home health care benefit which would provide benefits when care in the home only is necessary. This home health care benefit may provide lesser benefits than that provided by the policy for care in a nursing home or community residential care facility and may be provided either by rider to the policy or included as part of the policy.

(B) For a policy or certificate that has been in force for at least six months but less than two years, an insurer may rescind a long term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance for coverage and which pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought. (C) After a policy or certificate has been in force for two years, it is not contestable upon the grounds of misrepresentation alone; this policy or certificate may be contested only upon a showing that the insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to the insured's health. (D)(1) A long term care insurance policy or certificate may be field issued if the compensation to the field issuer is not based on the number of policies or certificates issued. (2) For purposes of this section, \"field issued\" means a policy or certificate issued by a producer or a third party administrator pursuant to the underwriting authority granted to the producer or third party administrator by an insurer and using the insurer's underwriting guidelines. (E) If an insurer has paid benefits under the long term care insurance policy or certificate, the benefit payments may not be recovered by the insurer if the policy or certificate is rescinded. (F) If the insured dies, this section does not apply to the remaining death benefit of a life insurance policy that accelerates benefits for long term care. In this situation, the remaining death benefits under these policies are as provided by Section 38-63-220(d). In all other situations, this section applies to life insurance policies that accelerate benefits for long term care. HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 274, Section 1, eff June 4, 2008.",

The applicant has the right to designate at least one person who is to receive the notice of termination, in addition to the insured. Designation must not constitute acceptance of any liability on the third party for services provided to the insured. The form used for the written designation must provide space clearly designated for listing at least one person. The designation must include each person's full name and home address. In the case of an applicant who elects not to designate an additional person, the waiver must state: \"Protection against unintended lapse. I understand that I have the right to designate at least one person other than myself to receive notice of lapse or termination of this long-term care insurance policy for nonpayment of premium. I understand that notice will not be given until thirty (30) days after a premium is due and unpaid. I elect NOT to designate a person to receive this notice.\" The insurer shall notify the insured of the right to change this written designation no less often than once every two years. (ii) For existing long-term care policies, the insurer must provide written notice to the insured that they may make a written designation of a least one person, in addition to the insured, who is to receive notice of lapse or termination of the policy or certificate. The notice called for in this subsection must be provided to the insured within ninety days of the effective date of this section. As provided in this subitem, the insurer shall notify the insured of the right to change this written designation no less often than once every two years. (b) When the policyholder or certificate holder pays a premium for a long-term care insurance policy or certificate through a payroll or pension deduction plan, the requirements contained in subsubitem (i) of subitem (a) need not be met until sixty days after the policyholder or certificate holder is no longer on such a payment plan. The application or enrollment form for such policies or certificates must clearly indicate the payment plan selected by the applicant. (c) Lapse or termination for nonpayment of a premium. No individual long-term care policy or certificate shall lapse or be terminated for nonpayment of a premium unless the insurer, at least thirty days before the effective date of the lapse or termination, has given notice to the insured and to those persons designated pursuant to subsubitem (i) of subitem (a), at the address provided by the insured for purposes of receiving notice of lapse or termination. Notice must be given by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, and notice may not be given until thirty days after a premium is due and unpaid. Notice must be considered to have been given as of five days after the date of mailing. (2) In addition to the requirement in item (1), a long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall include a provision that provides for reinstatement of coverage in the event of lapse or termination if the insurer is provided proof that the policyholder or certificate holder was cognitively impaired or had a loss of functional capacity before the grace period contained in the policy expired. This option must be available to the insured if requested within five months after termination and must allow for the collection of the past due premium, where appropriate. The standard of proof of cognitive impairment or loss of functional capacity must not be more stringent than the benefit eligibility criteria on cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity contained in the policy and certificate.

      "text": "(A) All premium rate schedules for long-term care insurance must be filed with the department and are subject to the prior approval of the director or his designee. (1) An insurer may not charge a premium to an insured under a policy or contract of long-term care insurance before the applicable premium rate is filed with and approved by the director or his designee. (2) An insurer may not change the premium charged to an insured under a policy or contract of long-term care insurance until the applicable premium rate change has been filed with and approved by the director or his designee. (3) The director or his designee may disapprove or modify premium rates if he determines that the benefits provided are unreasonable in relation to the premiums charged, appear to be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits or appear to have assumptions that are unreasonable in the aggregate or for each assumption individually. The director or his designee shall notify the insurer of his decision in writing as soon as is practicable. In the event of disapproval, the notice must contain the reasons for disapproval, and the insurer is entitled to appeal the decision or determination of disapproval before the Administrative Law Court as provided by law. If no action has been taken to approve or disapprove the premium rates after they have been filed for ninety days, they are deemed to be approved. This period may be extended by the director or his designee for an additional period or periods not to exceed ninety days per period if he gives written notice within the waiting period to the insurer which made the filing that he needs additional time for the consideration of the filing. Upon written application by the insurer, the director or his designee may authorize a filing which he has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof. (4) The director may disapprove a previously approved filing at any time following notice to the insurer. (B)(1) Any applicable premium rate or premium rate change of an insurer must be filed with the director or his designee in accordance with guidance issued by the director or his designee by bulletin, regulation, or other method. (2) In addition to the factors set forth in this chapter and in regulation, the director or his designee shall consider the following to the extent appropriate when determining whether to disapprove or modify a premium rate filing of an insurer: (a) past and prospective loss experience in and outside the State; (b) underwriting practice and judgment; (c) a reasonable margin for reserve needs; (d) past and prospective expenses, both countrywide and those specifically applicable to the State; (e) prior approved rate changes; and (f) any other relevant factors necessary including the factors set forth in the regulation. (C) The director or his designee may hold a public hearing or solicit public comments as a part of the process to review long-term care insurance rate filings received by the director or his designee. The director or his designee shall provide all individuals present at a public hearing held pursuant to this section an opportunity to offer testimony or written comments. The director or his designee may place time limits on the testimony. (D)(1) Each premium rate filing and any supporting information filed under this chapter and subject to disclosure must be open to public inspection after the filing becomes effective. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (1), if the director or his designee holds a public hearing or solicits public comments on a premium rate filing pursuant to subsection (D), he may open to public inspection some or all portions of the filing that are subject to disclosure as a part of the public hearing or solicitation of public comments. (E) Each decision of the director or his designee about premium rates made under this section is subject to judicial review in accordance with Section 38-3-210.
