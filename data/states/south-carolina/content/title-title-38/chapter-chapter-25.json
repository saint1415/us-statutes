In furtherance of this state interest, the General Assembly herein provides methods for substituted service of process upon such insurers in any proceeding, suit, or action in any court, including the Administrative Law Court as provided by law, and substituted service of any notice, order, pleading, or process upon such insurers in any proceeding by the director or his designee to enforce or effect full compliance with the insurance laws of this State.

That order must be served upon the person either by certified mail, return receipt requested, at that person's last known address, or in any other manner permitted by law.\n\n(B) An emergency cease and desist order issued by the director must, within its provisions, give notice that the person may contest that order by petitioning for an immediate public hearing before an administrative law judge. The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the director's decision. The administrative law judge may order a stay upon appropriate terms, and if a stay is granted, the administrative law judge must specifically consider in his order the appropriateness of the posting of a bond by the petitioner. At the public hearing the person must be given the opportunity to be heard upon the findings and conclusions within the emergency cease and desist order. If no request for a public hearing is received within ten days from the person's receipt of service of the emergency cease and desist order, then upon application by the director and without a public hearing, the administrative law judge must make that emergency order a permanent cease and desist order.\n\n(C) If an administrative law judge determines that the person charged with transacting insurance business in violation of this chapter knew or should have known that his actions were in violation of this chapter, then in addition to declaring the cease and desist order to be permanent the administrative law judge may impose a penalty of up to fifty thousand dollars for each violation. The penalty may be imposed following a public hearing requested by the person pursuant to subsection (B) or following a public hearing requested by the director following an administrative law judge's default permanent cease and desist order.\n\n(D) In addition to any other penalties or remedies available, including Sections 38-25-320, 38-25-330, and 38-25-360, if the director believes that a person has violated a permanent cease and desist order issued by an administrative law judge, then the director may certify the relevant facts to the circuit court in any county of this State where that person has transacted business in violation of the permanent cease and desist order. The circuit court, upon its finding that the permanent cease and desist order has been violated, may order the violator to pay an additional penalty of up to twenty-five thousand dollars for each violation.\n\n(E) Any penalties ordered pursuant either to subsection (C) or (D) may be entered immediately by the director upon the judgment rolls in any county where that person resides or where that person has transacted business.

Before an eligible surplus lines insurer files or causes to be filed any action, suit, or proceeding in this State to enforce a right, claim, or demand arising out of the transaction of insurance, it shall produce evidence that the security deposit is presently on file or that the required surety bond is then in force and effect.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-52-60 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-267; 1962 Code Section 37-267; 1978 Act No. 457 Section 1] Section 38-53-30 [1975 (59) 127; 1976 Act No. 732 Section 8] recodified as Section 38-25-540 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 314, Section 3; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 605.",

      "text": "(a) Before an unauthorized insurer files or causes to be filed any pleading in any court action, suit, or proceeding or any notice, order, pleading, or process in an administrative proceeding before the director or his designee instituted against the person or insurer, the insurer shall either:\n\n(1) Deposit with the clerk of court in which the action, suit, or proceeding is pending, or with the director or his designee in administrative proceedings before the director or his designee, cash or securities, or file with the clerk of court or the director or his designee a bond with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the clerk or director or his designee, in an amount to be fixed by the court or director or his designee sufficient to secure the payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in the action or administrative proceeding.\n\n(2) Procure a certificate of authority to transact the business of insurance in this State. In considering the application of an insurer for a certificate of authority, for the purposes of this paragraph, the director or his designee need not assert the provisions of Section 38-7-90 against the insurer with respect to its application if he determines that the insurer would otherwise comply with the requirements for a certificate of authority.\n\n(b) The director or his designee, in an administrative proceeding in which service is made as provided in Section 38-25-510, may in his discretion order a postponement as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to comply with subsection (a) and to defend the action.\n\n(c) This section does not apply to an eligible surplus lines insurer which maintains the deposit required by Section 38-9-80 or which has on file with the department a surety bond issued by an admitted insurer in an amount determined by the director or his designee to be sufficient to meet the security requirements of Section 38-9-80.

      "text": "(a) The Attorney General upon request of the director or his designee may proceed in the courts of this State or any reciprocal state to enforce an order or decision in any court proceeding or in any administrative proceeding before the director or his designee.\n\n(b) As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"Reciprocal state\" means any state or territory of the United States the laws of which contain procedures substantially similar to those specified in this section for the enforcement of decrees or orders in equity issued by courts located in other states or territories of the United States against an insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in that state or territory.\n\n(2) \"Foreign decree\" means any decree or order in equity of a court located in a reciprocal state, including a court of the United States located therein, against any insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in this State.\n\n(3) \"Qualified party\" means a state regulatory agency acting in its capacity to enforce the insurance laws of its state.\n\n(c) The director or his designee shall determine which states and territories qualify as reciprocal states and shall maintain an up-to-date list of these states.\n\n(d) A copy of any foreign decree authenticated in accordance with the law of this State may be filed in the office of the clerk of court of any circuit court of this State. The clerk, upon verifying with the department that the decree or order qualifies as a foreign decree, shall treat the foreign decree in the same manner as a decree of a circuit court of this State. A foreign decree so filed has the same effect as a decree of a circuit court of this State and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a decree of a circuit court of this State and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.\n\n(e)(1) At the time of the filing of the foreign decree, the Attorney General shall make and file with the clerk of court an affidavit setting forth the name and last known post office address of the defendant.\n\n(2) Promptly upon the filing of the foreign decree and the affidavit, the clerk shall mail notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant at the address given and to the department and shall make a note of the mailing in the docket. In addition, the Attorney General may mail a notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant and to the department and may file proof of mailing with the clerk. Failure to mail notice of the filing by the clerk does not affect the enforcement proceedings if proof of mailing by the Attorney General has been filed.\n\n(3) No execution or other process for enforcement of a foreign decree filed hereunder may issue for thirty days after the date the decree is filed.\n\n(f)(1) If the defendant shows the circuit court that an appeal from the foreign decree is pending or will be taken, or that a stay of execution has been granted, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal expires, or the stay of execution expires or is vacated, upon proof that the defendant has furnished the security for the satisfaction of the decree required by the state in which it was rendered.\n\n(2) If the defendant shows the circuit court any ground upon which enforcement of a decree of any circuit court of this State would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction of the decree which is required in this State.\n\n(g) Any person filing a foreign decree shall pay to the clerk of court fifteen dollars. Fees for docketing, transcription, or other enforcement proceedings are as provided for decrees of the circuit court.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-53-70 [1975 (59) 127] recodified as Section 38-25-570 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 607.",
