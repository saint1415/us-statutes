      "text": "The pool established pursuant to this chapter is exempt from all taxes and assessments. Any member subject to tax liability imposed by any state statute may take credit for any assessment paid to the pool in the previous year against its premium or income tax payable. The tax credit is in addition to any other tax credits to which the member may be entitled pursuant to South Carolina law, but the credit may not reduce the member's tax liability below zero. Any unused credit may be carried forward three years. The credits are subject to the provisions of Section 38-7-120(c). The members are responsible for any loss of the operation of the pool, including any loss in excess of assessments paid to the pool. This State is not responsible for any loss of the operation of the pool, and no state funds may be used to defray any loss. If the total assessment for all members of the pool exceeds ten million dollars in any one year, the credit for any member shall be limited to the amount determined by multiplying the member's assessment by a fraction, the numerator of which equals ten million dollars and the denominator of which equals the total assessment in the year for all members of the pool.\n\nHISTORY: 1989 Act No. 127, Section 8; 2002 Act No. 240, Section 4, eff January 1, 2003.",
