(2) The director or his designee may require that these reserves are equal to the unearned portions of the gross premiums in force as computed on each respective risk from the policy's date of issue. If the director or his designee does not so require, the portions of the gross premium in force to be held as premium reserve must be computed according to the following table: Term for Which Policy was Written Reserved for Unearned Premium 1 year or less 1/2 2 years 1st year 3/4 2nd year 1/4 3 years 1st year 5/6 2nd year 1/2 3rd year 1/6 4 years 1st year 7/8 2nd year 5/8 3rd year 3/8 4th year 1/8 5 years 1st year 9/10 2nd year 7/10 3rd year 1/2 4th year 3/10 5th year 1/10 Over 5 years pro rata.

(4) After adopting a method for computing the reserve, an insurer may not change methods without the director's or his designee's approval. (5) With reference to marine insurance, premiums on trip risks not terminated are considered unearned, and the director or his designee may require the insurer to carry a reserve equal to one hundred percent on trip risks written during the month ended as of the date of statement. For all accident and health policies the insurer shall maintain an active life reserve which places a sound value on its liabilities under these policies and which is not less than the reserve according to standards set forth in regulations issued by the director and not less, in the aggregate, than the pro rata gross unearned premium reserves for these policies.

If an insurer makes no election, the effective date of this item for the insurer is January 1, 1979. (F)(1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this subsection must be used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of: (a) life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of Section 38-63-600 of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance; (b) individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year after December 31, 1982; (c) annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year after December 31, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; (d) the net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts. (2) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, must be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: (a) for life insurance, I = .03 + W (R(1) - .03) + W* (1/2 ) * (R(2) - .09); (b) for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, I = .03 + W (R - .03), where R(1) is the lesser of R and .09, R(2) is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection, and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection; (c) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subitem (b), the formula for life insurance stated in subitem (a) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subitem (b) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less; (d) for other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subitem (b) applies; (e) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subitem (b) applies. However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policies must be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year must be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined for 1979, and must be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when Section 38-63-600 of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance becomes operative. (3) The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated in this subsection are given in the following tables: (a) weighting Factors for Life Insurance: Guarantee Duration Weighting Years 10 or Less: .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .45 More than 20 .35 For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance may remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy; (b) weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: Weighting Factors .80 (c) weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in subitem (b) of this item are as specified subsubitems (i), (ii), and (iii) according to the rules and definitions in subsubitems (iv), (v), and (vi): (i) for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis: Guarantee Duration Weighting (Years) for Plan Type A B C 5 or less .80 .60 .50 More than five, but not more than 10: .75 .60 .50 More than 10, but not more than 20: .65 .50 .45 More than 20: .45 .35 .35 (ii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in subsubitem (i) of this subitem increased by: Plan Type A B C .15 .25 .05 (iii) for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis other than those with no cash settlement options, which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than twelve months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in subsubitem (i) of this subitem or derived in subsubitem (ii) increased by: Plan Type A B C .05 .05 .05 (iv) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence. (d) Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as: (i) Plan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only: a. with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; b. without the adjustment but in installments over five years or more; c. as an immediate life annuity; or d. no withdrawal permitted; (ii) Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only: a. with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; b. without the adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or c. no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without the adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years; (iii) Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: a. without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or b. subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund. An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund. (4) The Reference Interest Rate referred to in item (2) of this subsection is defined as: (a) for life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (b) for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (c) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subitem (b) with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over thirty-six months and the average over twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (d) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subitem (b), with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (e) for other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (f) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subitem (b), the average over twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (5) If Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulation promulgated by the director, may be substituted. (G) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (H) and (K), reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, are the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of future modified net premiums. The modified net premiums for the policy are the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the modified net premiums is equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of item (1) over item (2), as follows: (1) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due. However, the net level annual premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age of issue of the policy. (2) A net one year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year. For a life insurance policy issued after December 31, 1985, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of them in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the director's or his designee's reserve valuation method as of a policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this section as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of an endowment benefit and cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium, except as otherwise provided in subsection (K), is the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with the value defined in item (1) being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of the excess first year premium, all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, the policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment, and the cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in subsection (E)(1) and (F) shall be used. Reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method for: life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums, group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer including a partnership or sole proprietorship or by an employee organization, or both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts, and all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, must be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of subsection (F), except extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards must be disregarded in the determination of modified net premiums. (H) This subsection applies to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Reserves according to the commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in the contracts, is the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of the contract, that become payable before the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits must be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values. (I)(1) An insurer's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued after March 23, 1960, must not be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (G), (H), (K), and (L) and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. (2) The aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits must not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (D). (J) Reserves for policies and contracts issued before March 24, 1960, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to the standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately before the date. Reserves for a category of policies, contracts, or benefits established by the director or his designee, after March 23, 1960, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to the standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, must not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits. An insurer which adopts a standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section, with the approval of the director or his designee, may adopt a lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided in this section. However, for purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (D) must not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation. (K) If in a contract year the gross premium charged by a company on a policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract is the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections (E)(1) and (F). For a life insurance policy issued after December 31, 1985, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of them in an amount greater than the excess premium, this subsection must be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy were the method described in subsection (G), ignoring the second paragraph of subsection (G). The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of the policy is the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (G), including the second paragraph of that subsection, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection. (L) For a plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or for a plan of life insurance or annuity which is of a nature so that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (G), (H), and (K), the reserves which are held under the plan must be: (1) appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; (2) computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this Standard Valuation Law, as determined by regulations promulgated by the director. (M) For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under subsection (C)(2). (N)(1) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under subsection (C)(2), except as provided under items (5) or (7). (2) The operative date of the valuation manual is January first of the first calendar year following July first as of which all of the following have occurred: (a) The valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote of at least forty-two members, or three-fourths of the members voting, whichever is greater. (b) The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by states representing greater than seventy-five percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements submitted for 2008: life, accident and health annual statements; health annual statements; or fraternal annual statements. (c) The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by at least forty-two of the following fifty-five jurisdictions: the fifty states of the United States, American Samoa, the American Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. (3) Unless a change in the valuation manual specifies a later effective date, changes to the valuation manual shall be effective on January first following the date when the change to the valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote representing: (a) at least three-fourths of the members of the NAIC voting, but not less than a majority of the total membership; and (b) members of the NAIC representing jurisdictions totaling greater than seventy-five percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements most recently available prior to the vote in subitem (a): life, accident and health annual statements, health annual statements, or fraternal annual statements. (4) The valuation manual must specify all of the following: (a) minimum valuation standards for and definitions of the policies or contracts subject to subsection (C)(2). These minimum valuation standards must be: (i) the commissioner's reserve valuation method for life insurance contracts, other than annuity contracts, subject to subsection (C)(2); (ii) the commissioner's annuity reserve valuation method for annuity contracts subject to subsection (C)(2); and (iii) minimum reserves for all other policies or contracts subject to subsection (C)(2); (b) the policies or contracts or types of policies or contracts that are subject to the requirements of a principle-based valuation in subsection (O)(1) and the minimum valuation standards consistent with those requirements; (c) for policies and contracts subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (O): (i) requirements for the format of reports to the director under subsection (O)(2)(c) and which must include information necessary to determine if the valuation is appropriate and in compliance with this section; (ii) assumptions must be prescribed for risks over which the company does not have significant control or influence; (iii) procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial function, and a process for appropriate waiver or modification of the procedures; (d) for policies not subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (O), the minimum valuation standard must either: (i) be consistent with the minimum standard of valuation prior to the operative date of the valuation manual; or (ii) develop reserves that quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring; (e) other requirements, including, but not limited to, those relating to reserve methods, models for measuring risk, generation of economic scenarios, assumptions, margins, use of company experience, risk measurement, disclosure, certifications, reports, actuarial opinions and memorandums, transition rules and internal controls; and (f) the data and form of the data required under subsection (O), with whom the data must be submitted, and may specify other requirements including data analyses and reporting of analyses. (5) In the absence of a specific valuation requirement or if a specific valuation requirement in the valuation manual is not, in the opinion of the director or his designee, in compliance with this section, then the company shall, with respect to such requirements, comply with minimum valuation standards prescribed by the director by regulation. (6) The director or his designee may engage a qualified actuary, at the expense of the company, to perform an actuarial examination of the company and opine on the appropriateness of any reserve assumption or method used by the company, or to review and opine on a company's compliance with any requirement set forth in this section. The director or his designee may rely upon the opinion, regarding provisions contained within this section, of a qualified actuary engaged by the commissioner of another state, district, or territory of the United States. As used in this item, the term \"engage\" includes employment and contracting. (7) The director or his designee may require a company to change any assumption or method that, in the opinion of the director or his designee, is necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the valuation manual or this section; and the company shall adjust the reserves as required by the director or his designee. The director or his designee may take other disciplinary action as permitted pursuant to Sections 38-2-10 and 38-5-120. (O)(1) A company must establish reserves using a principle-based valuation that meets the following conditions for policies or contracts as specified in the valuation manual: (a) Quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of the contracts. For polices or contracts with significant tail risk, reflects conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk. (b) Incorporate assumptions, risk analysis methods and financial models, and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, those utilized within the company's overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods. (c) Incorporate assumptions that are prescribed in the valuation manual or for assumptions that are not prescribed, the assumptions must be established using the company's available experience, to the extent it is relevant and statistically credible; or to the extent that company data is not available, relevant, or statistically credible, be established utilizing other relevant, statistically credible experience. (d) Provide margins for uncertainty including adverse deviation and estimation error, such that the greater the uncertainty, the larger the margin and resulting reserve. (2) A company using a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to this section as specified in the valuation manual shall: (a) establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with those described in the valuation manual; (b) provide to the director and the company's board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation. These controls must be designed to assure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets subject to such valuation are included in the valuation, and that valuations are made in accordance with the valuation manual. The certification must be based on the controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year; and (c) develop, and file with the director or his designee upon request, a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the valuation manual. (3) A principle-based valuation may include a prescribed formulaic reserve component. (P) A company shall submit mortality, morbidity, policyholder behavior, or expense experience and other data as prescribed in the valuation manual. (Q)(1) For purposes of this subsection, \"confidential information\" means: (a) a memorandum in support of an opinion submitted pursuant to subsection (D) and any other documents, materials, and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies created, produced or obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in connection with the memorandum; (b) all documents, materials, and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies, created, produced or obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in the course of an examination made pursuant to subsection (N)(6); provided, however, that if an examination report or other material prepared in connection with an examination made under Section 38-13-20 is not held as private and confidential information under Section 38-13-10, et seq., an examination report or other material prepared in connection with an examination made under subsection (N)(6) is not \"confidential information\" to the same extent as if such examination report or other material had been prepared under Section 38-13-10, et seq.; (c) any reports, documents, materials, and other information developed by a company in support of, or in connection with, an annual certification by the company pursuant to subsection (O)(2)(b) evaluating the effectiveness of the company's internal controls with respect to a principle-based valuation and any other documents, materials, and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies, created, produced or obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in connection with such reports, documents, materials, and other information; (d) any principle-based valuation report developed under subsection (O)(2)(c) of this section and any other documents, materials, and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies of them, created, produced or obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in connection with the report; and (e) any documents, materials, data and other information submitted by a company pursuant to subsection (P), collectively, \"experience data\", and any other documents, materials, data and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies created or produced in connection with the experience data, in each case that includes any potentially company-identifying or personally identifiable information, that is provided to or obtained by the director or his designee, together with any \"experience data\", \"experience materials\", and any other documents, materials, data and other information, including, but not limited to, all working papers, and copies, created, produced, or obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in connection with such experience materials. (2)(a) Except as provided in this subsection, a company's confidential information is confidential by law and privileged, is not subject to disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, and is not subject to subpoena or discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action; provided, however, that the director or his designee is authorized to use the confidential information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought against the company as a part of the director's or his designee's official duties. (b) Neither the director nor any person who received confidential information while acting under the authority of the director is permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential information. (c) In order to assist in the performance of the director's or his designee's duties, the director or his designee may share confidential information with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies and with the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and in the case of confidential information specified in item (1)(a) and (d) only, with the Actuarial Board for Counseling and Discipline, or its successor, upon request stating that the confidential information is required for the purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings and with state, federal, and international law enforcement officials, provided that such recipient agrees, and has the legal authority to agree, to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of such documents, materials, data and other information in the same manner and to the same extent as required for the director or his designee.

      "text": "(A) Credit for reinsurance must be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of subsection (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) provided that the director or his designee may, pursuant to subsection (N), adopt by regulation additional specific requirements in relation to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements, or the circumstances pursuant to which a credit may be reduced or eliminated. Credit only may be allowed under subsection (B), (C), or (D) of this section as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. If meeting the requirements of subsection (D) or (E), the requirements of subsection (I) also must be met. (B) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this State or approved as a reinsurer by the director or his designee provided by Section 38-5-60. It is not the intent of this provision to allow an insurer domiciled outside this State to take credit for reinsurance in its financial statements based on the domestic license, authorization, or accreditation. (C) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is accredited as a reinsurer in this State. An accredited reinsurer is one which: (1) files with the director or his designee evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction; (2) submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records; (3) is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, for a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance, in at least one state; (4) files annually with the director or designee a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and (5) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement at the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as it regards policyholders of no less than twenty million dollars and its accreditation has not been denied by the director or his designee within ninety days after the submission of its application. (D)(1) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this statute and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer: (a) maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars; and (b) submits to the authority of this State to examine its books and records. (2) The requirement of item (1)(a) under this subsection, does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system. (E)(1) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, defined in Section 38-9-220(B), for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. To enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the director or his designee information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners annual statement form by licensed insurers. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the director and bear the expense of examination. (2)(a) Credit for reinsurance must not be granted under this subsection unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by: (i) the insurance commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled; or (ii) the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. (b) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also must be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims must be valid and enforceable upon the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to assets in the trustees of the trust for the benefit of the assuming insurers' United States ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director or his designee. (c) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No later than February twenty-eighth of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the director or his designee in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust may not expire before the next following December thirty-first. (3) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers: (a) The trust fund for a single assuming insurer consists of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers, and in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars. However, after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after finding that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of domestic ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development based on an assessment of the risk. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows and shall consider all material risk factors including, but not limited to, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance by domestic ceding insurers covered by the trust. (b)(i) In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters: (A) for reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment, or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust consists of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group; (B) for reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 31, 1992, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the trust consists of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter's several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States; and (C) in addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars is held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account; and (ii) The incorporated members of the group must not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members. (iii) The group, within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each underwriter member of the group. (c) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall: (i) have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately before making application for accreditation; (ii) maintain aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least ten billion dollars; (iii) maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group; (iv) in addition, maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars must be held jointly for the benefit of United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities; and (v) within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, make available to the director an annual certification of each underwriter member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant. (F)(1) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the director or his designee as a reinsurer in this State and secures its obligations with the requirements of this subsection. (2) In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer must: (a) be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to this section; (b) maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the director or his designee pursuant to regulation; (c) maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the director or his designee pursuant to regulation; (d) agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this State, appoint the director as its agent for service of process in this State, and agree to provide security for one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by domestic ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment; (e) agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the director or his designee, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and (f) satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the commissioner. (3) An association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, may be a certified reinsurer. In addition to satisfying other requirements of item (2) of this subsection, in order to be eligible for certification: (a) the association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities of the association and its members, which includes a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the director to provide adequate protection; (b) the incorporated members of the association may not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and (c) within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the director an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association. (4) The director or his designee shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the director and a certified reinsurer. (a) In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the director shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the director with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the director has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgment and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the director. (b) A list of qualified jurisdictions must be published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Committee Process. The director or his designee shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the director or his designee approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the director or his designee shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations. (c) United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program must be recognized as qualified jurisdictions. (d) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the director or his designee has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation. (5) The director or his designee shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the director or his designee pursuant to regulation. The director or his designee shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings. (6) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from domestic ceding insurers under this subsection at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the director or his designee. (a) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the director or his designee and consistent with the provisions of this section, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subsection (E), except as otherwise provided in this subsection. (b) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to subsection (E), and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligation incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subsection or comparable laws of other domestic jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to subsection (E). It is a condition to the grant of certification under subsection (F) that the certified reinsurer shall bind itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other trust account. (c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subsection (E) are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that the trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars. (d) If the security is insufficient, the director or his designee shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due. (e) A certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations. (i) As used in this subsection, the term \"terminate\" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status. (ii) If the director or his designee continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended. (7) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a NAIC-accredited jurisdiction, the director or his designee has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification and to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer must be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this State. (8) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this State may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the director or his designee shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. (G)(1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below: (a) The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction. A \"reciprocal jurisdiction\" is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following: (i) a non-U.S. jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this subsection, a \"covered agreement\" is an agreement entered into pursuant to Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. Sections 313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this State or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance; (ii) a U.S. jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program; or (iii) a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to Section 38-9-200(F)(4), which is not otherwise described in subsubitem (a)(i) or (a)(ii) and which meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the director in regulation. (b) The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities), calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth in regulation. (c) The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, which will be set forth in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ration in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and also is licensed. (d) The assuming insurer must agree and provide adequate assurance to the director, in a form specified by the director pursuant to regulation, as follows: (i) the assuming insurer must provide prompt written notice and explanation to the director if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subitems (b) or (c), or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law; (ii) the assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State and to the appointment of the director as agent for service of process. The director may require that consent for service of process be provided to the director and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this provision shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws; (iii) the assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained; (iv) each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and (v) the assuming insurer must confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement which involves this state's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the director and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of Section 38-9-200(F) and Section 38-9-210 and as specified by the director in regulation. (e) The assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide, if required by the director, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the director, as specified by the director in regulation. (f) The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth in regulation. (g) The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must confirm to the director on an annual basis, as of the preceding December thirty-first or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in subitems (b) and (c). (h) Nothing in this provision precludes an assuming insurer from providing the director with information on a voluntary basis. (2) The director timely shall create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions. (a) A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the NAIC Committee Process. The director's list shall include any reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under Section 38-9-200(G)(1)(a)(i) and (ii), and shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the NAIC list. The director may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations issued by the director. (b) The director may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process set forth in regulations issued by the director, except that the director shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under Section 38-9-200(G)(1)(a)(i) and (ii). Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer which has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to Section 38-9-200, et seq. (3) The director shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this subsection and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this subsection. The director may add an assuming insurer to such list if an NAIC-accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the director as required under item (1)(d) of this subsection and complies with any additional requirements that the director may impose by regulation, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement. (4) If the director determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subsection, the director may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures set forth in regulation. (a) While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Section 38-9-210. (b) If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of the revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and consistent with the provisions of Section 38-9-210. (5) If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities. (6) Nothing in this subsection shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by Sections 38-9-200, et seq. or other applicable law or regulation. (7) Credit may be taken under this subsection only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed on or after the effective date of the statute adding this subsection, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of: (i) the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to Section 38-9-200(G)(1) herein, and (ii) the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal. (a) This item does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this subsection, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of Section 38-9-200, et seq. (b) Nothing in this subsection shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement. (c) Nothing in this subsection shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement. (H) Credit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction. (I) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, certified, or accredited to transact insurance or reinsurance in this State, the credit permitted by subsections (D) and (E) may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements: (1) that when the assuming insurer fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in a state of the United States, comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and abide by the final decision of the court or of an appellate court in an appeal; and (2) to designate the director or his designee or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served lawful process in an action, a suit, or a proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company. (3) This subsection does not conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes if an obligation is created in the agreement. (J) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (B), (C), (D), or (G) the credit permitted by subsection (E) or (F) may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions: (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the amount required by subsection (E)(3), or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation, or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund. (2) The assets must be distributed by and claims must be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies. (3) If the commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of them are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part of them must be returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement. (4) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this provision. (K) If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the director may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification. (1) The director must give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing. The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the director's order on hearing, unless: (a) the reinsurer waives its right to hearing; (b) the director's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer; or (c) the director finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the director's action. (2) While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Section 38-9-210.

If the licensee challenges that Adjusted RBC Report, then the Authorized Control Level Event occurs upon notification that an administrative law judge has rejected the challenge; or (3) the failure of a licensee to respond to a Corrective Order in a manner satisfactory to the director, provided the licensee has not challenged the Corrective Order pursuant to Section 38-9-370. If the licensee has challenged a Corrective Order and an administrative law judge has rejected the challenge or has modified the Corrective Order, then the Authorized Control Level Event occurs upon the failure of the licensee to respond to that Corrective Order in a manner satisfactory to the director. (B) In the event of an Authorized Control Level Event, the director may take action pursuant to Section 38-9-340 or, if the director considers it to be in the best interests of the policyholders and creditors of the licensee and of the public, he may take action necessary to place the licensee under regulatory control pursuant to Section 38-26-10, et seq., or to Section 38-27-10, et seq. The Authorized Control Level Event is sufficient grounds for the director to take that action, and the director has the rights, powers, and duties detailed within those provisions of law.

If the licensee challenges an Adjusted RBC Report notification, then the Mandatory Control Event Level occurs upon notification that an administrative law judge has rejected the challenge. (B) In the event of a Mandatory Control Level Event: (1) For a life and health insurer, the director must take action necessary to place the insurer under regulatory control pursuant to Section 38-26-10, et seq., or Section 38-27-10, et seq. The Mandatory Control Level Event is sufficient grounds for the director to take that action, and the director has the rights, powers, and duties detailed within those provisions of law. If the director takes action, then the insurer is entitled to the protections afforded under those provisions pertaining to summary proceedings. The director, in his discretion, may forego action for up to ninety days after the Mandatory Control Level Event if the director finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the Mandatory Control Level Event will be eliminated within that period. (2) For a property and casualty insurer, the director must take action necessary to place the insurer under regulatory control pursuant to Section 38-26-10, et seq., or Section 38-27-10, et seq. If the insurer is not writing business and is running off its existing business, then the director may allow the insurer to continue its run-off under his supervision. The Mandatory Control Level Event is sufficient grounds for the director to take either action, and the director has the rights, powers, and duties detailed within those provisions. If the director takes action, then the insurer is entitled to the protections afforded under those provisions pertaining to summary proceedings. The director, in his discretion, may forego action for up to ninety days after the Mandatory Control Level Event if the director finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the Mandatory Control Level Event will be eliminated within that period. (3) For a health organization, the director must take action necessary to place the health organization under regulatory control pursuant to Section 38-26-10, et seq., or Section 38-27-10, et seq. In that event, the Mandatory Control Level Event must be considered an indication of a hazardous financial condition which serves as sufficient grounds for the director to commence delinquency proceedings, and the receiver appointed in conjunction with the proceedings has the rights, powers, and duties with respect to the licensee as are set forth in Section 38-26-10, et seq., or Section 38-27-10, et seq., or an order of liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation entered under it. If the director takes action, then the health organization is entitled to the protections afforded under those provisions pertaining to summary proceedings. The director, in his discretion, may forego action for up to ninety days after the Mandatory Control Level Event if the director finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the Mandatory Control Level Event will be eliminated within that period.
