The director or his designee shall approve or disapprove these filings pursuant to the provisions of Sections 38-73-960 and 38-73-990. (E) With respect to applications for rate increases for fire, allied lines, and homeowner's insurance that exceed the seven percent cap as provided in subsection (A) and if an applicant insurer had earned premiums in this State in the previous calendar year of more than ten million dollars for the line or type of insurance for which the rate increase is sought, the director or his designee shall provide a copy of the filing to the Consumer Advocate or, in the alternative, shall direct the insurer to provide a copy simultaneously to the Consumer Advocate. Within ten business days of the receipt of the filing, the Consumer Advocate may request from the insurer additional information. A copy of the request must be served on the director or his designee. Within ten business days of the receipt of the information sought, the Consumer Advocate shall inform the insurer and the director if, in his opinion, the filing is not in compliance with this chapter and specify in detail the reason for his opinion. If the filing is accepted by the director and becomes effective, the Consumer Advocate, upon good cause shown, may request a hearing before the Administrative Law Court. An order of the administrative law judge issued pursuant to the provisions of this section is on a prospective basis only and does not affect any contract issued or made before the effective date of the order. (F)(1) Nothing in this section prevents the director or his designee from considering the impact on individual territories or individual insureds when determining whether the rate is excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. Rate level increases or decreases falling within the limitation specified in this subsection must comply with the requirements of this chapter prohibiting rate increases from being excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. (2) With respect to fire, allied lines, and homeowner's rates, the director or his designee shall specifically review all rate filings made on or after June 1, 2007, to ensure that each insurer's rates for policies that exclude wind coverage reflect a discount commensurate with that insurer's previously filed surcharge for policies that include wind coverage. (3) This subsection does not apply to private passenger automobile insurance nor to insurance against liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or the use of: (a) an individual private passenger automobile as defined in Section 38-77-30(5.5)(a); or (b) property having wheels.

The insurer shall pay all or part of the deductible amount, whichever is applicable to a compensable claim, to the person or provider entitled to the benefits conferred by this chapter and then seek reimbursement from the insured employer for the applicable deductible amount. The payment or nonpayment of deductible amounts by the insured employer to the insurer must be treated under the policy insuring the liability for workers' compensation in the same manner as payment or nonpayment of premiums. (C) Optional deductibles must be offered in each policy insuring liability for workers' compensation which is issued, delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed after June 30, 1996, unless an insured employer and insurer agree to renegotiate a workers' compensation insurance policy in effect on July 1, 1996, so as to include a provision allowing for a deductible. (D) Premium reduction for deductibles must be determined before the application of any experience modification, premium surcharge, or premium discounts. To the extent that an employer's experience rating or safety record is based on benefits paid, money paid by the insured employer under a deductible as provided in this section must not be included as benefits paid so as to harm the experience rating of the employer. (E) This section does not apply to employers who are approved to self-insure against liability for workers' compensation or group self-insurance funds for workers' compensation established pursuant to the laws of this State.

Such residual market agreement and any mechanism designed to implement such agreement, and any amendments thereto, must be submitted in writing to the director or his designee for approval prior to use, together with such additional information as the director or his designee may reasonably require. Insurers that participate in the voluntary market shall participate in these mechanisms and shall pay their assessments, if any. (2) If, after a hearing, the director or his designee finds that any activity or practice of insurers participating in the residual market mechanism is unfair, unreasonable, or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the director or his designee must issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair, unreasonable, or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this title and require the discontinuance of such activity or practice. The director or his designee may establish, by written order, an assigned risk plan or mechanism if he finds that insurers have failed to agree pursuant to item (1), or to implement assigned risk agreements if the director or his designee finds that the existing residual market mechanism is unfair, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. (3) The servicing carriers for the workers' compensation assigned risk pool may be competitively bid as provided for in this subsection. If the workers' compensation assigned risk pool is competitively bid, then the director or his designee must appoint a committee or committees of individuals as he considers qualified to establish standards and procedures for the consideration and evaluation of bids. Insurers, or other vendors in conjunction with a licensed workers' compensation insurer, may submit bids. The committee or committees must evaluate and award contracts pursuant to the bidding process established by the committee or committees, subject to the final approval of the director or his designee. The director may require a bid fee to cover the expenses of implementing this section. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of this article, assigned risk pools must accept a policy of workers' compensation insurance on the basis that it provides coverage to a vendor who provides logging services to a named insured or on the basis that the policy provides coverage to an association of these vendors. (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A), no insurer may act as a servicing carrier for any assigned risk pool for workers' compensation insurance authorized pursuant to subsection (A) unless such insurer participates in the voluntary market for workers' compensation insurance in this State. (C) It is essential for maintaining the viability of the assigned risk plan to establish and maintain rates at a level which permits the plan to operate as a self-funded mechanism. The plan administrator shall maintain necessary rate making data in order to permit the actuarial determination of rates and rating plans appropriate for the business insured through the plan. All assigned carriers shall report their experience on business written under the plan to the plan administrator in a format prescribed by the plan administrator. The plan administrator shall monitor rate adequacy and plan results and shall notify the director of the Department of Insurance in the event that excessive losses are indicated so as to enable the director to take corrective action.

Any other increase request is subject to prior approval. A rate increase may not be implemented until the onset of the new policy period. (2) A rate increase or decrease falling within the limitation in subsection (A) may become effective no less than thirty days after the date of the filing with the director. The filing is considered to meet the requirements of this chapter unless the director or his designee notifies the insurer that the filing does not comply with this chapter within that thirty-day time period. If, after the filing becomes effective, the director finds the filing does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, the director shall issue a written order specifying in detail the provisions with which the insurer has not complied and state a reasonable period thereafter in which the filing is considered no longer effective. Any order by the director pursuant to this section that is issued more than thirty days from the date on which the director received the rate filing must be on a prospective basis only and may not affect any contract issued or made before the effective date of the order. (C) Rate filings for automobile insurance also may be made outside the limitation specified in subsection (A), however those filings are subject to the prior approval of the director. The director shall approve or disapprove these filings in accordance with the provisions of Sections 38-73-960 and 38-73-990. No more than two rate increases may be implemented during a twelve-month period. If the two rate increases fall above or below seven percent as specified in subsection (B), the second rate increase request within a twelve-month period is subject to prior approval.

Filings for these insurance premium rates must be made upon forms prescribed by the director or his designee and must apply only to essential property insurance premium rates for the coastal area. Within thirty days after the filing of the rates, the director or his designee must notify the insurer or rating organization filing the rates of his approval or his disapproval of those rates. If the rates are disapproved, then the director or his designee must notify the insurer or the rating organization of the specific reason for disapproval. The director or his designee may extend for up to an additional thirty days the period within which he must approve or disapprove the rates. Any rates received, which are neither approved nor disapproved by the director, must be deemed approved at the expiration of the thirty-day period or, if that period has been extended, at the expiration of the extended period. However, no insurer or rating organization may use rates considered approved under the provisions of this section unless and until the insurer or rating organization has filed a written notice of its intent to use the rates. The notice must be filed with the director or his designee at least ten days before the insurer's or rating organization's use of the deemed rates. (B) In considering any rate filing for insurance premium rates for essential property insurance in the coastal area or in the seacoast area, the director or his designee, in addition to other factors considered under this title, may consider past and prospective expenses and recoveries associated with catastrophe reinsurance and past and prospective loss experience including windstorm catastrophe models and simulations. (C) Rating plans for essential property insurance in the coastal area or in the seacoast area, shall include discounts and credits or surcharges and debits calculated upon the following rating factors: (1) use of storm shutters; (2) use of roof tie downs; (3) construction standards; (4) building codes; (5) distance from water; (6) elevation; (7) flood insurance; (8) policy deductibles; and (9) other applicable factors requested by the insurer or rating organization or selected by order of the director involving the risk or hazard. An order issued pursuant to this section must comply with the requirements of Section 1-23-140. The department may by regulation define how the implementation of these factors qualify for credits or discounts. The regulation must specify what evidence or proof the policyholder or applicant shall present to obtain the credit or discount. This section applies to policies issued or renewed after December 31, 2007. (D) This section does not preclude any insurer from using consent-to-rate pursuant to Section 38-73-1060 for any essential property insurance risk in the coastal area or the seacoast area of this State.

In lieu of an independent examination, the director or his designee may request a sworn affidavit from the insurer's controller, accountant, or actuary that the companies' expenses are being allocated and treated properly and that private passenger automobile insureds are not being charged an inequitable or unfair share of the insurer's expenses, acquisition costs, overhead, or other expenses.
