The filing or recording of the order with the clerk of court or the register of deeds of the county in which its principal office or place of business is located or, for real estate, with the clerk of court and the register of deeds of the county where the property is located imparts the same notice which a deed, bill of sale, or other evidence of title filed or recorded with that office would have imparted.\n\n(B) Upon issuance of the order, the rights and liabilities of the insurer and its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members, and other persons interested in its estate become fixed as of the date of entry of the order of liquidation, except as provided in Sections 38-27-380 and 38-27-560.\n\n(C) An order to liquidate the business of an alien insurer domiciled in this State must be in the same terms and has the same legal effect as an order to liquidate a domestic insurer, except that the assets and the business in the United States are the only assets and business included.\n\n(D) At the time of petitioning for an order of liquidation, or after that time, the director or his designee, after making appropriate findings of an insurer's insolvency, may petition the court for a judicial declaration of insolvency. After providing notice and hearing it considers proper the court may make the declaration.\n\n(E) An order issued under this section must require accounting to the court by the liquidator. Accountings must be at intervals the court specifies in its order.\n\n(F)(1) Within five days of the effective date of this subsection or within five days after the initiation of an appeal of an order of liquidation, which order has not been stayed, the director or his designee shall present for the court's approval a plan for the continued performance of the defendant company's policy claims obligations, including the duty to defend insureds under liability insurance policies during the pendency of an appeal. The plan must provide for the continued performance and payment of policy claims obligations in the normal course of events notwithstanding the grounds alleged in support of the order of liquidation including the ground of insolvency. If the defendant company's financial condition, in the judgment of the director or his designee, does not support the full performance of policy claims obligations during the appeal pendency period, the plan may prefer the claims of certain policyholders and claimants over creditors and interested parties as well as other policyholders and claimants as the director or his designee finds to be fair and equitable considering the relative circumstances of the policyholders and claimants. The court shall examine the plan submitted by the director or his designee and if it finds the plan to be in the best interests of the parties, the court shall approve the plan. No action may lie against the director, or his deputies, designees, agents, clerks, assistants, or attorneys based on preference in an appeal pendency plan approved by the court.\n\n(2) The appeal pendency plan may not supersede or affect the obligations of an insurance guaranty association. An appeal pendency plan must provide for equitable adjustments to be made by the liquidator to distributions of assets to guaranty associations, if the liquidator pays claims from assets of the estate, which otherwise would be the obligations of a guaranty association but for the appeal of the order of liquidation, so that guaranty associations equally benefit on a pro rata basis from the assets of the estate. If an order of liquidation is set aside upon appeal, the company must not be released from delinquency proceedings unless funds advanced by a guaranty association, including reasonable administrative expenses relating to obligations of the company, are repaid in full, together with interest at the judgment rate of interest or unless an arrangement for repayment has been made with the consent of applicable guaranty associations.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-5-2070 [1982 Act No. 384, Section 18] recodified as Section 38-27-370 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1991 Act No. 13, Section 21; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 616; 1997 Act No. 34, Section 1.",

If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then the transfers are considered preferences if made or suffered within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation or within two years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.\n\n(2) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:\n\n(i) the insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;\n\n(ii) the transfer was made within four months before the filing of the petition;\n\n(iii) the creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby or his agent acting with reference thereto had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or\n\n(iv) the creditor receiving it was an officer, employee, attorney, or other person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer, whether or not he held such position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five percent of any class of any equity security, as defined in Section 38-23-20, issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm's length.\n\n(3) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property, except where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he shall have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title passes to the liquidator.\n\n(b)(1) A transfer of property other than real property is considered made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(2) A transfer of real property is considered made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien is not considered to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.\n\n(4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation is considered made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.\n\n(5) This subsection (b) applies whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.\n\n(c)(1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, execution, or like process, whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.\n\n(2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section, if such consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. The lien could not, however, become superior and the purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of subsection (b) of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of the lien or subsequent to the purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action or ruling.\n\n(d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is considered under subsection (b) of this section made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' rights are performed within twenty-one days or any period expressly allowed by law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if the loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan has the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\n(e) If any lien considered voidable under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under this chapter which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien is also considered voidable.\n\n(f) The property affected by any lien considered voidable under subsections (a) and (e) of this section is discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order the lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that the conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\n(g) The circuit court has summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding must be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and, if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnified or than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within a reasonable time the court shall fix.\n\n(h) The liability of a surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation is discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and voided by the liquidator, or, where the property is retained under subsection (g), to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.\n\n(i) If a creditor has been preferred and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind for property which becomes a part of the insurer's estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would otherwise be recoverable from him.\n\n(j) If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it pays money or transfers property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or must be examined by the court on petition of the liquidator and may be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court. The excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate; however, where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate thereof, payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered is governed by item (iv) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(k)(1) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference when he has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the time of the preference is personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference. It is permissible to infer that there is reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was made within four months before the date of filing of the successful petition for liquidation.\n\n(2) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection (a) is personally liable therefor and is bound to account to the liquidator.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection (k) prejudices any other claim by the liquidator against any person.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-5-2170 [1982 Act No. 384, Section 28] recodified as Section 38-27-470 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1.",
