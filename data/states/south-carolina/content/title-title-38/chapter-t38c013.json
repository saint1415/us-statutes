When the director or his designee considers it prudent for the protection of policyholders in this State, he may examine or have examined an insurer applying for admission in this State. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope, and frequency of the examinations, the director or his designee shall consider compliance with relevant South Carolina laws and regulations, the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants, and other criteria set forth in the Financial Condition Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the director or his designee exercises his authority under this subsection. (B) The director or his examiners may conduct a market conduct examination whenever the director considers it appropriate based on the market analysis or practices of the insurer or HMO or other licensee as authorized by this title. The director or his designee has the discretion to conduct full scope or targeted, on-site market conduct examinations in accordance with the NAIC Market Regulation Handbook and other market analysis tools. The director is authorized to determine the frequency, depth, and timing of market conduct examinations and may schedule and coordinate multiple examinations simultaneously or participate in multistate examinations. (C) For purposes of completing an examination of an insurer under this chapter, the director or his designee may examine or investigate a person or his business in a manner considered necessary or material by the director or his designee. (D) In lieu of an examination under this section of a foreign or an alien insurer licensed in this State, the director or his designee may accept an examination report on the insurer prepared by the insurance department for the insurer's state of domicile or port-of-entry state if one or both of the following apply: (1) The insurance department at the time of the examination was accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program; (2) The examination is performed with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by the accredited insurance department, and who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their department.

      "text": "(A) Upon determining that an examination must be conducted, the director or his designee shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe South Carolina laws and regulations and those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The director also may employ other guidelines or procedures he considers appropriate. (B) Every person or insurer and his or its officers, directors, and agents from whom information is sought shall provide to the examiners appointed under subsection (A) timely, convenient, and free access at all reasonable hours at his or its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, and all computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the person or insurer being examined. If the director or his designee considers it necessary to the conduct of the examination, he may require that the person or insurer or his or its agents or affiliated or subsidiary corporations or partnerships furnish the original books and records. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the insurer or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of a person or an insurer by his or its officers, directors, employees, or agents to submit to examination or to comply with a reasonable written request of the examiners is grounds for suspension or revocation of the person's or insurer's certificate of authority to engage in the business of insurance in this State. The director or his designee may make the suspension or revocation and the reasons for it public. Proceedings for revocation must be conducted pursuant to Section 38-5-140. (C) The director or his examiners may issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and examine under oath a person as to matters pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the director or his designee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of court. (D) When making an examination under Section 38-13-10, the director or his designee may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners. The cost of the retainment must be borne by the insurer which is the subject of the examination together with the expenses of the director or his designee and the expenses and compensation of the director's assistants. If a domestic insurer has less than one million dollars total capital and surplus as of December 31, 1993, and thereafter, then it must not be assessed the actual examination costs but shall instead pay in accordance with the examination fee schedule in effect as of July 1, 1993. If an insurer determines that its examination fees have not been assessed as provided in this section or that the fees assessed are unreasonable in relation to the examination performed, the insurer may appeal the assessments to the Administrative Law Court. Examination fees must be retained by the department and are considered \"other funds\". (E) Nothing contained in Section 38-13-10 limits the authority of the director or his designee to: (1) terminate or suspend an examination to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this State. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to an examination are prima facie evidence in a legal or regulatory action; (2) use and, if appropriate, make public a final or preliminary examination report, examiner or insurer work papers or other documents, or other information discovered or developed during the course of an examination in the furtherance of a legal or regulatory action which the director or his designee, in his sole discretion, considers appropriate.

(B) No later than sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the department a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the insurer examined with a notice which affords the insurer a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to matters contained in the examination report. (C) After the expiration of the thirty-day period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the director or his designee shall consider and review the report fully with written submissions or rebuttals and relevant portions of the examiner's work papers and enter an order: (1) adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections. If the examination report reveals that the insurer is operating in violation of law, regulation, or prior order of the director or his designee, he may order the insurer to take action the director or his designee considers necessary and appropriate to cure the violation; (2) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners to reopen the examination to obtain additional data, documentation, or information and refiling pursuant to subsection (A); or (3) calling for an investigatory hearing with no less than twenty days' notice to the insurer to obtain additional documentation, data, information, and testimony. (D)(1) Orders entered pursuant to subsection (C)(1) must be accompanied by findings and conclusions resulting from the director's or his designee's consideration and review of the examination report, relevant examiner work papers, and written submissions or rebuttals. The order must be considered a final administrative decision and may be appealed to the Administrative Law Court as provided by law. The order may be served upon the insurer by certified mail or electronic mail, with a copy of the adopted examination report. Within thirty days of the issuance of the adopted report, the insurer shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and related orders. (2) A hearing conducted under subsection (C)(3) by the director or his authorized representative must be conducted as a nonadversarial, confidential investigatory proceeding as necessary for the resolution of inconsistencies, discrepancies, or disputed issues apparent upon the face of the filed examination report or raised by or as a result of the director's or his designee's review of relevant work papers or by the written submission or rebuttal of the insurer. Within twenty days of the conclusion of the hearing, the director or his designee shall enter an order pursuant to subsection (C)(1). (a) The director may not appoint an examiner as an authorized representative to conduct the hearing. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously with discovery by the insurer limited to the examiner's work papers which tend to substantiate assertions set forth in a written submission or rebuttal. The director or his representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents considered relevant to the investigation whether under the control of the department, the insurer, or other persons. The documents produced must be included in the record, and testimony taken by the director or his representative must be under oath and preserved for the record. Nothing contained in this section requires the department to disclose information or records which indicate or show the existence or content of an investigation or activity of a criminal justice agency. (b) The hearing shall proceed with the director or his representative posing questions to the person subpoenaed. After the questions the insurer and the department may present testimony relevant to the investigation. Cross examination may be conducted only by the director or his representative. The insurer and the department may make closing statements and be represented by counsel of their choice. (E)(1) Upon completion of the examination report under subsection (C)(1), the director or his designee shall hold the content of the examination report as private and confidential information for the thirty-day period provided for written submissions or rebuttals. Thirty days after the examination report has been submitted to it if the insurer examined has neither notified the director or his designee of its acceptance and approval of the report nor requested to be heard on it, the report must be filed as a public document and is open to public inspection, as long as no court of competent jurisdiction has stayed its publication. (2) This section does not prohibit the director or his designee from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report, or results or related matters to the insurance department of this or another state or country, or law enforcement officials of this or another state or agency of the federal government so long as the agency or office receiving the reports, results, or related matters agrees in writing to hold them confidential and in a manner consistent with Sections 38-13-10 through 38-13-60. (3) If the director or his designee determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an examination, he may initiate proceedings or actions provided by law. (F) All work papers, recorded information, documents, and their copies produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the director, his designee, or other persons in the course of an examination made under this chapter must be given confidential treatment, are not subject to subpoena, and must not be made public by the director, or other persons, except to the extent provided in subsection (E). Access also may be granted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The parties shall agree in writing before receiving the information to provide to it the same confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains has been obtained or unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The information may be provided to the consumer advocate as provided in Section 37-6-605 pursuant to an appropriate proprietary agreement to ensure confidentiality.

Notwithstanding a request from the director, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report to the director of the lead state for the insurance group in accordance with the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC. (B) The CGAD must include a signature of the insurer's or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors of the appropriate committee thereof. (C) An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the director's request. (D) For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level and the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at the level at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting. (E) The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information must be made through the lead state as determined by the procedures within the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook. (F) Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this article in other documents provided to the director, including proxy statements filed in conjunction with Form B requirements or other state or federal filings provided to this department, are not required to duplicate that information in the CGAD, but are required to cross reference the document in which the information is included.
