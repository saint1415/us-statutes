Membership also includes foreign and domestic risk retention groups and captive insurers authorized to write and report net-direct premiums for medical malpractice insurance, medical professional liability insurance, hospital professional liability insurance, or any other type of professional liability insurance in this State covering the professional liability risk of licensed health care providers, and authorized to do business in accordance with the provisions of this title. The South Carolina Insurance Reserve Fund is not a member of the association. Each insurer described above is and must remain a member of the association as a condition of the authorization to transact the sale of insurance in this State. The membership of the association shall continue as members in the South Carolina Medical Malpractice Association upon its creation as provided in Section 38-79-300. (2) The purpose of the association is to ensure the availability of medical malpractice and other types of professional liability insurance for health care providers on a self-supporting basis to the fullest extent possible. The intent of the General Assembly in enacting this section is to eliminate the accumulated deficit of the association and of the fund and to transition the association over time to a market of last resort so that it is no longer in competition with the private market. Specifically, the General Assembly does not intend that the South Carolina Joint Underwriting Association offer rates that are competitive to the private market.

Beginning on January 1, 2020, a uniform assessment of not less than two percent and not more than six percent of the net-direct written premium must be assessed against each member of the association in order to eliminate the accumulated deficits of the association and the fund. Association members must be notified of the assessment at least sixty days prior to each year end. After each quarter during the year following notification of the assessment, each member of the association must remit an amount equal to the assessment percentage of the previous quarter's direct written premiums. Monies derived from this assessment and collected must be distributed by the association to the accumulated deficits of the association and fund as determined appropriate by the director. Every member must directly recover from each policyholder one percent of the assessment and is authorized to recoup up to the remaining amount if they so choose. Amounts recouped under this section are not premium and are not subject to premium taxes, fees, or commissions. If one deficit is eliminated before the other, all subsequent monies collected must be distributed to the remaining deficit until it is eliminated. Assessments must cease when both accumulated deficits have been fully eliminated or on December 31, 2035, or whichever occurs first. Funds received by the association under this section will not be considered revenue or considered part of their operating income and will only be used to reduce the accumulated deficit. (2) Beginning on January 1, 2020, a surcharge on premium shall be assessed on association policyholders equal to the assessment percentage amount on members in any given year pursuant to the provisions of Section 38-79-220. Association policyholders will be notified of the surcharge percentage at least sixty days prior to each year end. Surcharges levied under this section are not premiums and are not subject to premium tax, any fees, or any commissions. Monies derived from this assessment and collected under this section must be distributed by the association to the accumulated deficits of the association and fund as determined appropriate by the director. Should one deficit be eliminated before the other deficit, all subsequent monies collected shall be distributed to the remaining deficit until it is eliminated. This surcharge shall cease when the accumulated deficits of both the association and the fund have been fully eliminated or on December 31, 2035, whichever occurs first. Funds received by the association under this section will not be considered revenue or considered part of their operating income and will only be used to reduce the accumulated deficit. (3) Each member shall remit to the association payment in full of its assessed amount under this section within thirty days of the end of each quarter. If a member fails to remit its assessed amount by the deadline, the association shall report the failure to the director or designee who may immediately take action to suspend or revoke such insurer's certificate of authority to transact the business of insurance in the State of South Carolina or issue a fine on that member until such time as the association certifies to the director or his designee that such assessment has been paid in full. The issuance of a fine, suspension, or revocation of an insurer's certificate of authority to transact business in the State of South Carolina shall not affect the right of the association to proceed against such insurer in any court for any remedy provided by law or contract to the association, including the right to collect such insurer's assessment. In addition to any other remedy, the association may offset assessments due from an insurer against any amounts in any account of such delinquent insurer. By mailing payment of its allocated amount of assessment, as provided herein, a member shall not waive any right it may have to contest the computation of its allocated amount of assessment. Such contest shall not, however, toll the time within which assessments must be paid or the report to be made to the director or his designee or affect or impede any action to be taken by the director or his designee upon receipt of such report. (4) Beginning January 1, 2020, all surplus lines insurance producers or brokers placing insurance through nonadmitted insurers shall collect from the insured and remit to the department to be distributed to the association and fund a nonadmitted policy surcharge on all premiums for all insurance written by such surplus lines insurance producer or broker for a policy from a nonadmitted insurer for any and all medical malpractice risks in this State. By procuring or selling medical malpractice insurance in this State from a nonadmitted insurer, each surplus lines insurance producer or broker placing insurance through a nonadmitted insurer agrees to be bound by the provisions of this chapter and to collect and remit the nonadmitted policy surcharge provided for herein. (a) The nonadmitted policy surcharge must be a percentage of the total policy premium, but the nonadmitted policy surcharge shall not be considered premium and is not subject to premium taxes or commissions. However, failure to pay the nonadmitted policy surcharge must be treated the same as failure to pay premium. \"Total policy premium\" includes taxes and commissions. (b) The nonadmitted policy surcharge percentage must be the same percentage as the assessment that has been approved by the board and director as applied to the insurers writing medical malpractice insurance, medical professional liability insurance, hospital professional liability insurance, or any other type of professional liability insurance in this State covering the professional liability risks of licensed health care providers as described in Section 38-79-220. (5) Within thirty days of the end of the quarter, surplus lines insurance producers or brokers placing insurance through nonadmitted insurers shall remit to the department all nonadmitted policy surcharges collected in the preceding quarter. Surplus lines insurance producers or brokers placing insurance through nonadmitted insurers may designate another surplus lines insurance producer or broker that actually procured the insurance from the nonadmitted carrier to collect and remit the nonadmitted policy surcharges. (6) Each insured in this State who directly procures or renews insurance with a nonadmitted insurer on medical malpractice insurance other than insurance procured through a surplus lines licensee, must be subject to the nonadmitted policy surcharge which must be paid by the insured according to the procedures provided for premium taxes in Chapter 45 of this title. Monies derived from the nonadmitted policy surcharge collected under this section must exclusively be used to reduce the accumulated deficits of the association and fund by equal amounts unless the director or his designee determines that different proportions are appropriate. Once the accumulated deficit of the association or the fund is eliminated, whichever occurs first, all subsequent monies collected through the assessment shall exclusively be used to reduce the remaining deficit until it has also been eliminated. The nonadmitted policy surcharge must continue until the surcharge provided in subsection (1) is eliminated. (7) The accumulated deficits of the association and the fund have accrued and persisted over a period of decades and being partially attributable to state agencies or institutions or their employees, until the director determines that the accumulated deficits of the association and the fund have been eliminated, he may receive appropriations that are explicitly provided for purposes of reducing the accumulated deficits of the association and fund.
