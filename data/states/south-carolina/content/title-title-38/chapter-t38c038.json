The payment is payable only out of the funds of the society and in a manner provided by its constitution and bylaws. (B) A person may be indemnified and reimbursed by a society for expenses reasonably incurred by, and liabilities imposed upon, that person in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, or threat of them, in which the person may be involved by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society or of a firm, corporation, or an organization which he served in a capacity at the request of the society. A person may not be indemnified or reimbursed (1) in relation to any matter in the action, suit, or proceeding as to which he is finally adjudged to be or to have been guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, or (2) in relation to any matter in the action, suit, or proceeding, or threat of them, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement unless, in either (1) or (2) of this subsection, the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The determination whether the conduct of the person meets the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in (1) or (2) of this subsection may be made only by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to that person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The right of indemnification and reimbursement is not exclusive of other rights to which the person may be entitled as a matter of law and inures to the benefit of his heirs, executors, and administrators. (C) A society is empowered to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another firm, corporation, or organization, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him in that capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against liability under this section. (D) A director, an officer, employee, a member, or volunteer of a society serving without compensation is not liable, and no cause of action may be brought, for damages resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion in connection with the duties or responsibilities of that person for the society, unless the act or omission involved wilful or wanton misconduct.

The articles of incorporation shall state: (a) the proposed corporate name of the society, which may not so closely resemble the name of a society or an insurance company as to be misleading or confusing; (b) the purposes for which it is being formed and the mode in which its corporate powers are to be exercised. These purposes may not include more liberal powers than are granted by this chapter; (c) the names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences, and official titles of all the officers, trustees, directors, or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control of the management of the affairs and funds of the society for the first year or until the ensuing election at which all such officers must be elected by the supreme governing body, which election must be held not later than one year from the date of issuance of the permanent certificate of authority. (2) The articles of incorporation, certified copies of the society's bylaws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications, and circulars to be issued by the society and a bond conditioned upon the return to applicants of the advanced payments if the organization is not completed within one year must be filed with the director or his designee, who may require further information he considers necessary. The bond with sureties approved by the director or his designee must be in an amount of not less than three hundred thousand dollars nor more than one million five hundred thousand dollars, as required by the director or his designee. All documents filed must be in the English language. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this chapter and all provisions of the law have been complied with, the director or his designee shall certify, retain, and file the articles of incorporation, and furnish the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members as provided in this chapter. (3) A preliminary certificate of authority granted under the provisions of this section is not valid after one year from its date or after any further period, not exceeding one year, as may be authorized by the director or his designee upon cause shown, unless the five hundred applicants required have been secured and the organization has been completed as provided in this chapter. The charter and all other proceedings under the charter become null and void in one year from the date of the preliminary certificate of authority, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society has completed its organization and received a certificate of authority to do business as provided in this chapter. (4) Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the director or his designee, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates, and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. A society shall not incur liability other than for the return of the advance premium, issue a certificate, or pay or allow, or offer or promise to pay or allow, a benefit to a person until: (a) actual bonafide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than five hundred applicants, and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society; (b) at least ten subordinate lodges have been established into which the five hundred applicants have been admitted; (c) there has been submitted to the director or his designee, under oath of the president or secretary, or corresponding officer of the society, a list of the applicants, giving their names, addresses, date each was admitted, name and number of the subordinate lodge of which each applicant is a member, amount of benefits to be granted, and premiums; and (d) it has been shown to the director or his designee by sworn statement of the treasurer, or corresponding officer of the society, that at least five hundred applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly premium as provided in this chapter, which premiums in the aggregate must equal at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars. The advance premiums must be held in trust during the period of organization, and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, the premiums must be returned to the applicants. (5) The director or his designee may make any examination and require any further information as he considers advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, the director or his designee shall issue to the society a certificate of authority to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to Section 38-38-550 and other applicable provisions of this chapter. The certificate of authority is prima facie evidence of the existence of the society as of the date of the certificate. The director or his designee shall cause a record of the certificate of authority to be made. A certified copy of this record may be given in evidence with like effect as the original certificate of authority. (6) An incorporated society authorized to transact business in this State at the time this chapter becomes effective is not required to reincorporate. HISTORY: 2000 Act No. 259, Section 1.",

The certificate, riders or endorsements attached to the certificate, the bylaws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant, and all amendments to each of these items constitute the benefit contract, as of the date of issuance, between the society and the owner, and the certificate must so state. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, must be endorsed upon or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application are representations and not warranties. A waiver of this provision is void. (B) Any changes, additions, or amendments to the bylaws of the society made or enacted subsequent to the issuance of the certificate bind the owner and the beneficiaries and govern and control the benefit contract in all respects as though the changes, additions, or amendments had been made before and were in force at the time of the application for insurance, except that a change, addition, or amendment does not destroy or diminish benefits which the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance. (C) A person upon whose life a benefit contract is issued before attaining the age of majority is bound by the terms of the application and certificate and by all the bylaws and rules of the society to the same extent as though the age of majority had been attained at the time of application. (D) A society must provide in its bylaws that if its reserves as to all or any class of certificates become impaired its board of directors or corresponding body may require that there be paid by the owner to the society the amount of the owner's equitable proportion of the deficiency as ascertained by its board and that if the payment is not made either (1) it must stand as an indebtedness against the certificate and draw interest not to exceed the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificates, or (2) instead of or in combination with (1), the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate. The society may specify the manner of the election in which alternative is to be presumed if no election is made. This provision must be disclosed in all certificates filed and approved by the director or his designee on or after the effective date of this chapter. (E) Copies of any of the documents mentioned in this section, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, must be received in evidence of the terms and conditions of the documents. (F) A certificate may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless a copy of the form has been filed with and approved by the director or his designee in the manner provided for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this State. Every life, accident and sickness, health, or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate issued on or after the effective date of this chapter must be filed with and approved by the director or his designee and shall meet the standard contract provision requirements not inconsistent with this chapter for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this State, except that a society may provide for a grace period for payment of premiums of one full month in its certificates. The certificate also shall contain a provision stating the premiums which are payable under the certificate. If the bylaws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate also shall contain a provision that a member expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership of insurance, has the privilege of maintaining the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium. (G) Benefit contracts issued on the lives of persons below the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate. A society may require approval of an application for membership in order to effect this transfer and may provide in all other respects for the regulation, government, and control of the certificates and all incidental and connected rights, obligations, and liabilities. Ownership rights before the transfer must be specified in the certificate. (H) A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned.
