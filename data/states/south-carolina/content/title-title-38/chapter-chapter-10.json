Investors in fully funded insurance securitization transactions provide funds that are available to pay the insurer's insurance obligations or to repay the investors, or both. The creation of protected cells is intended to be a means to achieve more efficiencies in conducting insurance securitizations.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 238, Section 2; 2001 Act No. 58, Section 15, eff May 29, 2001.",

      "text": "(A) A protected cell company may establish one or more protected cells with the prior written approval of the director of a plan of operation or amendments submitted by the protected cell company with respect to each protected cell in connection with an insurance securitization. Upon the written approval of the director of the plan of operation, which shall include, but is not limited to, the specific business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected cell, the protected cell company, in accordance with the approved plan of operation, may attribute to the protected cell insurance obligations with respect to its insurance business and obligations relating to the insurance securitization and assets to fund the obligations. A protected cell shall have its own distinct name or designation, which shall include the words \"protected cell\". The protected cell company shall transfer all assets attributable to a protected cell to one or more separately established and identified protected cell accounts bearing the name or designation of that protected cell. Protected cell assets must be held in the protected cell accounts for the purpose of satisfying the obligations of that protected cell.\n\n(B) All attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell and the general account must be in accordance with the plan of operation approved by the director. No other attribution of assets or liabilities may be made by a protected cell company between the protected cell company's general account and its protected cells. Any attribution of assets and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell, or from investors in the form of principal on a debt instrument issued by a protected cell company in connection with a protected cell company securitization, must be in cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.\n\n(C) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to that protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell company . Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this chapter, including assets transferred to a protected cell account, are owned by the protected cell company, and the protected cell company may not be, or may not hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of that protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the protected cell company may allow for a security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise allowed under applicable law.\n\n(D) This chapter may not be construed to prohibit the protected cell company from contracting with or arranging for an investment advisor, commodity trading advisor, or other third party to manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell, if all remuneration, expenses, and other compensation of the third party advisor or manager are payable from the protected cell assets of that protected cell and not from the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell company's general account.\n\n(E) A protected cell company shall establish administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify the one or more protected cells of the protected cell company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities:\n\n(1) separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities of the protected cell company's general account and;\n\n(2) attributable to one protected cell separate and separately identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities attributable to other protected cells.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if this subsection is violated, the remedy of tracing is applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell company's general account. The remedy of tracing must not be construed as an exclusive remedy.\n\n(F) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell company shall attribute to the protected cell assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to that protected cell.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 238, Section 2.",

All contracts or other documentation reflecting protected cell liabilities shall clearly indicate that only the protected cell assets are available for the satisfaction of those protected cell liabilities.\n\n(B) The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities must be credited to or charged against the protected cell without regard to other income, gains, or losses of the protected cell company, including income, gains, or losses of other protected cells. Amounts attributed to any protected cell and accumulations on the attributed amounts may be invested and reinvested without regard to any requirements or limitations of Chapter 12 of this title and the investments in a protected cell or cells may not be taken into account in applying the investment limitations otherwise applicable to the investments of the protected cell company.\n\n(C) Assets attributed to a protected cell must be valued at their market value on the date of valuation or if there is no readily available market, as provided in the contract or the rules or other written documentation applicable to the protected cell.\n\n(D) A protected cell company with respect to any of its protected cells, shall engage in fully funded indemnity triggered insurance securitization to support in full the protected cell exposures attributable to that protected cell. A protected cell company insurance securitization that is nonindemnity triggered shall qualify as an insurance securitization under the terms of this chapter only after the director promulgates regulations addressing the methods of funding of the portion of this risk that is not indemnity based and addressing accounting, disclosure, risk based capital treatment, and assessing risks associated with such securitizations. A protected cell company insurance securitization that is not fully funded, whether indemnity triggered or nonindemnity triggered, is prohibited. Protected cell assets may be used to pay interest or other consideration on any outstanding debt or other obligation attributable to that protected cell, and nothing in this subsection may be construed or interpreted to prevent a protected cell company from entering into a swap agreement or other transaction for the account of the protected cell that has the effect of guaranteeing interest or other consideration.\n\n(E) In all protected cell company insurance securitizations, the contracts or other documentation effecting the transaction shall contain provisions identifying the protected cell to which the transaction will be attributed. In addition, the contracts or other documentation shall clearly disclose that the assets of that protected cell, and only those assets, are available to pay the obligations of that protected cell. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection and subject to the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law or regulation, the failure to include such language in the contracts or other documentation may not be used as the sole basis by creditors, reinsurers, or other claimants to circumvent the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(F) A protected cell company only may attribute to a protected cell account the insurance obligations relating to the protected cell company's general account. Under no circumstances may a protected cell be authorized to issue insurance or reinsurance contracts directly to policyholders or reinsureds or have any obligation to the policyholders or reinsureds of the protected cell company's general account.\n\n(G) At the cessation of business of a protected cell in accordance with the plan approved by the director, the protected cell company voluntarily shall close out the protected cell account.\n\nHISTORY: 2000 Act No. 238, Section 2; 2012 Act No. 137, Section 5, eff April 2, 2012.",
