If replacement of insurance is involved, the policyholder is permitted to return the policy within a period of not less than twenty days of its delivery to the policyholder. If the policy was solicited by a direct response insurer rather than through a licensed insurance agent, the provision must state that the policyholder is permitted to return the policy within a period of not less than thirty-one days. The entire premium paid by the policyholder must be returned immediately to the policyholder;\n\n(c) a provision stating who is authorized by the insurer to waive, alter, or change any of the terms or conditions of the policy.

If a claim arises under the policy during the grace period, the amount of any premium due or overdue may be deducted from any amount payable under the policy in settlement;\n\n(j) a provision that the policy may be reinstated at any time within three years after the date of default in the payment of any premium, unless the policy has been surrendered for its cash value or unless the extended term insurance, if any, has expired, upon evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer and the payment of all overdue premiums and payment (or within the limits permitted by the then cash value of the policy reinstatement) of any other indebtedness to the insurer upon the policy with interest as to both premiums and indebtedness at a rate not exceeding eight percent a year compounded annually. However, acceptance of all or any part of a premium more than thirty days in arrears by the agent or company without requiring reinstatement application continues the policy in force without any lapse of coverage;\n\n(k) a provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy.

If other dividend options are provided, the policy must further state which option is automatically effective if the party has not elected some other option. If a policy specifies a period within which the other option may be elected, this period must be not less than thirty days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable.

The company may deduct from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan any existing indebtedness on or secured by the policy not already deducted in determining the cash value, including interest due or accrued, and any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and may collect interest in advance of the loan through the end of the current policy year. The policy must reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application for the loan. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, it must then be added to the existing indebtedness and bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, then the policy terminates, but not until at least thirty days' notice has been mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the insured or policy owner and to that of any assignee of record on file with the insurer. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for an automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect. No condition other than as provided in this subsection may be exacted as a prerequisite to any loan.

In applying the percentage specified in (iii) above, no nonforfeiture net level premium may be considered to exceed four percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section is the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n(2) The nonforfeiture net level premium must be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.\n\n(3) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values must initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, and present values must be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7) of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy must be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified by the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums must be equal to the excess of (A) the sum of (i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over (B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.\n\n(5) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, must be the sum of (i) one percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (ii) one hundred twenty-five percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n(6) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium must be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where (A) equals the sum of (i) the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, and (ii) the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, and (B) equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide the higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\n(8) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this article:\n\n(A) must for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (i) the Commissioners' 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or (ii) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners' 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors;\n\n(B) must for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners' 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and\n\n(C) must for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this section for policies issued in that calendar year. However:\n\n(a) At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.\n\n(b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by Section 38-63-520, must be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.\n\n(c) An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.\n\n(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners' 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners' 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance.\n\n(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables.\n\n(f) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners' Standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the department for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners' 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners' 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\nFor policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners' Standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners' 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without the Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners' 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the director approves, by regulation, any Commissioners' Standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfetiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(g) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners' industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the department for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners' 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners' 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\nFor policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual must provide the Commissioners' Standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners' 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners' 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the director approves, by regulation, any Commissioners' Standard industrial mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(9) The nonforfeiture interest rate is:\n\n(a) for policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate is per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year must be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law rounded to the nearest one-quarter of one percent, provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than four percent; and\n\n(b) for policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year must be provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values does not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.\n\n(11) After the effective date of this section, any insurer may file with the department a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this section for that insurer. If an insurer does not make that election, the operative date of this section for that insurer is January 1, 1989.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-7-91 [1982 Act No. 403, Section 7] recodified as Section 38-63-600 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Sections 730, 731; 2016 Act No. 148 (S.850), Section 3, eff April 21, 2016.",

Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary must be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of (a) the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and (b) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.\n\nThe basic cash value must be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after the anniversary. The effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in Section 38-63-530 or 38-63-570, whichever is applicable, must be the same as are the effects specified in Section 38-63-530 or 38-63-570, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that section.\n\nThe nonforfeiture factor for each policy year must be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in Section 38-63-570 or 38-63-600, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, the percentage:\n\n(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.\n\n(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in the preceding item (a) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.\n\nNo basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in Section 38-63-570 or 38-63-600, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.\n\nAll adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section must for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other sections of this article. The cash surrender values referred to in this section include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.\n\nAny cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment must be determined in ways consistent with the ways specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in Sections 38-63-520 to 38-63-540, 38-63-600, and 38-63-620.
