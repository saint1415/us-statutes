Member insurers shall receive credit annually for essential property insurance voluntarily written in the coastal area and their participation in the writings of the association must be reduced accordingly. The board of directors shall authorize the method of determining the credit. In order to receive credit for essential property voluntarily written in the coastal area, each member company shall submit its requests by March thirty-first of the year preceding the year for which credit is sought.\n\n(C) The assessment of a member insurer after hearing may be ordered deferred in whole or in part upon application by the insurer if, in the opinion of the director or his designee, payment of the assessment would render the insurer insolvent or in danger of insolvency or would otherwise leave the insurer in a condition so that further transaction of the insurer's business would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, members, subscribers, stockholders, or the public. If payment of an assessment against a member insurer is deferred by order of the director or his designee in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is deferred must be assessed against other member insurers in the same manner as provided in this section. In its order of deferral, or in necessary subsequent orders, the director or his designee shall prescribe a plan by which the assessment so deferred must be repaid to the association by the impaired insurer with interest at the six-month treasury bill rate adjusted semi-annually. Profits, dividends, or other funds of the association to which the insurer is otherwise entitled must not be distributed to the impaired insurer but must be applied toward repayment of an assessment until the obligation has been satisfied. The association shall distribute the repayments, including interest, to the other member insurers on the basis at which assessments were made.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-39-70 [1962 Code Section 37-776; 1971 (57) 744; 1983 Act No. 12] recodified as Section 38-75-370 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1992 Act No. 342, Section 2; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 793; 2006 Act No. 332, Section 30, eff June 1, 2006; 2007 Act No. 78, Section 10, eff June 11, 2007, applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006.",

Those applicants with a total annual adjusted gross household income of which does not exceed eighty percent of the median annual adjusted gross income for households within the county in which the person or family resides may be eligible for the maximum grant award amount. Applicants with a higher total annual adjusted household income may be awarded a lower amount.
