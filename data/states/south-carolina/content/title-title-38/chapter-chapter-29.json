The costs of the association's obligations may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights;\n\n(v) for purposes of this chapter, benefits provided by a long-term care rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract are considered the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity contract to which it relates.\n\n(4) In performing its obligations to provide coverage, the association may not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, reissue, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, or reissued, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that does not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-29-40 [1962 Code Section 37-1403; 1971 (57) 351] recodified as Section 38-21-40 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-17-40 [1962 Code Section 37-563; 1972 (57) 2776] recodified as Section 38-29-40 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 631; 2008 Act No. 348, Section 11, eff June 16, 2008; 2020 Act No. 121 (S.580), Section 1.A, eff March 24, 2020.",

The association may adopt alternative policies or contracts of various types for future issuance without regard to any particular impairment or insolvency;\n\n(B) alternative policies or contracts must contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in this State and provide benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. The association must set the premium in accordance with a table of rates that it adopts. The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but may not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy or contract was last underwritten;\n\n(C) any alternative policy or contract issued by the association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy or contract issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association;\n\n(vi) if the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy or contract, the premium must be actuarially justified and set by the association in accordance with the amount of insurance or coverage provided and the age and class of risk;\n\n(vii) the association's obligations with respect to coverage under any policy or contract of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative policy or contract shall cease on the date the coverage or policy or contract is replaced by another similar policy or contract by the policy or contract owner, the insured, the enrollee, or the association;\n\n(viii) when proceeding with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with Section 38-29-40.\n\n(3) Nonpayment of premiums within thirty-one days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative, or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the association's obligations under the policy, contract, or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy, contract, or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(4) Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the association. If the liquidator of an insolvent insurer requests, the association must provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premium collected by the association. The association is liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.\n\n(5) The protection provided by this chapter does not apply where any guaranty protection is provided to residents of this State by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this State.\n\n(6) In carrying out its duties, the association may, subject to approval by a court in this State, impose:\n\n(a) permanent policy or contract liens in connection with a guarantee, assumption or reinsurance agreement, if the association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association's duties, or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently averse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens, to be in the public interest;\n\n(b) temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or policy loans, or on any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans, or other rights by the association for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.\n\n(7) The association has no liability for any covered policy of a foreign or alien insurer whose domiciliary jurisdiction or state of entry provides by statute or regulation for residents of this State protection substantially similar to that provided by this chapter for residents of other states. In addition, the association has no liability under this chapter for covered policies of a domestic insurer for residents of another state unless the other state has a guaranty association that provides protection to South Carolina residents substantially similar to that provided by this chapter for residents of other states.\n\n(8) A deposit in this State held pursuant to Sections 38-9-80 and 38-9-90 or otherwise required by the director for the benefit of South Carolina creditors, including policy or contract owners, must be released to the domiciliary receiver upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of a member insurer in accordance with Section 38-9-150. The association is entitled to a portion of the deposit in an amount equal to the aggregate of policy or contract owners' claims for which the association has provided statutory benefits on behalf of the insurer and associated administrative expenses. The amount must be promptly paid to the association provided such payment does not prejudice the rights of a South Carolina policyholder or creditor of the insurer that is the subject of the liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings. Any amount so paid to the association and retained by it not used in fulfilling the association's obligations must be treated as a distribution of estate assets pursuant to applicable state receivership law dealing with early access disbursements. The director, the association, and other necessary parties are authorized to enter into agreements to effectuate the intent of this section.\n\n(9) If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time with respect to an insolvent insurer, the director shall have the powers and duties of the association under this chapter with respect to the insolvent insurer.\n\n(10) The association may render assistance and advice to the director, upon the director's request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(11) The association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this State with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning that which the association is or may become obligated to cover under this chapter or with jurisdiction over any person or property against that which the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association including, but not limited to, proposals for reinsuring, reissuing, modifying, or guaranteeing the covered policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The association also shall have the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person or property against whom the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise.\n\n(12)(a) A person receiving benefits under this chapter is deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations continuation of coverage or provision of substitute or alternative policies, contracts, or coverages. The association may require an assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred by this chapter upon that person.\n\n(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.\n\n(c) The association has all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, enrollee, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts.\n\n(d) If the preceding provisions are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations must be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or contracts, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(e) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights to, the person must pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts covered by the association.\n\n(13) In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may:\n\n(a) enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter;\n\n(b) sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any unpaid assessments under Section 38-29-80 and to settle claims or potential claims against it;\n\n(c) borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter. Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;\n\n(d) employ or retain such persons necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter;\n\n(e) take such legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims;\n\n(f) exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life insurer, health insurer, or health maintenance organization, but in no case may the association issue policies or contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter;\n\n(g) organize itself as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of the State;\n\n(h) request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request;\n\n(i) unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract, file for actuarially justified rates or premium increases for any policy or contract for which it provides coverage under this chapter; and\n\n(j) take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter.\n\n(14) The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.\n\n(15)(a)(i) At any time within one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, in each case under any one or more reinsurance contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers.\n\n(ii) To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer must make available upon request to the association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed, and notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contacts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts.\n\n(iii) The following applies to reinsurance contracts assumed by the association:\n\n(A) The association is responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, and is responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge policies, contracts, or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and must provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator.\n\n(B) The association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of any such amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy, contract, or annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of:\n\n(1) the amount received by the association; and\n\n(2) the excess of the amount received by the association over the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy, contract, or annuity less the retention of the insurer applicable to the loss or event.\n\n(C) Within thirty days following the association's election, the association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association must calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance contract as of the election date with respect to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver has received any amounts due to the association, the receiver must remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable.\n\n(D) If the association or receiver on the association's behalf, within sixty days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the election date that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, the reinsurer is not entitled to terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay premiums insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, and is not entitled to set-off any unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association.\n\n(b) During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date or until one hundred eighty days after the date of the order of liquidation if the election date does not occur:\n\n(i)(A) the association or the reinsurer does not have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation; and\n\n(B) the reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested;\n\n(ii) provided that once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations must be governed pursuant to this section.\n\n(c) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date, the association has no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract.\n\n(d) When policies, contracts, or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies, contracts, or annuities also may be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed, subject to the following:\n\n(i) unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred shall not cover any new policies of insurance, contracts, or annuities in addition to those transferred;\n\n(ii) the obligations described in this section no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and\n\n(iii) notice must be given in writing, return receipt requested, by the transferring party to the affected reinsurer no less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section supersede the provisions of any state law or of any affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the insolvent insurer or any other person. The receiver remains entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable set-off provisions.\n\n(f) Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section alters or modifies the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section abrogates or limits any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section gives a policyholder, contract owner, enrollee, certificate holder, or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section limits or affects the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. Nothing in this section applies to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks.\n\n(16) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner.\n\n(17) Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.\n\n(18) Venue in a suit against the association arising under the chapter is in Richland County. The association may not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter.\n\n(19) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, reissuing, or reinsuring policies or contracts, the association may issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(a) in lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for a fixed interest rate, a payment of dividends with minimum guarantees, or a different method for calculating interest or changes in value;\n\n(b) there is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and\n\n(c) the alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-29-70 [1962 Code Section 37-1406; 1971 (57) 351; 1986 Act No. 426, Section 5] recodified as Section 38-21-70 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-17-70 [1962 Code Section 37-568; 1972 (57) 2776; 1977 Act No. 69 Section 2] recodified as Section 38-29-70 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 326, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 631; 2020 Act No. 121 (S.580), Section 1.A, eff March 24, 2020.",

      "text": "(1) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at times and for amounts as the board finds necessary. Payment is due thirty days after written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest as set forth in the plan of operation.\n\n(2) There are two classes of assessments, as follows:\n\n(a) Class A assessments are made for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer.\n\n(b) Class B assessments are made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under Section 38-29-70 with regard to an insolvent or impaired insurer.\n\n(3)(a) The amount of any Class A assessment for each account must be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or non pro rata basis. If called on a pro rata basis, the board may provide that the assessment must be credited against future Class B assessments.\n\n(b) The amount of a Class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, must be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n(c) The amount of the Class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer must be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the director. The methodology must provide for fifty percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and fifty percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.\n\n(d) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account must be in proportion to the premiums received on business in this State by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became insolvent. In the case of an assessment of an impaired insurer, the assessment must be in proportion to the premiums received on business in this State for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers.\n\n(e) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification and computation of assessments under this subsection must be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty days after the assessment is authorized.\n\n(4) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred, in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer must pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.\n\n(5)(a)(i) The total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in one calendar year exceed four percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this State on the policies and contracts covered by the account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(ii) If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation must be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable account as calculated pursuant to this section.\n\n(iii) If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds must be assessed as soon as permitted by this chapter.\n\n(b) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.\n\n(c) If the maximum assessment for the life or annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then the board shall assess the other accounts for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum provided in this section.\n\n(6) The board may, by an equitable method established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future claims.\n\n(7) It is proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.\n\n(8) The association must issue to each member insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount of the assessments so paid. All outstanding certificates must be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in the form and for the amount and for a period of five years.\n\n(9)(a) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment must be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest.\n\n(b) Within sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest.\n\n(c) Within thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director.\n\n(d) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association.\n\n(e) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess must be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.\n\n(10) The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-29-80 [1962 Code Section 37-1407; 1971 (57) 351; 1986 Act No. 426, Section 5A] recodified as Section 38-21-80 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-17-80 [1962 Code Section 37-569; 1972 (57) 2776; 1977 Act No. 69 Section 3; 1980 Act No. 345, Section 2] recodified as Section 38-29-80 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 326, Section 2; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 631; 2020 Act No. 121 (S.580), Section 1.A, eff March 24, 2020.",

Records of these meetings must be made public only upon the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection limits the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under Section 38-29-140.\n\n(3) For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association is considered to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to Section 38-29-70(12). All assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies must be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subsection, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for those policies bear to the reserve that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(4) As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in this section and consistent with Section 38-27-530, the association and other similar associations are entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of a member insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association is entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets.\n\n(5)(a) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, policy and contract owners, certificate holders, and enrollees of the impaired or insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the impaired or insolvent insurer. In this determination, consideration must be given to the welfare of the policy and contract owners, certificate holders, and enrollees of the continuing or successor insurer.\n\n(b) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer may be made until and unless the total amount of assessments levied by the association with respect to the insurer plus interest has been fully recovered by the association.\n\n(6) The recovery procedure shall provide that:\n\n(a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of items (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection.\n\n(b) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\n(c) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions he received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.\n\n(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer.\n\n(e) If any person liable under item (c) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid are jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-29-130 [1962 Code Section 37-1411; 1971 (57) 351] recodified as Section 38-21-120 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-17-130 [1962 Code Section 37-574; 1972 (57) 2776] recodified as Section 38-29-130 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 631; 2020 Act No. 121 (S.580), Section 1.A, eff March 24, 2020.",
