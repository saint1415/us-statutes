If the association determines that there may be more than one claimant having a covered claim or allowed claim against the association, or any associations similar to the association in other states, under the policy or policies of any one insolvent insurer, the association may establish a plan to allocate amounts payable by the association in such manner as the association in its discretion considers equitable.\n\nThis obligation includes only the amount each covered claim is in excess of two hundred fifty dollars and is less than three hundred thousand dollars. However, the association shall pay the full amount of any covered workers' compensation claim. The association has no obligation to pay a claimant's covered claim, except a workers' compensation claim, if:\n\n(1) the insured had primary coverage at the time of the loss with a solvent insurer equal to or in excess of three hundred thousand dollars and applicable to the claimant's loss; or\n\n(2) the insured's coverage is written subject to a self-insured retention equal to or in excess of three hundred thousand dollars. If the primary coverage and self-insured retention is less than three hundred thousand dollars, the association's obligation to the claimant is reduced by the coverage or retention. The Guaranty Association shall pay the full amount of a covered workers' compensation claim to a claimant notwithstanding any self-insured retention but the Guaranty Association has the right to recover the amount of the self-insured retention from the employer. The association is not obligated to pay a claimant an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy or coverage from which the claim arises. A covered claim does not include any claim filed with the association after the final date set by a court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer, or any claim filed with the association more than eighteen months after the declaration of insolvency, whichever date occurs first; provided, however, that this provision shall be without prejudice to the filing of a claim with the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer or the filing of a claim with any other Guaranty Association or similar organization in another state. The association shall pay only that amount of each unearned premium which is in excess of one hundred dollars;\n\n(b) is considered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and, to this extent, has all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent. However, the association has the right but not the obligation to defend an insured who is not a resident of this State at the time of the insured event unless the property from which the claim arises is permanently located in this State in which instance the association does have the obligation to defend the insured;\n\n(c) shall allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the four accounts separately and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay:\n\n(i) the obligation of the association under item (a) of this section;\n\n(ii) the expenses of handling covered claims;\n\n(iii) other expenses authorized by this chapter.\n\nThe assessments of each member insurer must be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the calendar year preceding the insolvency on the kinds of insurance in the account bear to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year preceding the insolvency on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member insurer must be notified of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than one percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the insolvency on the kinds of insurance in the account. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available must be prorated, and the unpaid portion must be paid as soon after proration as funds become available. The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the payment of an assessment of any member insurer, if the payment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. Any member insurer serving in the capacity of a servicing carrier for the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility, the South Carolina Windstorm and Hail Underwriting Association, the Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association, or any other involuntary association must not be assessed for the premiums so written, but the assessment must be made directly against the facility, pool, joint underwriting association, or other association. Each member insurer serving as a servicing facility on behalf of the association may set off against any assessment authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of the claims by the member insurer;\n\n(d) shall investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which these settlements, releases, and judgments may be properly contested;\n\n(e) shall notify any person the director or his designee directs under Section 38-31-80(2)(a);\n\n(f) shall handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the director or his designee, but designation may be declined by a member insurer;\n\n(g) shall reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter;\n\n(h) may employ or retain persons necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the association;\n\n(i) may borrow funds necessary to effect the purpose of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation;\n\n(j) may sue or be sued; provided, however, that any action brought directly against the association must be brought against the association in the State of South Carolina as a condition precedent to recovery directly against the association;\n\n(k) may negotiate and become a party to contracts necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter;\n\n(l) may perform any other acts necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of this chapter;\n\n(m) may refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of the association in any account exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-31-60 [1953 (48) 493; 1962 Code Section 37-304; 1976 Act No. 732 Section 4] recodified as Section 38-65-60 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-19-60 [1962 Code Section 37-825; 1971 (57) 1001; 1976 Act No. 666] recodified as Section 38-31-60 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 402, Section 4; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 632; 1994 Act No. 366, Section 1; 1994 Act No. 517, Section 1; 2001 Act No. 82, Section 10, eff July 20, 2001.",

The expenses of the association or an association similar to the association in handling claims must be accorded the same priority as the liquidator's expenses.\n\n(4) The association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-19-90 [1962 Code Section 37-828; 1971 (57) 1001] recodified as Section 38-31-90 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 632; 2001 Act No. 82, Section 13, eff July 20, 2001.",

Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter must be reduced by the full limits of such other coverage as set forth on the declarations page and the association shall receive a full credit for such limits, or, where there are no applicable limits, the claim must be reduced by the total recovery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person may be required to exhaust all coverage and limits under the policy of an insolvent insurer.\n\n(a) A claim under a policy providing liability coverage to a person who may be jointly and severally liable with or a joint tortfeasor with the person covered under the policy of the insolvent insurer that gives rise to the covered claim must be considered to be a claim arising from the same facts, injury, or loss that gave rise to the covered claim against the association. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter must be reduced by the full and combined policy limits of all joint tortfeasers.\n\n(b) To the extent that the association's obligation is reduced by the application of this section, the liability of the person insured by the insolvent insurer's policy for the claim must be reduced in the same amount.\n\n(2) A person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or associations similar to the association must be required first to exhaust all coverage and limits in recovery from the association of the place of residence of the insured except that, if it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall be required first to exhaust all coverage and limits in recovery from the association of the location of the property, and, if it is a workers' compensation claim, he shall be required first to exhaust all coverage and limits in recovery from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter must be reduced by the full amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or associations similar to the association, and the association shall receive full credit for such recovery.\n\n(3) A person having a claim or legal right of recovery under any governmental insurance or guaranty program which is also a covered claim shall be required first to exhaust all coverage and limits in recovery under the program. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter must be reduced by the full amount of any recovery under the governmental insurance or guaranty program.\n\n(4) No claim held by an insurer, reinsurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association based on an assignment or on rights of subrogation, or otherwise, may be recovered from a claimant or asserted in any legal action against a person insured under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer or the association except to the extent the amount of the claim exceeds the obligation of the association under this chapter.\n\n(5) A person who has liquidated by settlement or judgment a claim against an insured under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer, and the claim is a covered claim and is also a claim within the coverage of any policy issued by a solvent insurer, must be required first to exhaust all coverage and limits provided under the policy issued by the solvent insurer before execution, levy, or any other proceedings are begun to enforce any judgment obtained against or the settlement with the insured of the insolvent insurer. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter, whether through settlement, judgment, or otherwise, must be reduced by the full limits of such other coverage as set forth on the declarations page of the policy issued by the insolvent insurer.\n\n(6) A person having a claim against an insolvent insurer under any provision in an insurance policy is limited to ten million dollars aggregate payout from the association.\n\n(7) A person having a net worth of greater than twenty-five million dollars and having a claim against an insolvent insurer under any provision in an insurance policy may not make a claim against the association.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-31-100 [1953 (48) 493; 1962 Code Section 37-309; 1976 Act No. 731; 1976 Act No. 732 Section 5; 1983 Act No. 85] recodified as Section 38-65-70 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-19-100 [1962 Code Section 37-829; 1971 (57) 1001] recodified as Section 38-31-100 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 402, Section 5; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 632; 2000 Act No. 235, Section 2; 2001 Act No. 82, Section 14, eff July 20, 2001.",
