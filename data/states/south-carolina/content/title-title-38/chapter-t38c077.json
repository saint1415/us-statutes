If this insurer has failed to comply with the cancellation or nonrenewal laws, the director may require that your policy be reinstated. However, the director is prohibited from making underwriting judgments. If this insurer has complied with the cancellation or nonrenewal laws, the director does not have the authority to overturn this action.\"; (5) must inform the insured of the possible availability of other insurance which may be obtained through his agent, through another insurer, or through the Associated Auto Insurers Plan.

This notice must: (i) inform the insured of the reduction or elimination by the coverage section in the renewal policy or certificate; and (ii) provide that it is a notice of coverage changes. The Notice of Reduction in Coverage does not amend, extend, or alter coverage provided in a policy. An insurer's Notice of Reduction in Coverage must be provided to the director or his designee upon request when investigating a consumer complaint or when otherwise requested.

However, nothing in this subsection may preclude the use of a territorial plan approved by the director. (B) No insurer shall cancel a policy except for one or more of the following reasons: (1) The named insured or any other operator who either resides in the same household or customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy has had his driver's license suspended or revoked during the policy period or, if the policy is a renewal, during its policy period or the ninety days immediately preceding the last anniversary of the effective date. (2) The named insured fails to pay the premium for the policy or any installment of the premium, whether payable to the insurer or its agent either, directly or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit. (C) There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against the director or his designees; any insurer, its authorized representatives, its agents, or its employees; or any person furnishing to the insurer information as to reasons for cancellation or refusal to renew, for any statement made by any of them in complying with this section or for providing information pertaining to the cancellation or refusal to renew. For the purposes of this section, no insurer shall be required to furnish a notice of cancellation or refusal to renew to anyone other than the named insured, any person designated by the named insured, any other person to whom such notice is required to be given by the terms of the policy and the director. (D) Within fifteen days of receipt of the notice of cancellation or refusal to renew, any insured or his attorney shall be entitled to request in writing to the director that he review the action of the insurer in canceling or refusing to renew the policy of the insured. Upon receipt of the request, the director shall promptly begin a review to determine whether the insurer's cancellation or refusal to renew complies with the requirements of this section and of Section 38-77-120 if the notice was sent by mail. The policy must remain in full force and effect during the pendency of the review by the director except where the cancellation or refusal to renew is for the reason set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section, in which case the policy terminates as of the effective date stated in the notice. Where the director finds from the review that the cancellation or refusal to renew has not complied with the requirements of this section or of Section 38-77-120, he shall immediately notify the insurer, the insured, and any other person to whom such notice was required to be given by the terms of the policy that the cancellation or refusal to renew is not effective. Nothing in this section authorizes the director to substitute his judgment as to underwriting for that of the insurer. (E) Each insurer shall maintain for at least three years, records of cancellation and refusal to renew and copies of every notice or statement referred to in Section 38-77-120 of this section that it sends to any of its insureds. (F) The provisions of this section do not apply to any insurer that limits the issuance of policies of motor vehicle liability insurance to one class or group of persons engaged in any one particular profession, trade, occupation, or business. Nothing in this section requires an insurer to renew a policy of automobile insurance if the insured does not conform to the occupational or membership requirements of an insurer who limits its writings to an occupation or membership of an organization. No insurer is required to renew a policy if the insured becomes a nonresident of South Carolina. (G) Any insurer who violates this section shall be subject to the penalties as provided in Section 38-2-10. If the director of the Department of Insurance or his designee finds that an insurer, agent, or broker is participating in a pattern of unfair discrimination, the director or his designee may impose a fine of up to two hundred thousand dollars. Provided, however, if the unfair discrimination is required by an insurer, only the insurer is subject to the penalty as long as the agent of the insurer has reported the pattern of unfair discrimination to the department. The director or his designee at any time may examine an insurer, agent, or broker to enforce this section. The expense of examination must be paid by the insurer, agent, or broker.

      "text": "(a) Any authorized agency may require, in writing, the insurance company at interest to release to the requesting agency any or all relevant information or evidence considered important to the authorized agency which the company may have in its possession, relating to any specific motor vehicle theft or motor vehicle insurance fraud. Relevant information includes: (1) pertinent insurance policy information relevant to theft or fraud under investigation and any application for a policy; (2) policy premium payment records which are available; (3) history of previous claims made by the insured; (4) material relating to the investigation of the loss including statements of any person, proof of loss, and any other evidence relevant to the investigation. (b) When an insurance company has reason to believe that a motor vehicle loss in which it has an interest may involve theft or a fraudulent claim, the company may notify, in writing, an authorized agency and provide it with any or all material developed from the company's inquiry into the loss; however, when this information includes possible evidence of motor vehicle theft or motor vehicle insurance fraud involving specifically named persons, the information in all cases may be furnished to the solicitor in the circuit where the loss occurred and he shall furnish the information to other authorized agencies if he considers the action appropriate. When an insurance company provides any one of the authorized agencies with notice of a theft or fraud, it is sufficient notice for the purpose of this article. (c) The authorized agency provided with information may release or provide the information to any agency asked to participate in the investigation. (d) Any insurance company providing information to an authorized agency has the right to be informed, upon written request, as to the status of the case by the agency within a reasonable time, as determined by the authorized agency. (e) Any insurance company or authorized agency which releases information, whether oral or written, and any person acting in their behalf, pursuant to this article, is immune from any liability arising out of the release.
