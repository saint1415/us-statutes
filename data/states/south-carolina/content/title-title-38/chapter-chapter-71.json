The refund must include statutory interest from the end of the year at issue until the date of payment. Payments must be made during the third quarter of the next year.\n\n(5) As used herein, the term \"loss ratio\" means the ratio of incurred losses to earned premium by number of years of policy duration, for all combined durations.\n\n(6) The reference in item (1) of this subsection to the \"anticipated (target) loss ratio standards contained in the original actuarial memorandum filed with the policy form when it was originally approved\" may not be considered or construed as evidence of legislative intent that the use of, or adherence to, such \"anticipated (target) loss ratio standards\" is approved or disapproved in any application for a rate increase for any policy form approved prior to the effective date of these amendments to Section 38-71-310.\n\n(F) Nothing in this chapter precludes the issuance of an individual accident, health, or accident and health insurance policy that includes an optional life insurance rider. However, the optional life insurance rider must be filed with and approved by the director or his designee pursuant to Section 38-61-20 and comply with all applicable sections of Chapter 63 and, in addition, in the case of a life insurance rider with accelerated long term care benefits, Chapter 72 of this title.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-410 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-471; 1962 Code Section 37-471; 1972 (57) 2593; 1976 Act No. 630; 1980 Act No. 337, Section 2] recodified as Section 38-71-310 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 316, Section 2; 1989 Act No. 24, Section 1; 1989 Act No. 90, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 753; 1998 Act No. 411, Section 6; 2001 Act No. 82, Section 23, eff July 20, 2001.",

This approval must be noted on or attached to this policy. No agent may change this policy or waive any of its provisions.\n\n(2) A provision as follows:\n\nTIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES:\n\nAfter two years from the issue date only fraudulent misstatements in the application may be used to void the policy or deny any claim for loss incurred or disability that starts after the two-year period.\n\nA policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (a) until at least age fifty or (b) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parenthesis may be omitted at the insurer's option) \"INCONTESTABLE\":\n\n(a) Misstatements in the application:\n\nAfter this policy has been in force for two years during the insured's lifetime (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), the company cannot contest the statements contained in the application.\n\n(b) Preexisting conditions:\n\nNo claim for loss incurred or disability that starts after two years from the issue date will be reduced or denied because a sickness or physical condition not excluded by name or specific description before the date of loss had existed before the effective date of coverage.\n\n(3) A provision as follows:\n\nGRACE PERIOD:\n\nThis policy has a _ day grace period. This means that if a renewal premium is not paid on or before the date it is due, it may be paid during the following __ days. During the grace period the policy will stay in force. [Note: Insert a number not less than \"seven\" for weekly premium policies, \"ten\" for monthly premium policies, and \"thirty-one\" for all other policies.]\n\n(4) A provision as follows:\n\nREINSTATEMENT:\n\nIf the renewal premium is not paid before the grace period ends the policy will lapse. Later acceptance of the premium by the company or by an agent authorized to accept payment without requiring an application for reinstatement will reinstate the policy. If the company or its agent requires an application, the insured will be given a conditional receipt for the premium. If the application is approved, the policy will be reinstated as of the approval date. Lacking such approval, the policy will be reinstated on the forty-fifth day after the date of the conditional receipt unless the company has previously written the insured of its disapproval. The reinstated policy will cover only loss that results from an injury sustained after the date of reinstatement or sickness that starts more than ten days after such date.\n\nIn all other respects the rights of the insured and the company will remain the same, subject to any provisions noted on or attached to the reinstated policy. Any premiums the company accepts for reinstatement will be applied to a period for which premiums have not been paid. No premiums will be applied to any period more than sixty days before the reinstatement date.\n\n[The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (a) until at least age fifty or (b) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue.]\n\n(5) A provision as follows:\n\nNOTICE OF CLAIM:\n\nWritten notice of claim must be given within twenty days after a covered loss starts or as soon as reasonably possible. The notice may be given to the company at its home office or to the company's agent. Notice should include the name of the insured and the policy number.\n\nOptional paragraph: If the insured has a disability for which benefits may be payable for at least two years, at least once every six months after the insured has given notice of claim, the insured shall give the company notice that the disability has continued. The insured need not do this if legally incapacitated. The first six months after any filing of proof by the insured or any payment or denial of a claim by the company will not be counted in applying this provision.\n\nIf the insured delays in giving this notice, the insured's right to any benefits for the six months before the date when the insured gives notice will not be impaired.\n\n(6) A provision as follows:\n\nCLAIM FORMS:\n\nWhen the company receives notice of claim, it will send the claimant forms for filing proof of loss. If these forms are not given to the claimant within fifteen days the claimant will meet the proof of loss requirements by giving the company a written statement of the nature and extent of the loss within the time limits stated in the Proofs of Loss section.\n\n(7) A provision as follows:\n\nPROOFS OF LOSS:\n\nIf the policy provides for periodic payment for a continuing loss, written proof of loss must be given the company within ninety days after the end of each period for which the company is liable. For any other loss, written proof must be given within ninety days after such loss. If it was not reasonably possible to give written proof in the time required, the company may not reduce or deny the claim for this reason if the proof is filed as soon as reasonably possible. The proof required must be given no later than one year from the time specified unless the claimant was legally incapacitated.\n\n(8) A provision as follows:\n\nTIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS:\n\nAfter receiving written proof of loss, the Company will pay _ [insert period for payment which may not be less frequently than monthly] all benefits then due for _ [insert applicable term for type of benefits].\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the time of payment of claims provision in health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-670(6) must read as follows:\n\nTIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS:\n\nAfter receiving written proof of loss, the Company will pay _ [insert period for payment which may not be less prompt than those set forth in Section 38-59-230] all benefits then due for _ [insert applicable term for type of benefits].\n\n(9) A provision as follows:\n\nPAYMENT OF CLAIMS:\n\nBenefits will be paid to the insured. Loss of life benefits are payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation in effect at the time of payment. If none is then in effect, the benefits will be paid to the insured's estate. Any other benefits unpaid at death may be paid, at the company's option, either to the insured's beneficiary or estate.\n\nOptional paragraph: If benefits are payable to the insured's estate or a beneficiary who cannot execute a valid release, the company can pay benefits up to one thousand dollars to someone related to the insured or beneficiary by blood or marriage whom the company considers to be entitled to the benefits. The company will be discharged to the extent of any such payment made in good faith.\n\nOptional paragraph: The company may pay all or a portion of any indemnities provided for health care services to the provider, unless the insured directs otherwise in writing by the time proofs of loss are filed. The company cannot require that the services be rendered by a particular provider.\n\n(10) A provision as follows:\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY:\n\nThe company at its own expense may have the insured examined as often as reasonably necessary while a claim is pending and in cases of death of the insured the insurer at its own expense also may have an autopsy performed during the period of contestability unless prohibited by law. The autopsy must be performed in South Carolina.\n\n(11) A provision as follows:\n\nLEGAL ACTIONS:\n\nNo legal action may be brought to recover on this policy within sixty days after written proof of loss has been given as required by this policy. No such action may be brought after six years from the time written proof of loss is required to be given.\n\n(12) A provision as follows:\n\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY:\n\nThe insured can change the beneficiary at any time by giving the company written notice. The beneficiary's consent is not required for this or any other change in the policy, unless the designation of the beneficiary is irrevocable.\n\n(13) A provision as follows:\n\nCONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES:\n\nAny provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the laws of the state in which the insured resides on that date is amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such laws.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-440 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Sections 37-473 to 37-484, 37-486, 37-487; 1956 (49) 2029; 1962 Code Section 37-474; 1980 Act No. 354, Section 2] recodified as Section 38-71-340 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 394, Section 3; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 759; 2021 Act No. 13 (H.3585), Section 5, eff April 12, 2021.",

However, the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of these provisions a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the director or his designee which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this section, or, at the option of the insurer, by appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions approved by the director or his designee.\n\n(1) A provision as follows:\n\nCHANGE OF OCCUPATION:\n\nIf the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation.

If the insurer fails to ascertain the amount of insurance which an applicant has in force, all policies issued by the insurer to the applicant remain in force and the insurer is liable for all benefits payable thereunder, unless the applicant has misrepresented the amount of existing coverage on the application.\n\nIn all cases where the applicant indicates that other life, accident, and health insurance is in force with the insurer or the insurer's company, the insurer shall provide the applicant with the total amount of existing coverage with the insurer or insurer's company within sixty days.\n\n(4) A provision as follows:\n\nINSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:\n\nIf there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision-of-service basis or on an expense-incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense-incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined.

In applying the foregoing policy provision no third-party liability coverage shall be included as \"other valid coverage\".]\n\n(5) A provision as follows:\n\nINSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:\n\nIf there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense-incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro ratio portion for the indemnities thus determined.\n\n[If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in item (4) of this section, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase \"OTHER BENEFITS\".

In applying the foregoing policy provision no third-party liability coverage shall be included as \"other valid coverage\".]\n\n(6) A provision as follows:\n\nRELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE:\n\nIf the total monthly amount of loss-of-time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss-of-time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro ratio amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time. [The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of the premiums (a) until at least age fifty or (b) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"valid loss-of-time coverage\", approved as to form by the director or his designee, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director or his designee or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organization.]\n\n(7) A provision as follows:\n\nUNPAID PREMIUM:\n\nWhen a claim is paid, any premium due and unpaid may be deducted from the claim payment.\n\n(8) A provision as follows:\n\nILLEGAL OCCUPATION:\n\nThe company is not liable for any loss which results from the insured committing or attempting to commit a felony or from the insured engaging in an illegal occupation.\n\n(9) A provision as follows:\n\nINTOXICANTS AND NARCOTICS:\n\nThe company is not liable for any loss resulting from the insured being drunk or under the influence of any narcotic unless taken on the advice of a physician.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-460 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Sections 37-485, 37-488, 37-489, 37-491 to 37-493, 37-495 to 37-497; 1956 (49) 2029; 1962 Code Section 37-475; 1980 Act No. 354, Section 1; 1981 Act No. 35, Sections 1, 2] recodified as Section 38-71-370 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 394, Sections 4-8; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 760.",

Such a group must comply with the following provisions:\n\n(i) It contains at least one thousand eligible employees.\n\n(ii) It establishes requirements for membership. However, the common group cannot exclude any small employer, which otherwise meets the requirements for membership, on the basis of claim experience or any health status-related factors, as defined in Section 38-71-840, in relation to the employee or a dependent of the employee.\n\n(iii) It holds an open enrollment period at least once a year during which new members can join the common group.\n\n(iv) It allows eligible employees and their dependents, upon initial enrollment and during subsequent open enrollment periods, to choose among health insurance plans offered through the group. Persons covered by a health insurance plan offered through the group which requires an enrollment period in excess of one year are eligible to choose among available plans upon the completion of the enrollment period.\n\n(v) It offers coverage under all plans offered through the group to all eligible employees of member small employers and their dependents. Coverage may not be offered only to certain employees of member small employers and their dependents except as provided in Section 38-71-1370(B) of this chapter.\n\n(vi) It does not assume any risk or form self-insurance plans among its members unless it complies with the provisions of Chapter 41 of this title.\n\n(vii) It has the option of using any type of rating arrangement with the health insurance plans and, at its discretion, premiums may be paid to the health insurance plans by the common group, by member small employers, or by eligible employees and their dependents.\n\n(A) Health insurance plans offered through the common group which rate each member small employer separately are subject to the laws governing small employer health insurance; and\n\n(B) Health insurance plans offered through the common group which rate the entire group as a whole must charge each insured person based on a community rate within the common group, adjusted for case characteristics as permitted by Section 38-71-940 and plan selection, and are subject to the laws governing group accident and health insurance.\n\n(viii) It may not act as an agent or engage in any activities for which an insurance agent's license is required.\n\n(ix) Before offering any health insurance plans through the common group, and annually thereafter, it registers with the department and demonstrates continued compliance with the subitems (b)(i) through (viii).\n\n(2) The benefits provided by the policy are based on some plan or plans precluding individual selection, except that insurance supplemental to the basic coverage may be available to persons insured under the policy.\n\n(3) For all groups, no evidence of individual insurability may be required at the time the person first becomes eligible for insurance or within thirty-one days thereafter. Nothing in this section precludes the obtaining of medical information with respect to the members of the group for use in determining the insurability of the group, but the information may not be used to exclude an individual from coverage. In addition, group health insurance coverage, as defined in Section 38-71-840 must adhere to the requirements of Section 38-71-860 prohibiting discrimination against individual participants and beneficiaries based on health status-related factors.\n\n(4) Except for group health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, the policies may contain a provision limiting coverage for preexisting conditions. The preexisting conditions must be covered no later than twelve months without medical care, treatment, or supplies ending after the effective date of the coverage or twelve months after the effective date of the coverage, whichever occurs first. Policies of disability income insurance may exclude coverage for disabilities beginning during the first twelve months after the effective date of coverage which result from a preexisting condition. Preexisting conditions are defined as those conditions for which medical advice or treatment was received or recommended no more than twelve months before the effective date of a person's coverage. However, whenever a covered person moves from one insured group to another, the insurer of the group to which the covered person moves shall give credit for the satisfaction of the preexisting condition period or portion thereof already served under the prior plan if the coverage is selected when the person first becomes eligible and the coverage is continuous to a date not more than thirty days prior to the effective date of the new coverage. Service under a probationary waiting period required by the employer is not considered to interrupt continuous service. The requirements with respect to limitations on preexisting condition exclusions for group health insurance coverage are described in Section 38-71-850.\n\n(5) Except as provided in item (1)(b)(vii) of this section, the premium for the policy must be paid by the policyholder from the policyholder's funds or from funds contributed by the insured persons, or from both.\n\n(6) A group policy or subscriber contract of accident and health insurance which is advertised, marketed, or designed primarily as a supplement to reimbursements under Medicare for the hospital, medical, or surgical expenses of persons eligible for Medicare must equal, and may exceed, the minimum standards for Medicare supplement policies as contained in regulations promulgated by the department.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-940 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-532; 1957 (50) 165; 1962 Code Section 37-532; 1971 (57) 518; 1976 Act No. 732 Section 6; 1982 Act No. 318] recodified as Section 38-71-730 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 339, Section 2; 1990 Act No. 362, Section 1; 1991 Act No. 131, Sections 6, 7; 1992 Act No. 283, Section 1; 1992 Act No. 286, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 767; 1994 Act No. 339, Section 17; 1996 Act No. 435, Section 1; 1997 Act No. 5, Sections 6 to 8.",

The policy may provide that the policyholder is liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro ratio premium for the time the policy was in force during the grace period.\n\n(b) A provision that the validity of the policy may not be contested after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue and that no statement, except fraudulent misstatements, made by any person covered under the policy relating to insurability may be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which the statement was made after the insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of two years during the person's lifetime nor unless it is contained in a written instrument signed by the person making the statement. The provision does not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon the person's ineligibility for coverage under the policy or upon other provisions in the policy.\n\n(c) A provision that a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder must be attached to the policy when issued, that all statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured are considered representations and not warranties, and that no statement made by any person insured may be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to the person or, in the event of the death or incapacity of the insured person, to the individual's beneficiary or personal representative.\n\n(d) A provision setting forth the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to furnish evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the insurer as a condition to part or all of the individual's coverage.\n\n(e) If the premiums or benefits vary by age, there must be a provision specifying an equitable adjustment of premiums or of benefits, or both, to be made in the event the age of a covered person has been misstated. The provision must contain a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used.\n\n(f) A provision that the insurer will issue to the policyholder for delivery to each person insured a certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which that person is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable, and a statement as to any family member's or dependent's coverage.\n\n(g) A provision that written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy. Failure to give notice within the time does not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it can be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give the notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.\n\n(h) A provision that the insurer will furnish to the person making claim, or to the policyholder for delivery to such person, such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not furnished before the expiration of fifteen days after the insurer received notice of any claim under the policy, the person making the claim is considered to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made.\n\n(i) A provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within ninety days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of the disability must be furnished to the insurer at intervals the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within ninety days after the date of the loss. Failure to furnish proof within the time does not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to furnish the proof within that time so long as the proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity of the claimant, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.\n\n(j) A provision that all benefits payable under the policy other than benefits for loss of time will be paid not more than sixty days after receipt of proof of the loss. Subject to proof of loss, all accrued benefits payable under the policy for loss of time will be paid not less frequently than monthly during the continuance of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of liability will be paid as soon as possible after receipt of the proof.\n\n(k) A provision that benefits for loss of life of the person insured are payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured. If the policy contains conditions pertaining to family status the beneficiary may be the family member specified by the policy terms. In either case, payment of these benefits is subject to the provisions of law of this State if no such designated or specified beneficiary is living at the death of the person insured. All other benefits of the policy are payable to the person insured. The policy also may provide that if any benefit is payable to the estate of a person or to a person who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the benefit, up to an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars, to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the person who is considered by the insurer to be equitably entitled to the benefit.\n\n(l) A provision that the insurer at its own expense may examine the person of the individual for whom claim is made as often as reasonably necessary while a claim is pending and in cases of death of the insured the insurer at its own expense also may have an autopsy performed during the period of contestability unless prohibited by law. The autopsy must be performed in this State.\n\n(m) A provision that no action at law or in equity may be brought to recover on the policy before the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the policy and that no such action may be brought at all unless brought within six years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.\n\n(n) In the case of a policy issued to a creditor, a provision that the insurer will furnish the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a certificate of insurance describing the coverage and specifying that the benefits payable first must be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness.\n\nHISTORY: 1988 Act No. 394, Section 10; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 768.",

The effective date of discontinuance may not be prior to midnight at the end of the third scheduled work day after the date upon which the notice is delivered.\n\n(d) In addition to the notice required under Section 38-71-870 or Section 38-71-675, any notice of discontinuance by the carrier shall include a request to the group policyholder or other entity involved to notify certificate holders covered under the policy or subscriber contract of the date when the group policy or contract will discontinue and advise that, unless otherwise provided in the policy or contract, the carrier is not liable for claims for losses incurred after such date. The notice also shall advise, when the plan involves certificate holder contributions, that, if the policyholder or other entity continues to collect contributions for the coverage beyond the date of discontinuance, the policyholder or other entity may be held solely liable for the benefits for which the contributions are collected.\n\n(e) The carrier shall prepare and furnish to the policyholder or other entity at the same time an appropriate sample notice form to be distributed to the certificate holders concerned indicating the effective date of the discontinuance and urge the certificate holders to refer to their certificates or contracts in order to determine what rights are available to them as a result of the discontinuance.\n\n(f) Every group policy, contract, or certificate issued subject to this article or under which the level of benefits is modified or amended shall provide a reasonable provision for extension of benefits in the event of total disability at the date of discontinuance of the group policy, contract, or certificate as required by the following subsections.\n\n(g) In the case of a group life plan which contains a disability benefit extension of any type such as premium waiver extension, extended death benefit in the event of total disability, or payment of income for a specified period during total disability, the discontinuance of the group policy, contract or certificate does not operate to terminate the extension.\n\n(h) In the case of a group plan providing benefits for loss of time from work or specific indemnity during hospital confinement, discontinuance of the group policy, contract or certificate during a disability has no effect on benefits payable for that disability or confinement.\n\n(i) In the case of hospital or medical expense coverages other than dental expense, a reasonable extension of benefits or accrued liability provision is required. The provision is considered reasonable if it provides an extension of at least twelve months under major medical and comprehensive medical type coverages and under other types of hospital or medical expense coverages provides either an extension of at least ninety days or an accrued liability for expenses incurred during a period of disability or during a period of at least ninety days starting with a specific event which occurred while coverage was in force such as an accident.\n\n(j) Any applicable extension of benefits or accrued liability must be described in any policy, contract, or certificate involved. The benefits payable during any period of extension or accrued liability are subject to the policy's, contract's, or certificate's regular benefit limits such as benefits ceasing at exhaustion of a benefit period or of maximum benefits. For hospital or medical expense coverages, the benefit payments are limited to payments applicable to the disabling condition only. However, the carrier may not charge any premium during any period of extension.\n\n(k) A replacement carrier is considered to be a succeeding carrier within the meaning of this section if the effective date of the coverage provided by it is sixty-two days or less after the date of termination of coverage of the prior carrier.\n\n(l) This subsection applies to the prior carrier.\n\n(1) The prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier is the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage.\n\n(2) For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, in all situations except the prior carrier's withdrawal from the large group market, the small group market or both markets in this State, the liability of the prior carrier for extension of benefits terminates at the earliest of the following:\n\n(A) The date the individual has full coverage for the disabling condition under a group health plan with similar benefits and that plan makes reasonable provision for continuity of care for the disabling condition.\n\n(B) The date the individual is no longer totally disabled.\n\n(C) The date the extension period required in subparagraph (i) expires.\n\n(D) The date of exhaustion of a benefit period of the payment of maximum benefits as provided for in subparagraph (j).\n\n(m) This subsection applies to all groups.\n\n(1) Each person who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits with respect to classes eligible and actively at work and nonconfinement rules must be covered by the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits. For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, nonconfinement rules are not permitted and absence from work due to any health status-related factor must be treated as being actively at work.\n\n(2) Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with item (1) of this subsection (m) nevertheless must be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan. Any reference in the following rules to an individual who was or was not totally disabled is a reference to the individual's status immediately prior to the date the succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective.\n\n(A) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier must be the applicable level of benefits of the succeeding carrier's plan reduced by any benefits payable by the prior plan.\n\n(B) Coverage must be provided by the succeeding carrier until at least the earliest of the following dates:\n\n(i) The date the individual becomes eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan as described in item (1) of this subsection (m).\n\n(ii) For each type of coverage, the date the individual's coverage would terminate in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan provisions applicable to individual termination of coverage, such as at termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible dependent, as the case may be.\n\n(iii) In the case of an individual who was totally disabled, and in the case of a type of coverage for which subsections (f) through (j) of this section require an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the end of any period of extension or accrued liability which is required of the prior carrier by those subsections or, if the prior carrier's policy or contract is not subject to those subsections, would have been required of that carrier had its policy or contract been subject to those subsections at the time the prior plan was discontinued and replaced by the succeeding carrier's plan.\n\n(3) For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, in the case of an individual who was totally disabled at the time the prior plan was discontinued and replaced by a group health plan with similar benefits, and in the case in which subsection (1) requires an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier must be the applicable level of benefits of the succeeding carrier's plan. This benefit may be reduced by any benefits paid by the prior plan.\n\n(4) In the case of a preexisting conditions limitation included in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits applicable to preexisting conditions of persons becoming covered by the succeeding carrier's plan in accordance with this subsection (m) during the period of time this limitation applies under the new plan must be the lesser of:\n\n(A) the benefits of the new plan determined without application of the preexisting conditions limitation; and\n\n(B) the benefits of the prior plan.\n\n(5) The succeeding carrier, in applying any deductibles, coinsurance amounts applicable to the out-of-pocket maximums or waiting periods in its plan, shall give credit for the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the same or similar provisions under a prior plan providing similar benefits. In the case of deductible provisions or coinsurance amounts applicable to the out-of-pocket maximums, the credit must apply for the same or overlapping benefit periods and must be given for expenses actually incurred and applied against the deductible provisions or to the out-of-pocket maximums of the prior carrier's plan during the ninety days preceding the effective date of the succeeding carrier's plan but only to the extent these expenses are recognized under the terms of the succeeding carrier's plan and are subject to similar deductible or coinsurance provisions.\n\n(6) In any situation where a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this section, benefits of the prior plan are determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination must be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-941 [1985 Act No. 131, Section 1] recodified as Section 38-71-760 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1991 Act No. 131, Sections 8, 9; 2002 Act No. 228, Section 9, eff 90 days after approval by the Governor (approved May 1, 2002).",

A group policy is considered to be a successor policy within the meaning of this section if the effective date of the coverage provided by it is sixty-two days or less after the date of termination of coverage of the prior carrier. The employee or member is not entitled to have his coverage continued if the employee or member was entitled under federal law to continuation of his coverage for a period of greater duration than provided by this section. Continuation of coverage is subject to the group policy or a successor policy remaining in force and the employee paying the entire group premium, including any portion usually paid by the former employer, before the date each month that the group policy month begins. Policies which provide benefits for other than hospital, surgical, major medical, or which provide benefits for specific diseases or accidental injuries only are not affected by this section.\n\nA notification of the privilege to continue coverage after termination must be included in each certificate of coverage. In addition, the employer shall clearly and meaningfully advise an employee upon termination of the right to continue insurance and shall advise the employee of the amount of premium required and of the employee's responsibility to pay the premium each month before the date that the policy month begins. An employee is not entitled to continue coverage under the group if eligible for other group coverage which provides similar benefits nor if the person is eligible for medicare benefits provided by Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act or of any successor acts. Any benefits, except extended benefits payable by the policy during the period of continuation, are considered secondary to benefits under any other group health policy that is in force on a person insured through this continuation privilege.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-35-946 [1978 Act No. 547, 1979 Act No. 149 Section 1] recodified as Section 38-71-770 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1989 Act No. 127, Section 9; 1991 Act No. 131, Section 10.",

In addition, the program shall have the specific authority to:\n\n(1) enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this article, including the authority, with the approval of the director, to enter into contracts with similar programs of other states for the joint performance of common functions or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions;\n\n(2) sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any assessments and penalties for, on behalf of, or against the program or any reinsuring insurers;\n\n(3) take any legal action necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the program;\n\n(4) define the health insurance plans for which reinsurance will be provided, and to issue reinsurance policies, in accordance with the requirements of this article;\n\n(5) establish rules, conditions, and procedures for reinsuring risks under the program;\n\n(6) establish actuarial functions as appropriate for the operation of the program;\n\n(7) assess reinsuring insurers in accordance with the provisions of subsection (K), and make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for organizational and interim operating expenses. Any interim assessments shall be credited as offsets against any regular assessments due following the close of the fiscal year;\n\n(8) appoint appropriate legal, actuarial, and other committees as necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the program, policy and other contract design, and any other function within the authority of the program;\n\n(9) borrow money to effect the purposes of the program. Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the program not in default shall be legal investments for insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;\n\n(H) A reinsuring insurer may reinsure with the program as provided for in this subsection:\n\n(1) with respect to any health insurance plan offered by the small employer insurer to small employers, the program shall reinsure the level of coverage as defined in the plan of operation;\n\n(2) a small employer insurer may reinsure an entire employer group within sixty days of the commencement of the group's coverage under a health insurance plan;\n\n(3) a reinsuring insurer may reinsure an eligible employee or dependent within a period of sixty days following the commencement of the coverage with the small employer. A newly-eligible employee or dependent of the reinsured small employer may be reinsured within sixty days of the commencement of his coverage;\n\n(4)(a) the program shall not reimburse a reinsuring insurer with respect to the claims of a reinsured employee or dependent until the insurer has incurred an initial level of claims for such employee or dependent of five thousand dollars in a calendar year for benefits covered by the program. In addition, the reinsuring insurer shall be responsible for ten percent of the next fifty thousand dollars of benefit payments during a calendar year and the program shall reinsure the remainder. A reinsuring insurers' liability under this subparagraph shall not exceed a maximum limit of ten thousand dollars in any one calendar year with respect to any reinsured individual;\n\n(b) the board annually may adjust the initial level of claims, the coinsurance percentage, and the maximum limit to be retained by the insurer with the approval of the director.\n\n(5) a small employer insurer may terminate reinsurance with the program for one or more of the reinsured employees or dependents of a small employer on any anniversary of the health insurance plan;\n\n(6) a reinsuring insurer shall apply all managed care and claims handling techniques, including utilization review, individual case management, preferred provider provisions, and other managed care provisions or methods of operation consistently with respect to reinsured and nonreinsured business.\n\n(I)(1) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining premium rates to be charged by the program for reinsuring small employers and individuals pursuant to this section. The methodology must contain a provision surcharging the reinsurance premium rate of a small employer insurer which does not employ effective cost containment and managed care arrangements including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) preferred provider organizations;\n\n(b) utilization review;\n\n(c) case management;\n\nThe methodology shall include a system for classification of small employers that reflects the types of case characteristics commonly used by small employer insurers in the State. The methodology shall provide for the development of base reinsurance premium rates which shall be multiplied by the factors set forth in item (2) to determine the premium rates for the program. The base reinsurance premium rates shall be established by the board, subject to the approval of the director, and shall be set at levels which reasonably approximate gross premiums charged to small employers by small employer insurers for health insurance plans with benefits similar to the standard health insurance plan.\n\n(2) Premiums for the program shall be as follows:\n\n(a) An entire small employer group may be reinsured for a rate that is one and one-half times the base reinsurance premium rate for the group established pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n(b) An eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured for a rate that is five times the base reinsurance premium rate for the individual established pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n(3) The board periodically shall review the methodology established under item (1), including the system of classification and any rating factors, to assure that it reasonably reflects the claims experience of the program. The board may propose changes to the methodology which shall be subject to the approval of the director.\n\n(J) If a health insurance plan for a small employer is entirely or partially reinsured with the program, the premium charged to the small employer for any rating period for the coverage issued shall meet the requirements relating to premium rates set forth in Section 38-71-910, et seq.\n\n(K)(1) Before March first of each year, the board shall determine and report to the director the program net loss for the previous calendar year, including administrative expenses and incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses.\n\n(2) Any net loss for the year shall be recouped by assessments of reinsuring insurers.\n\n(a) The board shall establish, as part of the plan of operation, a formula by which to make assessments against reinsuring insurers. The assessment formula shall be based on:\n\n(i) each reinsuring insurer's share of the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers; and\n\n(ii) each reinsuring insurer's share of the premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from newly-issued health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery during the calendar year to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers.\n\n(b) The formula established pursuant to subitem (a) shall not result in any reinsuring insurer having an assessment share that is less than fifty percent nor more than one hundred fifty percent of an amount which is based on the proportion of the reinsuring insurer's total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers to the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by all reinsuring insurers.\n\n(c) The board may, with approval of the director, change the assessment formula established pursuant to subitem (a) from time to time as appropriate. The board may provide for the shares of the assessment base attributable to total premium and to the previous year's premium to vary during a transition period.\n\n(d) Subject to the approval of the director, the board shall make an adjustment to the assessment formula for reinsuring insurers that are approved health maintenance organizations which are federally qualified under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300, et seq., to the extent, if any, that restrictions are placed on them that are not imposed on other small employer insurers.\n\n(3)(a) Before March first of each year, the board shall determine and file with the director an estimate of the assessments needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year.\n\n(b) If the board determines that the assessments needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year will exceed the amount specified in subitem (c), the board shall evaluate the operation of the program and report its findings, including any recommendations for changes to the plan of operation, to the director within ninety days following the end of the calendar year in which the losses were incurred. The evaluation shall include an estimate of future assessments and consideration of the administrative costs of the program, the appropriateness of the premiums charged, the level of insurer retention under the program, and the costs of coverage for small employers. If the board fails to file a report with the director within ninety days following the end of the applicable calendar year, the director may evaluate the operations of the program and implement such amendments to the plan of operation the director considers necessary to reduce future losses and assessments.\n\n(c) For any calendar year, the amount specified in this subparagraph is five percent of total premiums earned in the previous calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers.\n\n(4) If assessments exceed net losses of the program, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce program premiums. As used in this item, \"future losses\" includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims.\n\n(5) Each reinsuring insurer's proportion of the assessment shall be determined annually by the board based on annual statements and other reports considered necessary by the board and filed by the reinsuring insurers with the board.\n\n(6) The plan of operation shall provide for the imposition of an interest penalty for late payment of assessments.\n\n(7) A reinsuring insurer may seek from the director a deferment from all or part of an assessment imposed by the board. The director may defer all or part of the assessment of a reinsuring insurer if the director determines that the payment of the assessment would place the reinsuring insurer in a financially impaired condition. If all or part of an assessment against a reinsuring insurer is deferred, the amount deferred shall be assessed against the other participating insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessment set forth in this subsection. The reinsuring insurer receiving the deferment shall remain liable to the program for the amount deferred and shall be prohibited from reinsuring any individuals or groups with the program until such time as it pays the assessments.\n\n(L) Neither the participation in the program as reinsuring insurers, the establishment of rates, forms, or procedures, nor any other joint or collective action required by this article shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil liability, or penalty against the program or any of its reinsuring insurers either jointly or separately.\n\n(M) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall develop standards setting forth the manner and levels of compensation, if any, to be paid to agents for the sale of basic and standard health insurance plans. In establishing such standards, the board shall take into consideration the need to assure the broad availability of coverages, the objectives of the program, the time and effort expended in placing the coverage, the need to provide on-going service to the small employer, the levels of compensation currently used in the industry, and the overall costs of coverage to small employers selecting these plans.\n\n(N) The program shall be exempt from any and all taxes.\n\nHISTORY: 1994 Act No. 339, Section 11; 1997 Act No. 5, Section 15; 2006 Act No. 332, Section 7, eff June 1, 2006.",
