The department shall promulgate regulations setting forth qualifying standards of producers as to all lines of business and shall require the producer applicant to stand a written examination. For the purpose of interstate reciprocity, the department shall identify by bulletin which limited lines insurance are approved in South Carolina and which are exempt from examination. A bank, finance company, or other company handling credit transactions operating in this State and utilizing one or more credit life or accident and health or credit property producers in a particular geographical area who are licensed without having taken the written examination is required to have readily available at least one credit life or accident and health or credit property producer to answer customers' questions concerning credit life, credit accident and health insurance, or credit property, or any combination of these.\n\n(B) A resident individual applying for an insurance producer license shall pass an examination. The examination must test the knowledge of the individual concerning the lines of authority for which application is made, the duties and responsibilities of an insurance producer, and the insurance laws and regulations of this State. The examination required by this section must be developed and conducted under regulations prescribed by the director or his designee.\n\n(C) The director or his designee may make arrangements, including contracting with an outside testing service, for administering licensing examinations.\n\n(D) Each individual applying for a licensing examination shall remit a nonrefundable examination fee as required by the licensing exam administrator.\n\n(E) An individual who fails to appear for the examination as scheduled or fails to pass the examination, shall reapply for an examination and remit all required fees and forms before being rescheduled for another examination.\n\n(F) A person applying for a resident insurance producer license or a person applying on behalf of the applicant shall make application to the director or his designee on the Uniform Application and declare under penalty of refusal, suspension, or revocation of the license that the statements made in the application are true, correct, and complete to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief. Before approving the application, the director or his designee shall find that the applicant:\n\n(1) is at least eighteen years of age;\n\n(2) is a person of good moral character and has not been convicted of a felony or any act within the last ten years that is a ground for denial, suspension, or revocation as provided for in Section 38-43-130 or been convicted of a misdemeanor involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or other financial- or insurance-related crime within five years;\n\n(3) has paid the fees provided for in Section 38-43-80; and\n\n(4) has successfully passed the examination or examinations for the line or lines of insurance for which the person has applied.\n\n(5) Before a license is issued to an applicant or is renewed permitting him to act as a resident producer, the applicant shall comply with the licensing and renewal requirements set forth in this section and by regulation. In addition to those licensing requirements, the applicant shall:\n\n(a) furnish a complete set of his fingerprints and the required fees and information in accordance with this subsection to the director or his designee. Failure to furnish the complete set of fingerprints and required fees constitutes grounds for denial of an application for licensure. However, the director may waive the fingerprinting requirements if it is impossible for the applicant to provide fingerprints due to a medically certified physical injury; and\n\n(b) undergo a state criminal records check, supported by his fingerprints, by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and a national criminal records check, supported by his fingerprints, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The results of these criminal records checks must be reported to the department. SLED is authorized to retain the fingerprints for use in identification purposes including, but not limited to, unsolved latent prints.

Application must be made using the Uniform Business Entity Application. Before approving the application, the director or his designee shall find that:\n\n(1) the agency has paid the fees as prescribed by Section 38-43-80; and\n\n(2) the agency has designated a licensed producer or other person responsible for the business entity's compliance with the insurance laws, rules, and regulations of this State.\n\n(J) The director or his designee may require any documents reasonably necessary to verify the information contained in an application.\n\n(K) The agency's license must contain the licensee's name, address, personal identification number, the date of issuance, and other information the director or his designee considers necessary.\n\n(L) Each insurer that sells, solicits, or negotiates any form of credit insurance shall provide to each individual whose duties include selling, soliciting, or negotiating credit insurance, a program of instruction that has been filed with the director or his designee.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-43-100 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-659; 1962 Code Section 37-659] recodified as Section 38-73-80 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-51-110 [1947 (45) 322; 1950 (46) 2268; 1952 Code Section 37-236; 1962 Code Section 37-236; 1985 Act No. 139] recodified as Section 38-43-100 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 659; 2002 Act No. 323, Section 2, eff January 31, 2003; 2003 Act No. 73, Section 10, eff June 25, 2003; 2004 Act No. 291, Section 1.A, eff January 1, 2005; 2008 Act No. 326, Section 5, eff June 16, 2008; 2016 Act No. 194 (H.4817), Section 8, eff May 26, 2016; 2017 Act No. 55 (S.463), Section 2, eff May 19, 2017; 2018 Act No. 158 (H.4654), Section 1, eff April 17, 2018.",

A person who falsely represents that he or another person has met the continuing insurance education requirements of this section, after being afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing by the Administrative Law Court, is subject to the penalties provided in Section 38-2-10.\n\n(2) However, if a producer is licensed in both property and casualty and life, accident and health, the producer shall complete at least one-third of the twenty-four required biennial continuing insurance education hours in courses related to each of these types of licenses or qualification for licensure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or another provision of law, a maximum of eighteen credit hours earned may be carried forward to the next biennial continuing insurance education period, as long as the hours carried forward are in excess of the required minimum for a particular reporting period.\n\n(3) However, a licensed resident producer who has obtained one of the following designations may use the credit hours earned to maintain the designation toward the fulfillment of the twenty-four hour requirement: Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU), Fellow, Life Management Institute (FLMI), Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Life Underwriter Training Council Fellow (LUTCF), Registered Health Underwriter (RHU), Registered Employee Benefit Consultant (REBC), or Chartered Financial Consultant (CHFC) for a life, accident, and health license, or Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) or Certified Insurance Counselor (CIC) for a property and casualty license.\n\n(4) A producer may repeat a continuing education course, but credit must not be given more than once for a course repeated during a biennial compliance period.\n\n(B)(1) The director or his designee shall administer these continuing education requirements and shall approve courses of instruction which qualify for these purposes. However, the director may enter into reciprocal agreements with the insurance commissioners of other states regarding the approval of continuing education courses, sponsors, instructors, or proctors if, in his judgment, the arrangements or agreements are in the best interest of the State and if the proposed courses, sponsors, instructors, or proctors submitted meet the minimum statutory requirements of this State for approval. However, the director or his designee may not enter into or continue a reciprocal agreement unless the other state has requirements similar to this State in approving courses, sponsors, instructors, or proctors. In administering this program, the department, in its discretion, may promulgate regulations producers provide to a continuing education administrator established within the department proof of compliance with continuing education requirements as a condition of license renewal or, in the alternative, contract with an outside service provider to provide recordkeeping services as the continuing education administrator. The costs of the continuing education administrator must be paid from the continuing insurance education fees paid by producers in the manner provided by this section, except that course approval responsibilities may not be designated to the continuing education administrator. The continuing education administrator shall compile and maintain, in conjunction with insurers and producers, records reflecting the continuing insurance education status of all licensed or qualified producers subject to the requirements of this section. The continuing education administrator shall furnish to the insurer, as specified by regulation, a report of the continuing insurance education status of all of its producers. All licensed producers shall provide evidence of their continuing insurance education status to the continuing education administrator by the last day of the individual's month of birth. An individual born in an odd-numbered year shall comply every odd-numbered year. An individual born in an even-numbered year shall comply every even-numbered year.\n\n(2) The department may promulgate regulations prescribing the overall parameters of continuing education requirements, and these regulations expressly must authorize the director or his designee to recognize product-specific training offered by insurers. The director shall appoint an advisory committee to make recommendations with respect to courses offered for approval, but the director or his designee shall retain authority with respect to course approvals. When the advisory committee is approved, it shall meet regularly as needed, but no less than semiannually, to review new course applications. Also, the advisory committee shall review modifications of courses previously approved and review previously promulgated regulations to make recommendations regarding any need for modifications, deletions, or new regulations. In making these appointments, the director may accept nominations for qualified individuals from the Professional Insurance Agents of South Carolina; the Independent Insurance Agents of South Carolina; the South Carolina Association of Automobile Insurance Agents; the South Carolina Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers; the Association of South Carolina Life Insurance Companies; the Direct Writers Insurance Companies; insurers that are not members of any national insurance trade association; and another individual, group, or trade or professional association.\n\n(3) A vacancy on the advisory committee must be published in newspapers of general, statewide circulation. Each advisory committee member must be appointed for a term of two years and shall serve until his successor is appointed and qualified. A vacancy must be filled for the unexpired term only.\n\n(C) The appointment of a producer may not be renewed unless the producer has completed the mandated continuing insurance education requirements during the previous two-year accreditation period. The license of a producer who fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall lapse in accordance with the provisions of Section 38-43-110. Each insurer is responsible, biennially before renewal, for furnishing to the department certification that its producers meet the continuing insurance education requirements. Each producer is responsible for payment to the continuing education administrator a reasonable annual fee for operation of the continuing insurance education program. These fees are not refundable nor proratable and must be used to administer the provisions of this section.\n\n(D) This section also applies to nonresident producers unless otherwise provided in this section.

The director or his designee, in an order suspending a license, shall specify the period during which the suspension is to be in effect. The period may not exceed two years. A licensee whose license has been revoked or an applicant who has been refused a license by the director or his designee may not reapply for another license until a two-year period of time has lapsed from the effective date of the revocation or refusal or, if judicial review before the Administrative Law Court of the revocation or refusal is sought, after two years from the date of a final court order or decree affirming the revocation or suspension.\n\n(E) If, after notice of a hearing before the Administrative Law Court or notice of an opportunity for hearing before the Administrative Law Court, the director or his designee finds that one or more grounds exist for the revocation or suspension of, or the refusal to issue or reissue a license, the director or his designee, in his discretion, instead of revocation, suspension, or refusal, may impose upon the producer or applicant an administrative penalty as provided in Section 38-2-10 for each offense or ground.\n\n(F) The director or his designee may allow the producer or applicant a reasonable period, not to exceed thirty days, within which to pay to the director or his designee the amount of the penalty imposed. If the producer or applicant fails to pay the penalty in its entirety to the director or his designee at his office in Columbia within the period allowed, the license or application stands revoked, suspended, or renewal refused, as the case may be, upon expiration of the period and without any further proceedings.\n\n(G) Whenever the director or his designee nonrenews or denies an application for a license, the director or his designee shall notify the applicant or licensee and advise, in writing, the applicant or licensee of the reason for the denial or nonrenewal of the applicant's or licensee's license. The applicant or licensee may make written demand upon the Administrative Law Judge within thirty days for a hearing before the Administrative Law Judge to determine the reasonableness of the director or his designee's action. The hearing must be held pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\n(H) The license of an agency may be placed on probation, suspended, revoked or refused if the director or his designee finds, upon an investigation, that an individual licensee's violation was known or should have been known by one or more of the partners, officers, or managers acting on behalf of the agency and the violation was neither reported to the director or his designee nor corrective action taken.\n\n(I) In addition to or in lieu of any applicable denial, probation, suspension, or revocation of a license, a person violating this title may, after a hearing, be subject to an administrative penalty according to Section 38-2-10.\n\n(J) The director shall retain the authority to enforce the provisions of and impose any penalty or remedy authorized by this chapter and title against any person who is under investigation for or charged with a violation of this title even if the person's license or registration has been surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law.\n\nHISTORY: Former 1976 Code Section 38-43-130 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-662; 1962 Code Section 37-662] recodified as Section 38-73-110 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; Former 1976 Code Section 38-51-150 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code Section 37-241; 1962 Code Section 37-241; 1976 Act No. 455; 1981 Act No. 132, Section 1] recodified as Section 38-43-130 by 1987 Act No. 155, Section 1; 1988 Act No. 374, Section 16; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 663; 2002 Act No. 323, Section 2, eff January 31, 2003; 2008 Act No. 326, Section 11, eff June 16, 2008.",
