(B) Nothing herein abrogates or modifies in any way common law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person, insurer, or authorized agency. (C) Nothing herein limits the liability of any person or insurer who, with malice or in bad faith, makes a report of suspected fraud under the provisions of this article. (D) In addition to the immunity granted in this section, persons identified as designated employees whose responsibilities include the investigation and disposition of claims relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts may share information relating to persons suspected of committing fraudulent insurance acts with other designated employees employed by the same or other insurers whose responsibilities include the investigation and disposition of claims relating to fraudulent insurance acts, provided the department has been given written notice of the names and job titles of these designated employees prior to any designated employee sharing information. Unless the designated employees of the insurer act in bad faith or in reckless disregard for the rights of any insured, neither the insurer nor its designated employees are civilly liable for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort, and a civil action does not arise against the insurer or its designated employees: (1) for any information related to suspected fraudulent insurance acts provided to an insurer; or (2) for information related to suspected fraudulent insurance acts provided to the National Insurance Crime Bureau or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Provided, however, that the qualified immunity against civil liability conferred on any insurer or its designated employees shall be forfeited with respect to the exchange or publication of any defamatory information with third persons not expressly authorized by subsection (D) to share in such information.

(B) Delivery of a notice or document pursuant to this section must be considered equivalent to the following delivery methods: (1) first-class mail; and (2) first-class mail, postage prepaid. (C)(1) A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means by an insurer to a party if: (a) the party has affirmatively consented to the method of delivery and has not withdrawn consent; (b) the party, before giving consent, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement informing the party of: (i) the right or option of the party to have the notice or document provided or made available in paper or another non-electronic form at no additional cost; (ii) the right of the party at any time to withdraw his consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means; (iii) the specific notice or document or categories of notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means during the course of the relationship between the insurer and the party; (iv) the means, after consent is given, by which a party may obtain a paper copy of a notice or document delivered by electronic means at no additional cost; and (v) the procedure a party must follow to withdraw consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means and to update information needed to contact the party electronically; (c) the transmission or delivery method used for the electronic notice includes conspicuous language concerning its subject or purpose; (d) the party: (i) before giving consent, is provided with a statement of the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and (ii) consents electronically, or confirms consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the party can access information in the electronic form that will be used for notices or documents delivered by electronic means for which the party has given consent; and (e) after consent of the party is given, if a change occurs in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain a notice or document delivered by electronic means that creates a material risk that the party will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice or document to which the consent applies, then the insurer shall: (i) provide the party with a statement of the revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and (ii) comply with the requirements of subsection (A). (2) No insurer may cancel, refuse to issue, or refuse to renew a policy because the applicant or insured refuses to agree to receive mailings electronically pursuant to this subsection. (D) A hardcopy of a notice of cancellation, notice of non-renewal, or notice of termination must be delivered by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the last known mailing address of a party if the insurer knows that the notice of cancellation, notice of non-renewal, or notice of termination sent by electronic means was not received by the party. For the purposes of this subsection, the determination of whether an insurer sends, or a party receives, a notice of cancellation, notice of non-renewal, or notice of termination shall be governed by Section 26-6-150. (E) This section does not affect requirements related to content or timing of any notice or document required under applicable law. (F) If a provision of this title or other applicable law requiring a notice or document to be provided to a party expressly requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt of the notice or document, then the notice or document may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used provides for verification or acknowledgment of receipt. (G) The legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of the underlying contract or policy of insurance executed by a party may not be denied solely because of the failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent of the party pursuant to subsection (C)(1)(d)(ii). (H) A withdrawal of consent by a party: (1) does not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or document delivered by electronic means to the party before the withdrawal of consent is effective; and (2) is effective four business days after receipt of the withdrawal by the insurer. (I) Failure by an insurer to comply with subsection (C)(1)(e) may be treated, at the election of the party, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this section. (J) This section does not apply to a notice or document delivered by an insurer in an electronic form before the effective date of this section to a party who, before that date, had consented to receive notice or document in an electronic form otherwise allowed by law. (K) If the consent of a party to receive certain notices or documents in an electronic form is on file with an insurer before the effective date of this section and if, pursuant to this section, an insurer intends to deliver additional notices or documents to the party in an electronic form, then, prior to delivering such additional notices or documents electronically, the insurer shall notify the party of: (1) the notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means under this section that were not previously delivered electronically; and (2) the party's right to withdraw at any time consent to have notices or documents delivered by electronic means. (L) If a provision of this title or applicable law requires a signature, notice, or document to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, then the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by the provision, is attached to or logically associated with the signature, notice, or document. (M) This section may not be construed to modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Public Law 106-229, as amended. It is intended to provide an insurer additional options for the delivery of electronic notices and documents. An insurer choosing to use procedures outlined in ESIGN, UETA, or other applicable law or regulation governing such notice or documents must be considered to be in compliance with this section. (N) An insurer delivering a notice or document by electronic means shall take appropriate and necessary measures reasonably calculated to ensure that the system for furnishing the notices of documents is secure and protects the confidentiality of information as defined by applicable law. An insurer who is in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 45 C.F.R. 164.512(b), or the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, 16 C.F.R. 314.1, must be considered to be in compliance with this section. (O) An insurer delivering a notice or other document pursuant to this article shall retain records in the manner provided in Sections 26-6-120, 38-13-120, 38-13-140, and 38-13-160. (P) The director or his designee may promulgate, by bulletin, regulation, or order the requirements necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
