Control is presumed to exist if any person, directly, or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided by Section 38-21-220 that control does not exist in fact.

For the purposes of this section, \"controlling producer\" means a broker that:\n\n(1) places business on behalf of an insured with a licensed insurer;\n\n(2) controls or seeks to control a domestic insurer as that term is defined in Section 38-21-10(2); and\n\n(3) places, in any calendar year, an aggregate amount of gross written premium with the controlled insurer which is equal to or greater than five percent of the admitted assets of the controlled insurer as reported in the insurer's quarterly statement filed as of September thirtieth of the prior year.\n\n(B) Approval of the acquisition of a domestic insurer, whether a member of a holding company system or not, by a controlling producer may not be approved unless the following requirements are met:\n\n(1) A controlled insurer may not accept business from a controlling producer and a controlling producer may not place business with a controlled insurer unless there is a written contract between the controlling producer and the controlled insurer specifying the responsibilities of each party, which contract has been approved by the board of directors of the controlled insurer and which contains a provision:\n\n(a) that the controlled insurer may terminate the contract for cause, upon written notice to the controlling producer. The controlled insurer shall suspend the authority of the controlling producer to write business during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for the termination;\n\n(b) that the controlling producer shall render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges, and other fees received by, or owing to, the controlling producer;\n\n(c) that the controlling producer shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the controlled insurer on at least a monthly basis. The due date must be fixed so that premiums or installments of it collected must be remitted no later than ninety days after the effective date of any policy placed with the controlled insurer under this contract;\n\n(d) that all funds collected for the controlled insurer's account must be held by the controlling producer in a fiduciary capacity, in one or more appropriately identified bank accounts in banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System;\n\n(e) that the controlling producer shall maintain separately identifiable records of business written for the controlled insurer;\n\n(f) that the contract may not be assigned in whole or in part by the controlling producer;\n\n(g) that the controlled insurer shall provide the controlling producer with its underwriting standards, rules, procedures, manuals setting forth the rates to be charged, and the conditions for the acceptance or rejection of risks. The controlling producer shall adhere to the standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions. The standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions must be the same as those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by a producer other than the controlling producer;\n\n(h) establishing the rates and terms of the controlling producer's commissions, charges, or other fees and the purposes for those charges or fees. The rates of the commissions, charges, and other fees must be no greater than those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by producers other than controlling producers. For purposes of this subitem and subitem (g), examples of \"comparable business\" include the same lines of insurance, same kinds of insurance, same kinds of risks, similar policy limits, and similar quality of business;\n\n(i) that, if the contract provides that the controlling producer, on insurance business placed with the insurer, is to be compensated contingent upon the insurer's profits on that business, then that compensation must not be determined and paid until at least five years after the premiums on liability insurance are earned and at least one year after the premiums are earned on any other insurance. The commissions may not be paid until the adequacy of the controlled insurer's reserves on remaining claims has been independently verified pursuant to subsection (B)(3)(a);\n\n(j) limiting the controlling producer's writings in relation to the controlled insurer's surplus and total writings. The controlled insurer may establish a different limit for each line or subline of business. The controlled insurer shall notify the controlling producer when the applicable limit is approached and may not accept business from the controlling producer if the limit is reached. The controlling producer may not place business with the controlled insurer if it has been notified by the controlled insurer that the limit has been reached; and\n\n(k) that the controlling producer may negotiate but does not bind reinsurance on behalf of the controlled insurer on business the controlling producer places with the controlled insurer, except that the controlling producer may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the controlled insurer contains underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which these automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured, and commission schedules.\n\n(2) Each controlled insurer shall have an audit committee of the board of directors composed of independent directors. The audit committee shall meet annually with management, the controlled insurer's independent certified public accountants, and an independent casualty actuary, or other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the director or his designee to review the adequacy of the controlled insurer's loss reserves.\n\n(3)(a) In addition to another required loss reserve certification, the controlled insurer shall file annually, on April first of each year, with the director or his designee an opinion of an independent casualty actuary, or other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the director or his designee, reporting loss ratios for each line or subline of business written and attesting to the adequacy of loss reserves established for losses incurred and outstanding as of year-end, including incurred but not reported losses, on business placed by the controlling producer.\n\n(b) The controlled insurer shall report annually to the director or his designee the amount of commissions paid to the controlling producer, the percentage the amount represents of the net premiums written, and comparable amounts and percentages paid to noncontrolling producers for placements of the same kinds of insurance.\n\n(4) The controlling producer, before the effective date of the policy, shall deliver written notice to the prospective insured disclosing the relationship between the controlling producer and the controlled insurer, except that, if the business is placed through a subproducer who is not a controlling producer, the controlling producer shall retain in his records a signed commitment from the subproducer that the subproducer is aware of the relationship between the controlled insurer and the controlling producer and that the subproducer has or will notify the insured.\n\n(5)(a) If the director or his designee believes that the controlling producer or other person has not materially complied with this section, or regulation or order promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section, after notice and opportunity to be heard, the director or his designee may order the controlling producer to cease placing business with the controlled insurer.\n\n(b) If it was found that because of the material noncompliance that the controlled insurer or any policyholder of it has suffered any loss or damage, the director or his designee may maintain a civil action or intervene in an action brought by or on behalf of the controlled insurer or policyholder for recovery of compensatory damages for the benefit of the controlled insurer or policyholder or other appropriate relief.\n\n(c) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of the controlled insurer has been entered pursuant to Chapter 27, Title 38, and the receiver appointed under that order believes that the controlling producer or another person has not materially complied with this section, or regulation or order promulgated under it, and the controlled insurer suffered any loss or damage from it, the receiver may maintain a civil action for recovery of damages or other appropriate sanctions for the benefit of the controlled insurer.\n\n(d) Nothing contained in this section affects the right of the director or his designee to impose other penalties provided for in the insurance law.\n\n(e) Nothing contained in this section is intended to or in any manner alters or affects the rights of policyholders, claimants, creditors, or other third parties.\n\nHISTORY: 1993 Act No. 70, Section 3; 2009 Act No. 27, Section 4, eff June 2, 2009.",

If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under Section 38-21-10(2), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist, and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director or his designee;\n\n(b) the acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance if preacquisition notification is filed with the department in accordance with subsection (C)(1) thirty days before the proposed effective date of the acquisition. However, preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would be excluded by other provisions of this subsection;\n\n(c) the acquisition of already affiliated persons;\n\n(d) an acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:\n\n(i) in any market the combined market share of the involved insurers does not exceed five percent of total market;\n\n(ii) there is not an increase in a market share, or in any market the combined market share of the involved insurers does not exceed twelve percent of the total market, and the market share does not increase by more than two percent of the total market. For the purpose of this subitem a market means direct written insurance premium in this State for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this State;\n\n(e) an acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business;\n\n(f) an acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that:\n\n(i) the insurer is in failing condition;\n\n(ii) there is a lack of feasible alternatives to improving the condition;\n\n(iii) the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and\n\n(iv) the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director or his designee.\n\n(C)(1) An acquisition covered by subsection (B) may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection (E) unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification. The director or his designee shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under subsection (C) in the same manner provided in Section 38-21-290.\n\n(2) The preacquisition notification must be in a form and contain information prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subsection B(2)(e), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The director or his designee may require additional material and information necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, violates the competitive standard of subsection (D). The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this State accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of the person indicating ability to render an informed opinion.\n\n(3) The required waiting period begins on the date of receipt of the department of a preacquisition notification and ends on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of receipt or termination of the waiting period by the Director or his designee. Before the end of the waiting period, the director or his designee on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition. If he does, the waiting period ends on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the department or termination of the waiting period by the director or his designee.\n\n(D)(1) The director or his designee may enter an order under subsection (E) (1) with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be to lessen competition substantially in a line of insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (C).\n\n(2) In determining whether a proposed acquisition violates the competitive standard of item (1), the director or his designee shall consider the following:\n\n(a) An acquisition covered under subsection (B) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standards:\n\n(i) if the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer A Insurer B 4% 4% or more 10% 2% or more 15% 1% or more\n\n(ii) if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer A Insurer B 5% 5% or more 10% 4% or more 15% 3% or more 19% 1% or more\n\nA highly concentrated market is one of which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in item (1). For the purpose of this item, the insurer with the largest share of the market is Insurer A.\n\n(b) It must be determined whether there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market. The trend exists when the aggregate market share of a grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over time extending from a base year five to ten years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. An acquisition or merger covered under subsection (B) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard in item (1) if all of the following exist:\n\n(i) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market.\n\n(ii) One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of the large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share.\n\n(iii) Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more.\n\n(c) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under this item, the director or his designee may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under this item, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination include, but are not limited to: market shares, volatility of the ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(d) For the purpose of this item:\n\n(i) \"Insurer\" includes a company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control.\n\n(ii) \"Market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets the director or his designee shall give due consideration to the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business. The line is that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this State, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this State.\n\n(iii) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard rests upon the director or his designee.\n\n(3) An order must not be entered under subsection (E)(1) if the acquisition will:\n\n(a) yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be achieved feasibly in another way, and the public benefits which would arise from the economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or\n\n(b) substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.\n\n(E)(1)(a) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the director or his designee may enter an order:\n\n(i) requiring an involved insurer to stop doing business in this State with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or\n\n(ii) denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this State.\n\n(b) An order must not be entered unless all of the following exist:\n\n(i) There is a hearing.\n\n(ii) Notice of the hearing is issued before the end of the waiting period and not less than fifteen days before the hearing.\n\n(iii) The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than sixty days after the end of the waiting period. An order must be accompanied by a written decision of the director or his designee setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(c) An order does not become final earlier than thirty days after it is issued. Before it becomes final the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon the plan or other information, the director or his designee shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified.\n\n(d) An order does not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.\n\n(2) A person who violates an order under item (1), while the order is in effect, after notice and hearing, and upon order of the director or his designee, is subject at his discretion to one or more of the following:\n\n(a) monetary penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for each day of violation;\n\n(b) suspension or revocation of license.\n\n(3) An insurer or other person who fails to make a filing required by this section and who fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with a filing requirement is subject to a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\n(F) Sections 38-21-320, 38-21-330, and 38-21-350 do not apply to acquisitions under subsection (B).\n\nHISTORY: 1991 Act No. 13, Section 2; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 571; 2015 Act No. 2 (S.342), Section 8, eff March 9, 2015.",

      "text": "(A) The director is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this section. However, the director may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:\n\n(1) does not have substantial insurance operations within the United States;\n\n(2) has substantial insurance operations in the United States but not in South Carolina; or\n\n(3) has substantial insurance operations in the United States and South Carolina, but the director has determined that another regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor pursuant to the factors set forth in this section.\n\nAn insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the director make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor.\n\n(B) In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the director will identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The director may determine that he is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in this State. However, the director may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The director shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment:\n\n(1) the place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that holds the largest share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities;\n\n(2) the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(3) the location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(4) whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system that the director determines to be:\n\n(a) substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of this State; or\n\n(b) otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise-risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and\n\n(5) whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the director with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.\n\nHowever, a director identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor must be made after consideration of the factors listed above, in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group, and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding another provision of law, when another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the director shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor. However, in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in the internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in this State holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets, or liabilities or this State being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group, the director shall make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for such an internationally active insurance group.\n\n(D) Pursuant to the provisions of Section 38-21-280, the director is authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to this section all information necessary to determine whether the director may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the director may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the director, the director shall notify the insurer registered pursuant to this section and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have no less than thirty days to provide the director with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The director shall publish in the State Register and on its website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the director has determined are subject to group-wide supervision.\n\n(E) If the director is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director is authorized to engage in the following group-wide supervision activities:\n\n(1) assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:\n\n(a) the material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and\n\n(b) reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;\n\n(2) request from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the director's supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk including, but not limited to, information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:\n\n(a) governance, risk assessment, and management;\n\n(b) capital adequacy; and\n\n(c) material intercompany transactions;\n\n(3) coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of such internationally active insurance groups that are engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n(4) communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 38-21-290, through supervisory colleges as set forth in Section 38-21-285 or otherwise;\n\n(5) enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered pursuant to this section, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the director's role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation must not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this State is doing business in this State or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this State; and\n\n(6) other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated, as considered necessary by the director.\n\n(F) If the director acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the director is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor, provided that the:\n\n(1) director's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this State; and\n\n(2) regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the director's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the director is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.\n\n(G) The director is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered pursuant to this chapter, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.\n\n(H) The director may promulgate regulations necessary for the administration of this section.\n\n(I) A registered insurer subject to this section is liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the director's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and any other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.\n\nHISTORY: 2019 Act No. 3 (S.75), Section 2, eff March 20, 2019.",
